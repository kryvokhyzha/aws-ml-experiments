0,The color and embellishment of this top are beautiful. this would look great on anyone super lean  otherwise you just look really wide as there is no frame in the torso of this top at all. the back picture shows it well. i am 5'9  142 lbs and i ordered the small and medium and both were huge! with regrets going back.
1,The model does not look as good in this shirt as it looks in real life. it is flowy  flattering  and elegant  not to mention warm and soft. i hope it holds up!
1,"Love the clean lines  the texture  and the slight sheen on this skirt which does run a bit large in the waist. the online photos are very true to what the fabric looks like. it is a stiffer  but lightweight fabric so the skirt stands away from the body. the quality of the finish is excellent and i really appreciate the hidden zipper and pockets. . fit: runs large in the waist. the size 2 i have measures 27"" on the top inside of the waistband  and i think the model is wearing a size too loose oth"
1,I was so excited to see these pants on sale. they fit beautifully and drape well. the hidden lining of 'shorts' is a great feature and i will get 3 seasons of use from these.  now if i could only get them in plain black too ....
-1,First of all it arrived rolled in a tight ball the size of a large starbucks coffee. i don't know why they do that.... you're not going to be immediately impressed by something that is packaged like it's cheap! second  i'm usually a 0-4 in retailer and mine is no where near as loose-fitting as the photo. also  he sleeves and back are a very thin waffle knit... like a flimsy t-shirt. and see-thru. the sleeves form-fit to my arms so i couldn't layer under it  but i couldn't wear it alone with the fa
-1,To be clear i am not built like your models but the biggest problem was the way in which it tented out from the bustline down
1,I like these pants. they fit nice but they are sheer which is not a problem for me. my only issue was that the print is not symmetrical as shown in the picture. the print is what drew me to these pants. the pattern is all over the place in the ones i received. they are nice so i will keep them at the sale price but i don't think they would be worth it at full price.
0,Not sure about this yet. reordered larger size because it hits much higher than shown. belly peeked out from under it! ordered 6 and i'm normally a small/6. like the design but really short. 
-1,I've never had a problem with pilcro jeans. i own several pairs. however  i ordered my regular size 28 (i'm 5'3  120 pounds) and not only were these jeans thin  they had zero stretch and after 1 hour of wear stretched out horribly. they fit really loose and hung around my knees and legs which is very disappointing for a skinny jean.
-1,Even following the care label exactly  it shrunk ~3 inches in the length and overall in the diameter. i had to return this since i am tall and it looked more like a work-inappropriate mini after the first wash.
0,Purchased this should in the blue motif in size small. i am usually between a small and medium in shirts  36c broad shoulders. the fit was fine in the small. however  i had a few issues with the top: 1) the blue motif looked actually like a faded blue (as if it had been washed quite a few times and looked worn)  2) the front mid/bottom section laid strangely and gave me a maternity look  and 3) the back has alot of fabric (see back of tank in white motif) and was very voluminous. for me  it wasn
-1,The dress is very pretty  but the sequins are dark blue! i imagined they would be silver/gold  given the photo  but the dress is essentially light pink and blue.
1,I just got this top and can't wait to wear it for spring/summer! it is a lovely lightweight material and hangs loosely and comfortably. it definitely runs quite large so i would at the very least consider ordering on the small side of what you normally wear if not sizing down one completely. this is coming from someone who usually likes tops on the roomier side  so trust me on this! overall  i highly recommend this top if you're looking for a muted but unique  comfy top for the warmer months ahe
1,Dolan is my go to for comfy  pretty  practical dresses. i'm 5'0 125 lbs and i consistently wear a petite small in this brand. i bought the taupe - not my favorite color  but i had too many lbds and the green was not a summer color. i chose taupe to wear with my bronze and turquoise jewelry. summer must have.
-1,I bought an xl and they looked like they would have been a small. can't review anything else because i couldn't even get them on.... ridiculous
0,I like the pattern and material on this top but the bubble hem isn't flattering on my figure. i would recommend this top if you are tiny and petite.
0,These are very well constructed  medium weight  besutiful leggings.
-1,This top is tight across the bust (i am a 32dd cup) and more trapeze-shaped than the picture shows. if you are smaller busted  it may not flare out as much. also- the sz 10 is what was tight - and i usually wear a sz. 4 or 6  or small-size top/blouse. in the end  this wasn't very flattering as it looked more like a maternity top.
1,I love this top! i debated between an xs and a s  but i'm usually an xs in deletta so that's what i got. it fits perfectly and is beautiful.
-1,Like one of the previous reviewers  when my jacket arrived  it was not in the great dark wash pictured online. it was in a basic  medium denim wash. i like the wash pictured online; i did not like the wash the jacket came in. additionally  know that it is just huge. i ordered my usual size (medium) and understood that the jacket was meant to be roomy and swingy  but there is no way that one size down would be enough to compensate for how swimmingly large it was. i never tried an xs  but it was s
-1,I loved this dress when i saw it online  perfect for a summer wedding  but when i tried it on i was very disappointed. the fabric and styling are gorgeous and very high quality but the sheer amount of fabric on this dress is just not as pictured. there is layer after layer of silk and ruffle and while lovely  it made me look very large. i tried tying the belt many ways to no avail. sadly  it will have to go back. it may look good on a very thin frame but didn't complement my average one.
0,I really wanted this swimsuit to work and it looks really nice in person and good quality as well  but sadly the top is cut really strangely. in the photo shown of the model  it looks like a v-neck that kinda gives your boobs a little push to the middle for some slight cleavage. however  that's not how it fit for me. the cups have removable padding on this suit  and when left in  my boobs didn't even fit in the thing and it just looked really awkward in general. and with the padding taken out  m
0,"Great cut and fit. tts. size 6 fit my 5'5""  135 pound frame (34b/c bust) wonderfully. my sister and best friend loved it on. but i'm returning. the color is more of a very bright orange than red. i would want to wear this in the middle of summer but the all-polyester fabric is hot. i have too many dresses in my closet. cute as it is  i'd just never pick this one. love to see this design in lighter fabric and different color options. 1-2"" longer would also be a slightly better length."
0,Gorgeous color! salmon not pink though! lovely soft drape fabric but the itty bity thread and hook in the center is awful! i am a size 2/4 d cup and ordered a small and the closure is not adequate at all! it looks terrible closed and is too revealing without a cami underneath. does not fit like the model!
1,Comfortable t eh fabric is very soft. the embroidery adds a little to the otherwise plain black tunic. lace up neck on trend too.     i ordered the xxs p  as it is likely loose... that was just fine for me  xs p would have been not as flattering. theo nly problem with that is the sleeves then became a little more snug (workout arms). not too snug that i can't wear the dress  but decided not to keep it only because there are way too many things i like at retailer! (and have to pick). in my wish lis
0,Note: if you have a large chest  the seams hit in an unflattering spot. nice shirt  just not great for the price.
0,"I don't usually write reviews but this one definitely needs it. i bought this shirt in the wine color in a small. i'm 5'6"" 135lbs and usually wear a small in retailer clothing. loved the color and fit of this shirt  a little longer and loose with unique detailing on the sides. i loved the wine color so much i bought the gray and white stripe one as well. when i bought the gray and white one i had to try on 5-6 smalls before finding one that fit just right. there was a significant difference in the"
-1,This dress looks amazing on-line. in person the arm ruffles are much larger and stick out  and the dress at the bottom makes you look like strawberry shortcake. too much all over ruffling at the chest and is not flattering. pattern is dizzying in person.     very thin multi layer dress. should be better material and quality for this price. save your money and shipping.
-1,I absolutely fell in love with these comfy palazzo pants and imagined that i'd be wearing them all summer long. they fit beautifully  were true to size  and seemed to go with every top i owned. unfortunately  on the second wear  the inseam completely unraveled  leaving a foot-long gaping hole in the leg. i also noticed some stray threads along the other seams  so i'm not thrilled with the quality. it seems like they were poorly manufactured. i'm not sure if i just purchased a faulty pair or if t
0,"This is really a cute top  nice fabric  the print (the version i bought) is lovely though the colors are different than pictured. the problem for me is that i am 5'8""  36b with a longer torso and the proportions were just wrong on my body. the blouse does not have much shape at all and fell a bit too short for my liking  especially in the front. it hit at hip level  as in photo  but would look so much better if it had been a couple inches longer. looking at the other reviews i see that most of t"
1,Perfect high rise jeans - just a little bit of stretch for comfort. the high waist doesn't roll down and no knicker cleavage when bending over. perfect to go with crop tops
0,Cute shirt but not worth the price. i did purchase it at 20% off but would have waited for a better sale. the yellow is a nice fall color
0,I am all for a cute flowy tee but this one felt like i was swimming a bit. if you're a true xs  i'd skip this one. however  if you are able to size down i think it would look really great!
1,"I've been desperate for a swim cover that covers my arms & back. this one fits nicely--just a pretty  feminine  happy summer top that still lets me be leggy. i can't see them in the photos  but the embroidery detail at the upper part of this top has little mirrors sewn among the dots. very fun! i'm 5'5"" and when i paired this with jean shorts  everything below the crotch was visible--so perhaps slightly shorter than it appears in the pics."
1,I love this shirt. it is so soft. not boxy at all. very flattering. my only complaint is that there aren't more colors!
-1,1. i like a shorter jacket  but this one was poorly made and poorly fit.  2. the sleeves were way too tight. i'm a size 10 or 12  and the large which would be a 14 had tight sleeves that wrinkled up my arms  and the hem of the sleeve turned inside out.  3. i ordered both a medium (size 10) and a large (size 14)   and neither hung right. the m too tight  and the large too loose in the body and too tight in the sleeves.  4. very polyester with lots of static.  5. cute idea  but not very good in pe
-1,I thought that this dress would be perfect for my 60th birthday  however i was disappointed when i received it. it is extremely heavy from the beading and i just did not find it pretty in person. it did nothing for me. also  it runs small and was tight.
1,Love the pattern on this lightweight cardigan and it is super flattering. i tried ordering the xs/s first because the next size up just sounded too big  but i ultimately had to order up for more room in shoulders and length in arms  though. i'm hoping the m/l fits without too much spare fabric because it really is a great piece.
-1,Nice quality fabric and design  but found the armhole cut weirdly and fit of upper bodice strange. wanted to love it but sadly sent it back
0,This is a cute dress but the fabric is very heavy and i didn't find it to drape well on me. it is a very heavy felted poly type of fabric. i ordered it for a specific event coming up this summer and the fabric will not work for warm temps. the style and design of the dress is great though. for reference it did fit fairly true to size. i wear a 0 or 2. the xs fit well. if the fabric works for your situation then i would try this dress.
1,Bought these pants for a long trip through south east asia. tried them on at home and instantly fell in love with the relaxed yet styled look. will be incredibly versatile on my trip which i need as i am bringing only ~15 pounds of luggage including the bag. they seem breathable and are light weight. super flattering as they are slightly slimming and don't bunch up at the waste. i got the greenish color.
-1,Waist is tight and thighs and legs are not. -not flattering- ankle opening is too small  and they have a funny smell.
-1,The cups on this suit are  ridiculous.  unless you are going to a nudist beach i do not recommend.  the construction of the suit itself was also vey poor. seams were messed up  a big pull right on the front-- i brought it back. sad because the design was adorable- just poor execution.
1,Omg! where have you been all my life? this t-shirt is the best....not see-through  perfect length  perfect v-neck (no cami required)  amazing colors  perfect shape  not tight (body skimming)  doesn't poof out or look weird on larger busts and goes with everything from jeans to dress pants. i want every color  but for now i ordered the moss and blue which goes perfectly with my fair skin and long silver hair. oh and did i mention the sleeves are perfect to wear with or without a cardigan! no slee
0,"I loved the color and the neckline was flattering. however  it would have fit me better in a petite size bc i am 5'3"" and a 32f. it fits slim so to fit in my bust it was too long. also didn't think the fabric was good quality for this price."
0,I liked the idea of this t-shirt dress for a great basic wardrobe staple; however  i feel that it was overpriced for the quality. it's a nice piece but i would wait for it to go on sale.
0,Absolutely stinning dress! statement piece for sure however i will agree with other reviews that the bust is small and has no give or wiggle room with the side zipper...one if those dreaded side zippers that you always fear breaking as you dress. sizing up would help but the waist then appears too big or bulky.. i am on the fence about whether or not it's a keeper ...definitely perfect for the smaller chested. i usually wear xs size 2/4 the 6 zipped the 4 nearly did but would've smashed. neverth
-1,"This dress is horrible. i can't believe they can get away with calling it a ""dress"". it should have been called a tunic or shirt. it looks like it is a soft flowing dress made out of nice material from the pictures  no way. it is made from sweatshirt material it is lifeless and is kind of stiff. it came to the top of my thighs. i can't find one nice thing to say about this dress and i do not recommend it. the picture does it so much more justice that it is worth."
1,While there us no clasp and this bra does require you to pull it over your head  i did not find it to be too difficult. i love that the bra stays in place and that i do not have to constantly pull it up throughout the day! it's quite comfortable too. i wish i had ordered the same bra with the straps too before they sold out of my size!
0,There is nothing special about this skirt. it's plain and incredibly dowdy looking. long and wide. i am usually between a small and medium. after reading the other review that said the waist ran small i went with a medium. it fit fine in the waist/hips.
-1,Just recently purchased and think it's ok for the price. would never pay full on this one & that's from an retailer shopper who's purchased plenty at full price. design is cute but definitely looks like a sleep shirt esp in the lighter color  so-so on construction - the bottom seams pucker slightly  the pockets bunch up weirdly (steaming/laundering don't help) & the shoulders also hunch up oddly. could be because of the thicker fabric sewn to the knit but laundering didn't help that issue either.
1,These pants have a very odd design but they are so soft and so comfortable i could not resist. going on a trip to key west and thought they would be great for the plane ride. they fit true to size. could not pass up as they were on sale.
-1,"I agree with other reviewers. it is beautiful but too tight around the chest. i am usually an xsmall and the xsmall was tight in the chest. i bought the small and it was still uncomfortable. sadly i had to return it. i am 5'4""  134 lbs and a 34c  by no means i am considered big chested so this is highly unusual."
-1,Cute top but started disintegrating after two washes. the delicate cutouts in the top tore apart. i machine washed it in the gentle cycle and didn't use the dryer. disappointed to have to discard the top after just buying it.
-1,This dress is cuter is person than online  but it has one huge issue - there is a teeny tiny button at the neck that is held on by a thread and requires fingers the size of a two year old to get open. it fell off the minute i tried to undo it. i can't believe these other reviewers didn't have the same problem. or  maybe they put a snap there instead. too bad.
-1,Unique jacket..... but when i put it on i felt and looked like charlie brown. this will be going back.
1,"Overall  this swimsuit is what i needed and have been looking for. i normally wear bikinis but i needed a one piece  and i wanted something unique and different. i ordered the chevron print  and i do love the colors and ""retro"" look of the swimsuit. if i could change a couple of things  i would have the legs and booty slightly more high cut -- but not much. and i might have wanted the option to take off some  if not all  of the straps. other than that  i do love it...and i doubt that anyone else"
0,The details on this dress were pretty  but it was super poofy and i felt like it made me look bigger than i am. maybe if you have a straight body and want to create curves this would work for that  but not great on an hourglass/pear shaped figure. fits tts.
0,Ordered this vest in both the xs and pxs. i liked the length and overall fit of the xs  however  i ended up returning both due to how the vest draped. the outer fabric is a bit more stiff which made the vest balloon out more then what i liked. overall  it?s not a terrible vest but just not for me.
0,This was pretty to look at: nice weight  lining  colors. i tried it on and whoa. ridiculously bad. i have broad shoulders and a small waist and this accentuated the broadness of my shoulders and eliminated any hint of shape below that. the model photo looks great  so i imagine this will look great on anyone with slim shoulders and narrow hips. definitely not for me  though...
1,This vest is the one thing i will wear all year round. i couldn't wait for this to arrive  it looks and fits just like the pictures. great quality and value  is very stylish and adds a little flair to a simple top and jeans outfit. i have worn it several times and  in addition to looking great does keep you warm.
1,This is quite long on my 5'1 frame but it's wool and will be amazing in the fall and winter. so happy i finally ordered this
1,I'm 5'2 and bought the dress in a petite medium. i like to buy clothes that i can wear to work and this dress was almost too short. if it were any shorter  it wouldn't have worked. if i were to buy it again  i'd probably go with a non-petite size. also  i ordered the dress online and i found two snags in it as soon as i pulled it out of the box. i don't think they will be terribly noticeable  but just beware that this dress will apparently snag easily. i plan to wear it with a purse without meta
1,I love the print of this dress; the deep blue really is striking. i agree with the other reviewers that it has no lining and therefore  it's hard to justify the price. i can't seem to part with it yet due to the lovely print and the off the shoulder style is romantic and flattering. still on the fence. . . it would be better as a sale piece.
1,I really like the style and cute stripes and i love the versatility of the design of this shirt. fits true to size and hides my stomach just in the right places
0,I love the way the mock neck style looks  but the shirt is cut very small. i realize it's supposed to stretch  but it's still very  very tight on  particularly in the shoulder area. if you like the style  i'd recommend sizing up.
1,Thin for this late in the season  but the colors are so pretty. i'm going to layer it over a long sleeve t  top with a cardi and pair with leggings. runs large. love the the unconnected slip. 5 stars.
1,I was looking for a romper for a long time which i don't need to care whether to wear bras after taking shower and relax. because of its design with a line on the top  no worries for a relaxed romper. the texture was not as silky as i wished but you will like this if you want a light on weight.
0,The sweater fits a bit awkward in the front. it draped more than i would have liked. also  the transition from the stripes to the solid gray felt non cohesive because of the stitching. returned the item.
-1,I can always count on retailer to sell unique pieces  so when i saw this sweatshirt online  i ordered it right away.  it&#39;s adorable and quirky  however  when i received it in the mail  it reminded me of something my grandma would wear.  the sleeves are puff sleeves and are really long  while the bottom of the sweatshirt hit pretty high on my waist that when i raised my arms my stomach was showing.  if this was a more tailored sweatshirt  i would be keeping it  but sadly it&#39;s going back.
-1,I do not even know where to begin with this product. i ordered a small (i go between small and medium) and felt that would be a good fit. after trying on the shirt  i would have opted for the xxxxxxxxs or whatever the smallest size is. this shirt is very boxy. i know its supposed to have a 'flow' to it  but this shirt is too much. it needs to be taken in. or have a belt wrapped around it. i tried the belt look but it did not look flattering. i found this color to be very blah. overall  i am slig
0,I really liked the color and style of this dress  but the proportions were off. the top was too small and the waist was too large. if you are more uniform in size/shape and less of an hourglass this dress may be perfect for you!
1,I received this dress as a gift and it has become such a great addition to my wardrobe! i love that i can wear it to work and then out with friends. a great value if you're looking for one special piece that you can get miles out of - you can wear the two pieces separate or together. i love floral and felt this non traditional take on a floral was very refreshing.
0,I ordered the stress in an xl. i usually wear a size 12 in most retailer clothes. the pattern and the flow of the dress is very beautiful but it runs extremely small. also  i felt that i was choking. it is better suited for thin women.
0,This skirt runs very large--even in the petite line. there was also no shape to the skirt (at least as it looked on my body). the color was nice (in the pink-grapeish hue)  but ultimately the skirt just looked like a tent on my body (00p).
-1,I was able to get this on sale. when it arrived  it was missing half of the rhinestones. i am very surprised that this top would be sent out this way. it also was missing the little bag with extra stones. i'm reaching out and wondering if anyone else has experienced this and is there a store that sells rhinestones like the one on the blouse? any help from anyone would be appreciated. i hate to part with this  but where was quality control?
0,Super cute  flattering design but the material is itchy so it's going back:(
1,Very pretty dress! wearing it for a family beach portrait. it may run a little big but not terribly. it is also not super long as pictured. i'm 5'6 and it's perfect with a flat.
1,"I bought this blouse at the store today and i love it! they stylist brought it for me to try on with the green chinos and it was perfect. it will go with jeans or dark pants as well. very unique and flattering! i got a size 2. i'm 5'7'"" and 130 pounds."
-1,Even on sale  this was just too pricey for what it is  which is a glorified tank. i liked the straps  but it hangs very wide off your chest.
-1,I disliked this dress. it didn't fall on me the way it falls on the model pictured. i think it would work well for tall  thin women with a smaller chest. i am petite with a larger chest  and it accentuated my chest in an unflattering way and managed to make me look frumpy at the same time. not recommended for petite women.
0,Cute shirt but no worth full price for sure. runs small in the bust. and i am not busty at all. definitely order up a size. i am returning mine  however  because of size and price.
-1,I thought this top would be a little more form fitting than it is. there is so much extra fabric near the bottom it is almost like a swing style top. the fabric will most definitely snag  as it is not a linen or cotton top material but rather a silky type and also very thin - not very good quality. i got the smallest size possible and it was absolutely huge  everywhere but the neck.
1,"These ""jeans"" definitely look more like pants and are very snug  but stretchy. i'm 5'10 and ordered the tall  and mine are a little longer than shown on the model. they look nice on  but are a tad tighter than i anticipated."
1,"This is such an easy dress to wear and it looks very polished! it is not a ""cheap polyester"" fabric as one reviewer wrote. it is a rayon and nylon blend. it does wrinkle easily. i love that the belt is actually sewn into the dress at the back. i don't typically gravitate toward warm color palette  but the burnt orange color is really lovely. it can be dressed up or down very easily. and it has pockets! i typically wear xs in retailer brands  and the size 0 fit me well."
-1,Darling jacket/coat  similar styling as the beige with big flowers and lace-up back that i bought a few years ago and still love. i was considering this one  but the description says to hand wash. seriously? a coat? that's simply not practical. not sure if i will buy this one.
0,The tee is adorable in the floral print. the fit is true to size  as it is a casual tee rather than overly fitted. the cuffed sleeves are a nice detail. i would have bought this at full price  but it is quite see through in the white/yellow floral. i could easily see my nude colored bra and even my belly button it was so sheer. having to wear a tank underneath this completely defeats the purpose of a cute  casual tee you can just throw on. i was so disappointed that it was so sheer. i think the
0,Bought this shirt because i loved the cut and the stripes. had little to no shape to it. some may think it runs big but it appears that is the look this top is going for. i feel like being short  i just looked kind of dumpy on me. fabric is nice but borders on see through. it was just ok....nothing exciting.
-1,I am now the third person to try this dress and return it for the same reason. the empire waist is too high and hits across the bust instead of underneath it. i can't imagine how they got it to fit this model so well. i am petite and i really love the idea of a maxi with sleeves  so i decided to try it even through the two previous reviewers reported this issue. unfortunately  i had the same problem. i am a c+ cup size. perhaps this would work on a very thin figure with a small bust. i ordered t
1,Loving this jumpsuit! i normally a medium top small bottom i bought the medium it fits right. soft fabric and nice color.
-1,Purchased this item on sale-received it and it had two huge holes on the side.not possible to repair. very disappointed in lack of quality control. :(
-1,I've been wearing this very comfortable and cute coat for 2 weeks. it is already tearing at the seams somehow. the quality of this is very poor.
0,This dress caught my eye online and i had to have it. when it arrived it was still just as pretty as i remembered. beautiful  vibrant colors and a unique oversized floral on a flirty  swishy fabric. unfortunately the cut was really strange. after reading several reviews i went with an xs  but i'm not sure a s would have solved all the fit problems i was having. while everything from the waist down fit perfectly  the arms were cut too tight  the chest was huge and yet i struggled to zip it up. an
0,I tried this on in the store - i tried regular medium which was way too big except in the chest where it was really tight. the material was a little itchy on me (but maybe its because the chest was tight). the color is lovely (pink). im sure someone will love it but if you are petite  i would order the petite and maybe size up if you are busty.
0,I ordered this in the pink color. the fit was fine  but i didn't care for how thin it was. there is lining  which i suppose is there to combat the thinness  but it's only in certain places. the lining should have been all over. maybe if i had gotten this in blue  it wouldn't have been so bad.
1,I gave this in her brighter rose colored print and love it! i get many compliments on this top! i did size up from my usual small to a medium to accommodate the girls :)
0,"Like the other reviewers  i agree that this sweater is waaaay shorter than it looks on the model. i think she's wearing a large size and it's probably cinched in the back. still cute  though! i'm 5'9"" 145 and a medium fits well -- looks cute with high-waisted jeans (which i wear anyway)."
1,Love a gray sweater and this one is stunning. layered with a plaid tunic and worn to work  with many compliments. the only downside is the poncho shape  with the large wing like sleeves  makes it impossible to wear a coat over this sweater. if you wanted to wear in the winter cold  you would need a cape. also not an ideal piece if you need to lift your arms for any reason. keeping that in mind though  i still really like it for days when i want to look cute and won't be don't a ton of moving aro
-1,I have blazers in size 8 from this designer and they fit with room to spare. i understand this is a more fitted style  but it is still way too small. size 10 and size 12 were not much bigger. great colors and cute design  but just too small even if you do not plan on buttoning it. i hope they bring back this jacket but make it true to size.
-1,"In paper crown dresses  i wear a small or size 6  so for this top  i ordered a small. it was huge on me! for reference  i'm 5'7""  130 lbs  34a. it is very wide towards the bottom  and it flares out way more than in the picture. the material is also a little stiff  so it really sticks out. even if i sized down to the xs  i think the bottom would still look unflattering  so i'm returning this."
0,Great quality top. i do wish it fit me...i'm really long waisted and this top was too short. had to return
1,"Not sure why this says ""online exclusive"" as i bought it in green in the store. i also saw it in a mustard color at another location. but in any case  this is an adorable and flattering dress. fabric is kind of a chino. weighty but not too heavy. great color and design. runs a bit small. my normal size was snug and i thought that in the summer heat i would not want it that clingy so went up a size. i love it and would buy it in more colors!"
0,Color is beautiful but looks like a maternity top on. i found i could tuck it in slacks and it looked fine. now for the cons:  it is supposed to be peacock design but i had only one peacock under my arm  which could be seen  i guess  if i waved. the rest were parts of the bird. i would love to have the one in the photos!  next  who thought cheap white buttons on the back was a good idea?  if i had gotten a nice patterned top  i would have replaced the buttons. blouses that i like never seem to b
-1,These would have been the perfect black pants! great cut  love the wide band in the front  true to size  quality construction. but a zipper in the back?!!! i had to ask my husband to help me zip them up. perhaps they would be easier to put on if my bum were a little smaller  but the pants fit perfectly - they were just too hard to put on. sending them back  since i don't have an assistant to zip them up whenever i need.
1,Buy it. buy it right now! this dress is gorgeous  and would be on anyone. i don't care what size you are  it's so pretty  that you feel pretty in it! i loved wearing it  and since i am in florida  i can wear it all year long. so it's worth it. happy  very happy  with this purchase!
1,I liked this dress but wasn't sure about the color on me. i tried it on anyway. originally  i tried on the 0  but it seemed big so i ordered the 00. also usually i order petite  but this dress is already short (and i am not getting younger)  so i went with regular size this time. color was not bad on my pale skin  i think the hue was ok (surprisingly). one thing that might bug the perfectionist in me  the zig zag isn't always aligned  the waist  for instance was crooked  but if it is like that e
-1,I really loved this dress in the store when i tried it on the color and fabric were perfect for summer but once i got this home i noticed the placket wouldn't lay flat across the bust like shown in pictures. when i went up a size it was too large under the arms so this one will sadly have to go back to the store.
-1,Poor quality. i expected much more from the material.
1,This dress looks better when wearing  i am 5.8 regular size s or 6. cup 34 d and fits perfect. length and width. in the front is shorter while the back has that pretty extra length. the video that is showing here is pretty much the full length.  but in case you need to adjust you can shorten easily. i wish the slip is the same length as the dress. i want this dress for a wedding anniversary by the beach so i will need to add some extra fabric. i hope it helps.
-1,Bummer  i fell in absolute love with these gems until i realized how weak the stretch is by the end of the day. i purchased them on the 13th of feb and can't bare to wear them anymore.
0,I ordered a six 6 petite. the pant leg was still very long. and if i have it tailored it will not preserve the whole point of these pants having a flare. this is a slim fit. i have heavy thighs and this was not for me. i'm 5' 120 lbs. also the tag warns that the fabric may leave color on lighter clothing. which i don't get  because it's spandex blend. also wasn't too hip in the zipper on the back.
1,This is a fun dress to have in your closet! i ordered the 4p  and it was just a little to short for my taste. had the regular 4 sent  and it was perfect! i wore it the very next night to a party... feels great and lots of fun with the bel sleeves!
-1,This dress was adorable & fit great! regrettably  i had to return it since it wasn't lined.
-1,Really wanted to love  the top was very flattering and loved the material: very swingy and forgiving. but way to much material  i was drowning in it. sized down to x small but no go.
1,"This is so pretty! it was beautiful in white but i bought the blue because the fabric is a little bit see through. i'm 5' 4"" and weigh about 135 and this shirt fit just like on the model in the picture. it was a nice neat loose. not sloppy at all."
0,It's hard enough for women to find clothing that will make them look as beautiful as they feel but add a bigger bust size (i'm a 36dd) and it makes it this much harder. i ordered this top because of how beautiful it looked on the model and the price. when it arrived i was so excited! retailer does such a beautiful job with the way they handle their items! it was wrapped beautiful and no damage. i ordered a size 8 knowing that my chest could be a potential problem. the too itself is gorgeous! i did
0,"The fabric is wonderful  flows nicely and soft. i am 5'7""  145lbs and usually wear between a s and m. i ordered a s in this due to the majority of reviews and found it to fit my shoulders well and length was fine. after reading the reviews i was so excited to get it but for me it actually made me look larger. there was too much material for me on the bottom and it actually made me look like i had a ""pooch""  never a good thing. i thought of returning for a m as i thought maybe it would have hung"
0,I loved the design of these pants  and got them to go with the matching jacket. the problem with them is there isn't enough stretch to keep them up. i found that thru out the day i was pulling them up  as they would slide down. the pant fabric should have had more stretch or they should have put stronger elastic at the waist.
-1,"Runs extremely large. i got an xs and am 5'4"" 115lbs and this would have fit someone who typically wears a size 10-14 and is 5'6"" and above. very disappointed with the size. the quality of the fabric wasn't great either. i wanted it to work so bad but just didn't!"
1,"I love the color  which is eye popping without being gaudy. i am 142lbs  5' 4"" and got size 4. it goes beautifully on my slightly brown skin. the length is just above the knee and the fold of the dress in the front adds that extra touch of oomph. it does have wide arm holes so a bra  even a strapless one  could be tricky  although it wasn't a gaping hole for me. i think i could wear it over a green bikini-like halter bra and take care of the arm issue."
0,I love this blouse on the model online. however  i couldn't get it to lay right and the material was a little scratchy for me. did not like the glittery thread.
-1,I tried this shirt at my local retailer and absolutely loved it ...until i read dry clean only!!!  really retailer? i know you can do better than that...
1,This dress is really lovely in person. the fit was perfect and the length not too short. for reference  i'm very busty at 38f and the dress actually fit! (i'm an xl usually  and the fit was tts) the only thing i'm not crazy about is the slip  it's more of a flesh toned color. i'll probably swap it out for a white one please make more like these  retailer!
-1,And not in a good way. everywhere i went  i left a little of this sweater behind. within hours of having it on  i was picking balls of fabric off the couch  bed  and the sweater itself looked like it was molting. great style  fabric and fit (although a little on the long side ) but there's no way i can keep it.
-1,I generally don't write bad reviews  but there is a real discrepancy between the quality of this kimono and the cost. the design and colors are great  but the fabric is ripping on all the kimonos on the rack in my store where the manufacturer's tag is at the back of the neck. the material is very thin  so there are other small holes beginning throughout the garment. i shop at retailer all the time  and this is not a $98 item of clothing.
-1,Looks great  the material feels great but when i put this dress on for the first time today it fell apart at the seams in the rib cage area. total disappointment! i had purchased this on sale for my graduation and was getting ready to walk out the door when i saw two holes on each side!
-1,I actually had no problem with the neck hole of this shirt  even with the xs size. however  i had a huge issue with the bottom eyelet section. it's so tight! it stretches across my thighs and looks so funny  as the top part is still loose. i tried moving up to a size small and still had this problem. maybe just not for girls with thighs ... very strange fit.
1,I wear between a l and xl..i chose the xl which was the right choice..if you are a bit curvy in proportions  i could size up. the color is gorgeous...i just logged back on to order another if there were options  but alas  there are not. flattering arm cut! could be worn for work  or with jeans/ out to dinner. it's cute  you won't regret it! (as a side note  it is sheer...which you can see in the photo. needs a cami)
0,I wanted to love this dress. i bought the cranberry color and it really is gorgeous. the cut was wrong for my body type. it is a bit roomier than expected. but i wear a size 36ddd so the seams on the chest hit at a very awkward spot. i'm sure it would look great on someone with a smaller chest
0,Cute dress...but akward fit. sleeves are a bit sung but the rest of the dress is a little large for its size.
0,This is really cute but does run large  if your in between sizes size down. the fabric at the front is super bulky but with a smaller size could be ok? it is so itchy  imo uncomfotably so! i would have returned for a smaller size had it not been so uncomfortable  ugh why! i loved the sleeves  very cute bell. and the back hung nicely. they need to make this in a cotton  vocoder and no wool! loved bit couldnt bear it.
1,This shirt feels so nice  it's heavier weight and so soft.. i think it's lyocel... such a great drape to the shirt that is so flattering. i am 5'8'' 128lbs and 34c/d and purchased a size 4. found this item to be true to size  if not slightly loose  but i love the flow of it. highly recommend  the green is classic and timeless  very versatile.
1,Don't detach the collar unless you like getting frustrated. i made the mistake of taking it off just to see what it looks like without it (cute) but reattaching was the biggest pain! i have pretty nimble fingers but stretching the little loops around the little buttons tested my patience to the limit. so other than that--buy this sweater if you get a chance. it's stylish  flattering  soft  versatile  etc  etc...
1,I love this jacket so much  i bought two. it goes with almost everything and is a nice weight for almost any weather. i recommend you grab it while it's on sale.
1,I bought this top to match a maxi skirt and it was pretty close to perfect.  i got the blue color   which is more of a brighter blue than a navy.  i'm 6ft and wear a 10 top  but got this in a large hoping to gain some length in the torso out of the of a large and could have gone a size down.  the top was definitely long enough and i didn't have the problems with the gaping at the hook that other reviewers had. this is probably because i went a little larger in the sizing and i have a very small
0,I want to like and keep. at this price point i cant justify keeping. if it does go to clearance i will reorder. due to the thin material it seems more summery and casual than what i was anticipating. true to size. i ordered a medium and am 5'9 and 155 pounds.
0,The print is unique and fun. however  the longer length and heavier weight of the fabric was not the piece i needed in my closet.
1,I adore this top! the tencel fabric feels like a nicely worn out denim shirt that's been worn for years. it is a versatile piece that can be worn year round.  even if the sleeves are pulled onto the shoulders   it still works and looks just fine. i'm broad in the shoulders  and we'll endowed   but the large was perfect.
1,Cute sweater! the side panels are perforated so you may want to wear either a nude bra or a cami underneath..
1,I love this sweater  it's so soft  and it seems to mold to my body more every time i wear it. it runs true to size  but i have noticed that as i wear it more and more  it seems to stretch a little. overall  i am very happy with it and would definitely recommend it!
0,Although the design and quality were great  this did not work for me. it was boxy  square and overwhelmed my petite frame. if you are taller  or have a longer torso  this may be a great basic staple for your wardrobe.
-1,I tried this dress on in a 6 and a 4 (a 4 is a little small for me but it looked so loose and flowy i thought sizing down would be a good idea). the 4 fit in the outer layer  however as the previous poster mentioned  the lining is super tight. i couldn't even pull the 4 lining down over my hips. the 6 was far too big in the shoulders and arms and still too tight in the lining. not sure what when wrong here but it's a shame because it's a really cute dress.
-1,I wanted to love this sweater. the color is gorgeous  the pattern unusual  it is soft and warm  and would have gone with so many things. but the cut is awful. mainly the sleeves are way too big  making me look misshapen and my arms look huge. the body was a bit boxy but that would have been workable if the arms had been normal. too bad.
-1,It is so cute in the picture but wasn't flattering on me. it also felt like i couldn't raise my arms while wearing it. i love retailer and will be a forever fan  but this dress just wasn't for me.
0,"This is a cute shirt  but it has slits at the bottom of the hem so that the front bottom of the shirt has this small rectangular ""flap."" it's not visible from the photo. i think it'll have to be returned for this reason."
1,I'm a 0/2 on top with 32d's and i purchased this top in a medium and it fit perfectly. pretty colors go with a mix of bottoms. design is both functional and attractive  which usually isn't the case with swimwear. love the underwire cups  adjustable ties and straps. and the fabric is really soft and comfortable.
-1,This whole order was disappointing. the main piece i ordered was cancelled and the two remaining items - this sweater included were poorly made. there was a snag/thread hanging out in the middle of the front of the sweater - tried to tuck it in but it wouldn't stay so i'll be returning it.
1,This jumpsuit has the best fit i could ever imagine for a jumpsuit. jumpsuits are always tricky for me  but this one fits like a dream. i would say it runs true to size  with the exception of being a little bit big in the chest. you could go braless with this jumpsuit as there are nice little cups for the girls  but i put on a strapless bra just to fill out the top part. that's not typically a problem for me being a 32d. i don't think i could size down though or it would be too tight in the wais
1,Absolutely stunning design with the eyelet lace top!  it's a very romantic  comfortable top that has a flattering fit. i'm so glad that it has lining so i don't need to be concerned about exposing myself to anyone.  it has a light fabric so it's very comfortable in the summer heat and humidity in florida.
0,Close but no cigar...  the design and color were cute.  the sweater itself was too warm for me  and itchy.  the top fit snugly in the chest and shoulders but it came out a little strangely at the bottom  it almost had strange fold in the front.  look closely at some of the photos and you'll see what i mean.  sadly it went back.
-1,Runs small. arms very short and hits in the wrong place across your chest. would not recommend.
-1,These run very small!! they are also short  almost like a crop pant. the fit was so weird that i won't even exchange for a bigger size.
0,I ordered these on sale despite a previous reviewer's comment that they were unflattering on the back side. they really do hug your bum  but that is not what bothers me. what bothers me is that the back side is totally see through  so unless you plan on wearing them with a long top  they are not wearable in public or around other people. i have gotten some of my favorite pieces from retailer  but also some of the most poorly designed. unfortunately  these fall in the latter category.
0,This top is really cute but shorter in length than expected.  plus  it shrunk considerably!
1,This is a heavier weight shirt. it is fitted through the bust and shoulders and very loose below so  if you don't like loose fitting clothes  this is not for you. it is well made and looks cute with jeans.
1,Love the lattice inserts  makes it feel like you have ventilation which is nice on a hot summer day. i purchased this in grey and in xs. i normally wear m for a looser fit  s for a more fitted look  so i was really surprised that an xs worked for me and was fitted. i haven't worn it since i washed it though. decided to buy the white but in a small  pretty but very see thru. will need to wear a shirt underneath  a little bummed because i liked the breeze! one other comment  this shirt is long! wh
-1,I was so bummed when this came in...the colors and print are beautiful  but the neck is super itchy because of an elastic/ruffle combo. there is also a liner which is a nice touch  but it's significantly shorter than the top layer which drove me nuts. definitely going back.
-1,I was expecting elbow-to-full-length sleeves and like a previous review noted  they were short. very weird look for a wrap. returned.
-1,I loved this shirt so much i bought it in 4 colors. however  two of them shrunk. i was very disappointed.
1,I ordered this in a large and its a super cute dress but this time the large ran super big! i usually wear a 10 so sometimes mediums are too small. i'm going to exchange it for a medium and see if that fits better. the beading detail is beautiful but just had too much fabric down below.
1,I ordered the ivory in size xl. it is such a cute  comfortable top. all of the details are well-done. the quality of the material is great too. it's a flowy fit. after washing & air-drying  it does shrink a bit. great tee for summer!
0,This skirt ran short  small  and boxy. if you can get the right fit  the skirt is great quality and super cute  but i recommend trying on in store for sizing.
1,This dress is absolute perfection. the quality of the dress is great  the fit is comfortable and it's such a fun summer dress. the slip underneath fits perfectly the outer layer is delicate yet durable.
0,Purchased the gray patterned top. seemed to fit tts  but it didn't fit me. i'm an athletic build with a 34d bust and it just wouldn't fit right around the shoulder/neck area. i'm pretty confident it would fit someone who is less busty than i. the double-sided fabric was soft and felt like it would wash/wear very well. nice length all around...top and sleeves.
-1,This top is so lovely  but runs soo big. i ordered it online and was so surprised when i tried it on at home. i'm normally a size 14  and i was positively swimming in this top. hoping to exchange for a petite sm.
1,I love the fabric  since it's fall wasn't expecting it to be light. but its not heavy either. just the right balance.  this is one of those classics. i love the collage like pattern of the fabric.  the fit is true to size and looks great with bootie/boots. (dressed up or down).
-1,This jacket looked adorable on. it was also quite comfortable. however  it sheds and left fuzz on every dark surface it touched. sadly  this is a deal breaker for me.
-1,This top looked so cute in the picture  but unfortunately doesn't live up to it! the one i received  actually has the print shown in the photo on the inside of the shirt. it makes it much darker  and boring. the shirt itself is on the short side  and would've looked better if it hit lower on the hips  there's just too much fabric for it to land higher than that.
-1,"So i bought this  even after seeing the other reviews. because i love the designer and their things are normally cute and different. this fits just as others describe. it was not flattering to me at all  5""2. had to go back."
0,Bought this shirt in mid-july  washed twice (cold  delicate) and hung to dry. already holes/falling apart
1,I purchased this shirt in black. luckily  it was on sell. it can be dressed up or dressed down. it's so easy to just throw this on with skinny pants or jeans. i got it on sale too. i just hope that i can keep it for years since it will always be in style.
0,I got this top in my typical size medium and wanted to love it...it is such a good idea and i loved it on the model! however  it failed in translation for me  and i will be returning. the bottom of the top is very loose  but the top clings to my chest (36dd)  pulling awkwardly and gapping on the sides. not worth exchanging for a large  since the bottom of the top is already to loose..
1,I love the fabric  texture mix and length of this top. i gave it a four stars because my usual size is a medium but had to go with a large. a medium felt a bit too snug through the shoulders. very happy with this top and look forward to wearing it a lot.
-1,I was very excited about ordering this top as i'm tall girl (6 ft) and i like my back well covered. i liked both style and design of the top on photo but when the package arrived i was very disappointed with the material. this top is incredibly thin and see through. though fabric is nice and soft  it feels more like a pajama top. all curves & bumps immediately stand out and it doesn't look flattering. i ordered 2 colors grey and black size large and returned both  although they were true to size
1,I'm always scared of rompers because of my height and long legs. but this one was perfect. it didn't ride up or hit in a weird spot on the hips. it's very flattering.
-1,I was excited to see this top  ordered it and was disappointed. it was too tight across the chest and had too much fabric around the bottom. i tried this on 3 times hoping for i had been wrong in previous assessments- no luck.
1,I've been looking for dresses to wear to nurse in since i just had a baby & so i bought this dress knowing it just had a tack holding the front fold together & always intending to remove the tack. i love it. the fabric is super soft. i wear it with a nursing tank underneath and a wide belt to cinch my waist & it's amazing. with the tack in  it did pull very strangely across the bust as others have mentioned  so it's not good for a big bust unless you intend to remove the tack & wear something un
-1,This dress is very thick cotton material. like a sweatshirt. i was hoping to wear this to a wedding but it is a tunic at best. the bell part of the sleeves also stick out awkwardly because of the fabric.
-1,I bought these a great alternative to black jeans but they are headed back.  the texture is nice but let's call them what they are- thin  leggings.  not worth the price in my opinion.  honestly  i can't seem to find a pair of pilcros that i like so i'd spent the extra money on a better pair of black jeans.
-1,I saw this sweater online and have been looking for a unique sleevless sweater for some time now. its a very beautiful sweater so i ordered it right away when i saw this design. i recieved the sweater in the mail and really wanted to love it but it just wasn't for me. its very well made and thick which i liked but i usually fit in small sized tops for retailer but they didn't have a small left in the sizes  i ordered a medium and it still ran small  i was very surprised. its was also disappointing
0,This model looks like a bauble head. she is absolutely too thin and sends the wrong message out to retailer shoppers. this last catalog's models are anorexic and unhealthy looking.    i ordered this shirt hoping it would fit  but it's too small for 34dd. i am tall athletic and have breasts.   i think of my shape as average - and the top didn't fit. it's cut narrow and small.
0,"I bought the rose and the sapphire during the xtr 40% off clearance. i'm just under 5'4""  curvy & usually wear med petite in retailer dresses. i ordered a mr because  being sale items  only regular sizing was available. a sp would have been much better! the dress hit about 3"" below my knee and the crisscross top made my bust look matronly. a snugger fit would have been sexier. the rose was darker than pictured & pretty  but eh on me. however  the sapphire was gorgeous. i'm sad about returning it."
-1,I bought a pair of these in stone and after the first wash they become all splotchy. i chalked it up to perhaps there was bleach leftover in the my washer. although nothing else in the load was blotchy. i then  because i loved the cut of these pants  bought another pair in the darker blue color. the same thing happened after the first wash. again  nothing else in that wash load was the least bit ruined -- just my new retailer pants! such a bummer-- definitely a dye issue. i called the stores i pur
1,Just bought this weekend and had to size down. i'm usually a small in jackets and went with the xs. retailer has had this style for the last few years and i've missed out so finally was able to buy before they sold out!! well worth the price point. i think it will be a very versatile jacket. for sizing reference i'm 5'7 and 135lbs.
0,I got this dress in hopes of having a really nice winter formal dress. it was not well made at all! the lining didn't line up with the top layer and the waist puffed out in uneven places. i am curvy so a puffy waistline in the last thing i need! the fabric itself is very nice  but just not well made. i do not recommend this dress.
1,"I saw this online and said to myself  next time you are in the retailer store look for this dress. i am glad i did! i bought the neutral dress (off white tan.black) because i knew it would go with everything and most occasions. i am 5'6""  136 pounds  the small fit me perfect! in retailer dresses i am between a small/med. the top of the dress is lined and form fitting which is a plus. the off white coored section does go across the chest so one must wear a neutral colored lined bra even though the to"
-1,This tank (in black) is nice quality  most of the fringe hangs straight and seems to be attached well. it's just too short and too boxy for my figure (curvy/hips). would look good on someone who has straight hips and is not long waisted. since that doesn't describe me  it has to go back.
0,While i love the green color and the soft waffle knit of this top it was so wide i could have fit two of me standing side by side into it!  i mean it was truly laughable!  don't know what the manufacturer was thinking but this one needs to go back to the drawing board.
0,I wanted to love it - the color is great  the embroidery pretty  but the stiff scalloped sleeves were just too much. if you have broad shoulders this is not the shirt for you. i think personally it would have been better had the material been softer.
1,"I was expecting to love this based on the reviews and my prior experience with this brand  but i'm a little unsure. the front part hangs a bit too low on my 5'4"" frame  yet i think a petite would have the slits too high on the sides. i'm just not sure it hangs right on me. it's fitted through the arms and shoulders nicely  and looks great with the front loosely tucked. just not what i was expecting."
0,Would have loved this skirt  but the xl is closer to a size 12 than a 14 or 16. larger ladies beware!
0,Love this top   although it ran very small in bust and arms   i'm normally a medium will have to return for a large!
-1,"I didn't receive a jacket. i received a very expensive cardigan sweater with no structural qualities to it. jackets have some structure to them. for example they might nip in at the waist a bit. this cardigan doesn't do that. it hangs in a very boxy shape. the quality is great. very light weight and i really love the little pockets and details  but i don't need/want another cardigan.     i'm 5'5""  118 lbs and got a small. the small seemed big  but i think it would have fit fine if it had more st"
1,"The attention to detail in aligning the pattern is excellent as always with this brand.  .  i tried a size 2 and it fit fine  just above my long waist ( 5'2""  currently 33-25-37.5 with narrow hips and fuller thighs). i have several other cartonnier shorts in sizes 0 and 2  depending on my weight  and these fit similarly. i think the size 2 petite would be a bit lower but it's sold out now.  .  the only reason i passed was that the fabric has a polyester fusible interfacing so that it keeps its s"
-1,This dress comes with a built in fupa. literally there is extra material at the lower abdomen that sticks out and is very unflattering.
-1,I was drawn to this top because of the interesting and detailed straps  which are embroidered with a lovely triangle pattern. however the embroidery takes away any stretchy-ness or give in the cotton and makes the top a beautiful but ill-fitting harness for anyone with any breasts or full-figured lusciousness. the worst part is that the top hem along the top is embroidered and rigid just like the straps  so it feels like you are wearing an uncomfortable strapless top. i wanted to keep this but h
0,"I love this dress  i mean it si really pretty in person  however  the breast area is just too small... i can't wear a bra with it  and my ""older"" breasts just droop  not flattering. they are barely covered... i am a bit disappointed at that  but if you are smaller up there  i say give it a try... i am 115 lbs  26.5 ion waist  30dd and xs petite was great everywhere but chest.    colors and fabric are great  i love that the different colors are different types of fabric... too bad."
0,These pants are adorable as pajamas or maybe something very casual to wear to the beach  but they honestly do not seem like something that a grown woman would wear in public. they are good quality and fit nicely  but i feel like if you're over 20  they're not really flattering or especially appropriate.
1,I ordered this top in xs and blue  its subtle but pretty on  as the style gives it a boost. it is a bit snug in the shoulders (cut a little snug in armpit?) but i would not want it larger. it does not affect the appearance  is not uncomfortable  just noticeable when moving arms around. nice fall top  want to try with blue or white jeans and boots.
-1,Oh how i love moth sweaters but wow was this one a disappointment. the color is wonderful  the shape is unique and the stitch work is lovely but that's where the compliments end. it's an itchy  cheap feeling acrylic that is too short for my torso. i am truly disappointed that at this price point it was such a cheap feeling piece. so bummed. so so bummed.
1,This is a wonderful vest! i love the lining!! keeps you nice and warm! i love the muted green color! the pockets are sewn closed but can be cut open at the stitching without ruining the vest!!
0,I loved this dress and after i got it on. as others mentioned  it is difficult to get it on. i wish that the bow snapped on and off. as i took the dress off the bow came off itself. unfortunately going to be returning the dress.
1,I was immediately drawn to this top in the catalog. when my local retailer had it in stock and in my size  i tried it on. it fit so well - the front wasn't too low and the back was fantastic with its multiple straps. i wore it the same week to a dinner with friends. i like the multiple prints and the navy blue edging. i bought the turquoise necklace too because it topped off the look so well. the fabric is silky but washable. the top is very well made and fun to wear.
0,This lift weight cardigan is true to size  perfect for fall or spring. colors are quite nice  especially the little pops of orange.
-1,Why is it so difficult to find a shirt that doesn't expose half of my bra if i lift my arm?     this is cute (beyond the arm hole issue) but overpriced. going back.
1,I love the style and quality of this blouse. it can easily be dressed up or down. the blouse is completely see through and delicate. still  it is so romantic  feminine  distinctive and timeless.
-1,The sides scooped up a bit too much on me. i was hoping to be able to tuck this into a skirt and wear to work  but there were definitely some gaps that showed the side of my midriff. back it goes. :(
1,Paige jeans are obviously known for their luxurious feel and amazing fit. these jeans are the best new addition to your collection. the perfect high rise and not as extreme flair  these might beat out your skinny jeans for your nights out. they do come extremely long  so they will most likely need to be hemmed. i get huge compliements when i wear them and told how they compliement my legs in the best way. if you're debating on whether to jump onto the flair trend  i'd go with these!
1,I tried on the grey motif yesterday  and it was the one thing i tried on that i loved  and the only thing i bought. i'm 5'4 34 dd 125 lbs  and the xs was a perfect fit for me. i sometimes find that retailer stuff is tight in the arms  so i generally wear a small  but i tried on the small  and the arms were a bit baggy. i plan on wearing tanks underneath  so the xs was the right call. if you want to wear something thicker & long sleeved underneath  go with your usual size.
0,The design of these is adorable with the lace up ties however they are a dingy looking off white color. they are also pretty see through. returned.
0,"I do not love these pants. while the fabric is nice  they make me look rather dumpy. i highly recommend the essential taper pant instead  which has beautiful tapering legs and made me look more slender. these pants make me look like i've put on 20 pounds and they also make me look rather squat. perhaps they would look good on someone tall  but at 5' 6"" these are a miss for me!"
1,Love these! loose and comfy everywhere. delighted to have found a 32  and delighted that they are roomy  even at the waist. i exchanged another pair of pilcro's and was afraid of a shipping/pricing conflict  but as usual  retailer customer service was excellent. earlier sale price was honored  easy returns in the orignal shipping bag..   retailer design  fashion and company attitude excels!
0,Strange fit if you have a short torso. i ordered a medium petite and the drop waist looked strange  so i tried using a belt and it bunched up. returned the dress. why should a nice simple dress like this create such hard work?!
0,I wanted to give this a glowing review but i ended up returning this cardigen. the folds on top added too much to my frame. i do not suggest this for heavier apple shapes. for all others  it is incredibly soft and warm. the tan color was weird but they others are simply gorgeous.
-1,"Absolutely loved this top but after i washed it the underside color ran at the stitching. it is all white on the outside but at the bottom hem it has a really cool 1"" lining in a mustard color. i did a cold water wash and flat to dry. i noticed around the stitching at the bottom the mustard color has bled through just at the area of the mustard color stitching.     i am so disappointed b/c i loved this top."
0,I bought the stained glass top/bottoms. the print is very pretty. however  the tankini top itself is not well-made. the front of it (chest area) turns out so that you can see part of the inside of the suit (which is white). it doesn't lay flat around the top  and so it shows more of your chest on one side. for the price  i don't think it is worth it. i don't like to wear it because it makes me feel uncomfortable.
1,I have three pairs of these in different colors (one pair is striped) and i love them. they are flattering and comfy. they go with nearly everything. can't get enough!!!!!
0,"I loved the color and lines of this jumpsuit  but found it to be far too short in the torso. (and about 8"" too long in the leg  but that's a lot easier to fix.) i tried sizing up  but it still wasn't working for me. i'm only 5'7""  and while i'm long-waisted i can usually make jumpsuits work. if you have a short torso and long legs  this is a beautiful option. otherwise  i can't recommend it."
0,It's a beautiful sweater but it is very wide (much wider than it looks on the model)  even in the xs/s. it is also fairly itchy. just way too big for my small frame  which is not really the look i was going for.
1,These chinos fit great! they are extremely comfortable and true to size but note that they do loosen up quite a bit with wear. i bought all 3 colors!
0,I absolutely loved this dress  the style is flattering and the mix of fabrics and lace make it truly feminine and unique. the only problem is the bust runs really small. i normally wear a 4-6 in retailer but i ordered a 6 and and 8 and both were way to tight in the bust. very disappointed because i really wanted to keep this dress.
0,This sweater is very pretty  i love the knit and the cream color. for some reason it just didn't flow the way i wanted it to  and i didn't love the v neck. just didn't pull me in completely!
-1,Such a cute pattern  and i loved the fold-over design  but beware - there is not enough bottom coverage! i should've looked more closely at the photo - it's pretty accurate in showing the bathing suit bottoms have limited rear coverage. a couple more inches of fabric would've really helped. i'm used to fuller coverage bathing suit bottoms  and these just expose way more cheek than i felt comfortable with. i could maybe wear them around my husband  but definitely not my dad! i felt like if i bent
0,Cute pattern  but the shirt is very thin and runs small and short!
0,I had to return this because the lining is super short and uneven. its shorter in the back and falls weird. i love the color even better than the picture. but quality is lacking for this high price. i ordered the 4 petite and it fit but the elastic waist shows any bump in your tummy too. bummer
1,I love this shirt so much i came back and bought it in black (i originally got the lavender color). it is super easy to wear and has a delicate quality to it (though i washed it on a regular cycle and it's holding up well!). as you can see from the photos  because of the wrap style  the middle of the front is shorter than the rest of the shirt. i've worn this top with regular rise jeans and haven't had a problem  though if you lift your arms  your belly may show. i purchased my usual size small
1,Love this color! when i saw this beautiful blue color in the store i had to try them on! so pretty! if you love pilcro chinos--you will be happy with these! same great fit and an awesome color!
-1,I had to return this blouse because it ended up been too small and super itchy. im kind of busty but medium usually works and this one was super tight across my chest. not comfortable at all and the fabric is kind of a sheer with the sparkly lines in silver. wouldn't recommend it.
-1,The dress arrived with a few snags and the fabric already pilling. the fabric will only get worse with wear. return. cute concept; poor fabric quality.
-1,The fabric felt cheap and i didn't find it to be a flattering top. for reference i am wearing a medium in the photos and my measurements are 38-30-40.
1,I love this vest and could not leave without it. the color and lining just make it perfect  so stylish and comfy! i'm always a 8/10 and a m in this was perfect. the color is so beautiful and its so easy to dress up and down. i am big on the bottom  the tie in the back adds a nice shape to your whole profile and makes it a less boxy vest! love love...
1,I love this dress because it's so comfortable and has this hippie peasant vibe that i don't generally wear. plus it's a three season dress with pockets! bought the medium but i should have sized down to a small. on top i'm a m/l girl and the medium is huge. i'm not going to exchange since i wear a sweater over it right now. this dress looks good with or without a belt  with long boots  booties and sandals. so happy with this purchase!
0,I agree with the other reviewer  this is a nice piece. i felt so-so about it when i tried it on though. see below.    ___________  pros:  - not too heavy or warm due to being part linen/cotton blend  making it breathable and great for more milder temperatures.  - soft floral arrangements with lovely pattern throughout the sweater.  - lovely collar giving it a sophisticated feel.  - ran tts. i'm 5'9  hourglass with some meat on my bones and found the medium to be an ideal fit.  ___________  cons:
1,"This top is simple but beautiful. i am either a large or xl but purchased this in the xl. it is a swing top  but has a beautiful flow to it which is not overbearing. i am around 5'6"" and slightly on the broad side and do not feel overpowered by this shirt at all.  i love a top that can be worn everyday with a pair of jeans or dressed up with a pair of slacks. the plus to this top is that it can born worn almost year round which i like.  a great staple for your closet."
0,I love the look of this top. i'm usually a size 12 or 14 and i tried on a size l and it seemed really big  and looked a little like a maternity top. i thought maybe it was too big and ordered a size m. unfortunately  it still looked maternity-ish. i think the bottom of this is flared so much that if you have a big bust at all  it will look like a maternity top on you.
-1,This reminded me of big bird in person and just adds volume to your body. i'm thin and usually wear a size 0  so i'm not sure who this may look good on.
1,"I can't wait for our warmer weather to arrive here in minnesota so i can wear this lovely tank top. the style is so flattering  it doesn't bag out to make you look pregnant. the back yoke is solid navy blue chiffon which is a nice touch. soft fabric  drapes beautifully. the armholes are not oversized. the fabric is opaque so no camisole required.    i am 5'5"" and 120 lbs. and 36a. i purchased size small."
-1,I was so excited to buy this coat  since i missed out on buying the last one. i snagged it quickly before heading out on a trip because this is the perfect plane jacket (i've borrowed my friends). i immediately noticed that the fabric was lighter and softer than the original  and after a few days noticed a lot of pilling on the coat  and a snag on the seam of the shoulder where the arm connects to the body. it's disappointing considering the price you pay. i would return if it still had tags on.
-1,I wanted to love this sweater and it has some nice distinctive features that make it more interesting than your average cardigan. unfortunately  however  i found that flared in an unflattering manner over my stomach. the chest fit well - though it was very low cut - but then if i buttoned the sweater it made me look like at least three sizes larger.  the quality seemed okay  but a bit thin and i was afraid that this would not hold up for long.
-1,Beautifully made shirt however the sizing is way off. the sleeves and across the chest are really tight while the rest of the shirt fits fine. if you get a size larger then the shirt in the body is to large. would recommend if you have really tiny shoulders  arms and chest. such a shame since i really love the shirt.
0,I ordered this shirt in the purple stripe and was happy when it arrived and i really liked the color and style.   however  like the other reviewer  when i tried it on  the little circles on the front line up perfectly with your bra straps.  i even tried a different style bra and had the same result.  sadly i returned it yesterday.
1,This top fits exactly like the last photo  which was my hope. it is not as slim as the other images. it's a swing top and the arm holes are perfect size  and the mock turtleneck is not too high. the fabric is thick  so will be perfect transitioning from summer to fall.
-1,This dress has a great shape and fabric - but the v neckline is too deep/low and the arm holes are also cut too low. would loved to have been able to keep it but had to return.
1,I have featured a picture below. i'm 5 feet 120 lbs. i ordered an xs petite. i'm pretty busty so i don't like a loose fitting top  so ordering a size down did the trick. it's super soft  one of a kind and the edging of the neckline is delicate looking and soft and therefore adds a feminine element. i'm enjoying wearing the top.
0,Adorable suit  super cute print and great quality  but unfortunately not as flattering as other reviewers noted. i found that the white pattern accentuated the wrong areas and the ruffle feature was a bit over-the-top. the straps are also very thin and didn't offer too much support.
1,"I saw these on the freshly cut + promo discount & decided to order my usual size 28 reg in pilcro. a great fit & appreciate the midrise. not too snug or baggy. look pretty much on me as in the model pic except they fall abt 1"" below my ankles. i am only 5'3"" so not a surprise they are a little longer on me but it's really ok. fyi - the front button & back pocket tacks are gold which gives a classy look to these jeans. just love.. & love the price too! 5'3""  117#"
-1,Fits large  wrinkles easily and not what i expected for the price.
1,I bought this in size xl and it initially fit me similarly to the model. but  once i washed it (in cold in my machine  reshaped and air-dried)  it was so much smaller/shorter. i loved the embroidery on the top. the mix of pattern colors is great too. i like when blues and blacks are mixed together. i don't know how i could have prevented the shrinking. i now throw on a shrug or jacket over to hide the shorter length. still stylish and fun.
-1,The design is gorgeous  the fit is great and the fabric drapes beautifully and is very comfortable. however  it's extremely see thru.
-1,I ordered a small and the top part was huge yet the bottom a little snug. you need a big chest and small legs and bottom. too bad. it's very cute.
-1,"Wanted to love this sweater for its beautiful colors and cute graphic  but the fit is uncomfortably small and it is so itchy i was yelling  ""get it off"" in the fitting room. bummer."
0,I sized down one size and it's still too big with the double v-neck style. this is going back.
-1,I wish i had read all the reviews before purchasing. the sweater looked liked everything i would be interested in online. once i pulled it out of the bag  my first thought was how could retailer send me a used  washed and shrunken sweater. it is nothing like the picture. it fits like a midriff top  not exaggerating. i'm 5.6  ordered the m  don't waste your shipping money on this.
-1,I thought the sweater itself was beautiful  but found the fabric to be stiff and itchy.
1,I bought this blouse after i saw my aunt wearing it. the color is lovely. i spilled soup on it during my first wearing and it laundered wonderfully. i am so glad! such an easy piece to throw on  very comfortable. fit is great.
0,This top is gorgeous in both detail in color. it fit great and true to size  but then i hand washed it as instructed on the label and it shrank substantially to the point that it's now too short and needs to be returned.
1,I love this jacket - can dress it up or dress it down. over a dress  skirt or jeans. very soft and flattering!
-1,There were just too many pleats to this thing. it was not flattering. it looks fantastic on this model but not on me. oh well.
0,This is a beautiful dress. i sized up 2 sizes based on other reviews and it fits well. it is on the shorter side. i purchased the blue and it's a beautiful color. i was in love with the dress until the zipper burst open after wearing it for five minutes. i think i'm going to have the zipper replaced because i like it so much. but at the high price point there should be a functional zipper.
0,I wear a 32 and sometimes a 31 but i could barely squeeze these on in a 32. the fabric is thick with lots of stretch but these are super skinny all the way to the ankle like a legging and not a jean. made for much thinner frames than mine.
1,I love the print on this. love. and the fit  for a swing blouse  was super flattering! typically i haven't found that to be true  but this one is so nice! i loved it so much  but i just couldn't find a ton of outfits to wear with such a unique piece. i have been trying to slim my closet so i did return this  but perhaps would purchase it on sale (to justify wearing it less). i typically wear a 4 in tops and dresses and took an xs.
1,I bought this top to add some more color and pattern to my summer wardrobe. it is really cute and a flattering cut. i just had a baby  so it's perfect for showing some curves without clinging. if anything  i'd say it maximizes my bustline more than i expected  but is still very flattering. i think i'm still getting used to my new bustline ;) soft  comfy fabric. not too hot. i get compliments when i wear it!
-1,Poor quality  material looks much thinner and cheaper than pictured.
-1,Sometimes i order things online that i can hardly wait to arrive  and then once they do  i wonder if i made a mistake when ordering it. this is one of those times  and it was not my mistake. the shirt i received is not like this one. it is an xs  but it is quite large falling inches below where this one hits on the model. everyone i have shown the shirt to says that it is a denim blue color  not grey at all. it is a pretty color  but not what i thought i was ordering. i hate it when this happens
1,I saw this dress online this morning  went into a store this afternoon and walked out with it! i love this brand because the designs are modest  but feminine and practical. this dress is made of a thicker study cotton with beautiful all over embroidery. the fit is tts  and you can adjust the waist to fit loose or a bit more snug. the length is just above my knee at 5'3. i plan to wear this now with black boots and a furry vest  and later by itself with sandals and big sunnies!
-1,I was looking for an oversized silhouette but this is more like a beach cover-up. the waist does not have elastic or any structure. the top fabric is crossed over but not sewn closed  and because the fit is so loose it just gaps open. the fabric is nice quality but i am returning.
-1,Really cute piece  but it's huge. i ordered an xxs petite and it was unfortunately extremely wide and not flattering. returning.
0,I was disappointed with this jumpsuit. when i first saw it in the store  i thought i was going to love it. when i tried it on  the first issue is the fabric is too sheer. i could completely see the outline of my underwear and bra. it also runs way too big! i know the bottom is supposed to be loose and flowy  but the waist needs to be more tapered to off set that  and it's so baggy. the arm holes are also cut very low  so when you lift your arms you can see most of your bra on the sides   i wante
0,"I fell in love with this dress in the store and have been so excited to receive my size in the mail  but the proportions are all off! even the petite size is too long in the torso  and the regular is laughable for anyone that isn't an amazon princess. and i'm not even that short (5'4"")!  curvy ladies  also keep in mind that though the rest of the dress stretches nicely  the grosgrain ribbon detailing in the midsection does not  and will cut into any extra flesh hiding out on those hips. i would"
1,Bought these online - sale  and am really happy with them. soft and light material - feel breezy  like a beach pant should!
-1,The button fell off when i took it out of the bag  and i noticed that all of the thread had unraveled. will be returning :-(
1,"Loved it on the hanger and when i tried it on. it's a gorgeous shade of blue (denim  not navy) with some light tie-dye streaking along the top and sides which add interest. the ""bat wing"" feature is a little limiting; i won't be able to reach anything high without the whole top coming up with me. as for the material  it's an interesting blend bc it isn't soft or rough. some may say it's itchy and some may say it's soft  to me it isn't either. it's merely smooth enough. which sounds terrible  ""it"
0,I fell in love with the shirt when i saw it online; but  i was incredibly disappointed with it when it was delivered.  on the positive side  the macrame is stunning.  once again  there was way too much fabric which makes me look pregnant.  most importantly  the color is not peach!  it's almost a burnt indian red or brick red/orange.  it was a disgusting color.
1,"Love the color  fit and feel of these jeans.  the thin material is stretchy and comfortable. i didn't have to pull them up every so often during a 3 hour party.  they didn't bag out after the first wearing and are true to size.  i got a 27p (5'2""  115#).  the leg length is perfect and ends at the ankle.  the rise wasn't too low for me.  highly recommend!"
0,The top falls nicely  great quality  the lace is beautiful. however  the sleeves are too wide and puffy. the top is voluminous and i wished it had more form fitting sleeves to balance this out. the top does not look flattering on me so i will be returning it.
-1,When i tried these on in the store i was thrilled - they were comfy as yoga pants and  the fit was divine. i thought i had found the perfect jeans and i splurged on them for my birthday. after wearing just two times they are baggy and the knees are totally bagged out  saggy and faded.  so disappointing - i want my $180 back!
1,"I loved this top  and i normally order petites when i'm able to  but this wasn't offered in a petite size so i took a chance and ordered it in regular. just got it in the mail and when i pulled it out i thought wow  it is a petite! but its not  just runs small. i got the xs size and it was tight under the arms  and the peplum bottom came up a bit high and felt slightly maternity-ish the way the bottom part flared out. i actually thought it was a bit too short too  even on me (5'2""  about 118 lbs"
-1,Beautiful dress but have to return. way too big & long for me. medium is the size i wear but i think i would need an extra small.
1,I saw this duster and immediately ordered it in cream. i have worn it every chance i get. it goes well with dresses as well as shorts or jeans. the length is perfect  the design is flattering  and the material is soft and comfortable. the sleeves are snug- but i like this feature  especially for light weight summer use over a tank top or sleeveless blouse. this will be a go to item. thanks retailer- another gem!
1,Just beautiful dress! it dits perfectly  tts and i feel like princess in it! highly recommend girls!
0,I loved these when i first got them. they fit perfectly and are the softest and most comfortable pair of cords i've ever owned. plus ag is the only brand of jeans i buy. unfortunately  they stretch out horribly within one wearing. for such a pricey pair of cords  i'm extremely disappointed. i'm not sure if i should've sized down  but now i'm wishing i had  although i'm not sure that would make a difference.
0,There is a lot of fabric here! the legs fit me fine  but they are long and when you roll them up it creates a bunching of fabric in an awkward area. i've also found that they don't stay rolled up in the back  especially if you sit down. it's a shame since the fabric is soft and comfortable. maybe sizing down would've helped  but i doubt that would've fixed the problem of the cuffs staying rolled up.
1,I wish it was a little bigger.i kept this for it will be wonderful for summer.
0,Sadly  i returned this one. i'm a 36d bra size and this shirt could not handle that. it fit around my chest  so sizing up was not necessary  but my chest caused the straps to shift and sit funny on my shoulders. cute top and well made for those who can fit into it better!
0,These are so cute and the colors are great  however  they stretch out about 2 sizes. they fit me perfectly and i sized down and they stretched out about a size 1/2 to 2 sizes too big. i'm bummed out because they are perfect in every other way. didn't think they would stretch out as much as they did. and they look awful once  they've stretched out. wish i didn't take the tags off or i would have returned them. size down at  least one size  i could have sized down two sizes. hoping they shrink lik
-1,This is a great dress if you don't want to leave the house or you want the world to see your nipples.
0,This dress is beautiful as pictured on the model. but on me  not so much. i am normally a size 0/00 with a 32b bra size. i ordered this dress in an xs and it was just too big and boxy. i also thought the material was going to be thicker  but it was very thin and didn't seem to fall right on my body. beautiful design  just not the right material or fit.
1,My favorite pants! they do run slightly large so i sized down. i have 3 colors and will continue to add more!
1,"I saw this vest the week it came in the store. i was hesitant  thinking  ""what do i have to go with this?"" i left the store and had to go back and purchase it. i'm so happy i did! it really does go well simple tops (dressy or casual). it is also perfect for the ""winter white"" trend happening this year!"
0,This top has too much fabric! i would of liked it more if they had a smaller size but the small seemed like a medium or large!
1,"Bought both colors - nice quality top  but they do run large. for reference  i'm 5'4""  115lbs and xs is still kind of big on me. wish they have xxs."
0,I love the style of this top. i just wish there were a slimmer version of it. unfortunately  this top doesn't suit my long  slim midsection. it is so wide  it completely hides the waist. i think it would look adorable on a different body type.
-1,This sweater looked so promising with the tie waist and pretty lacy edging  but turned out to be a disappointment. it was much shorter than it looks in the photos and barely came to my hips. and the plum color was much darker than i expected  more of a dull brownish-burgundy.
0,I wish his dress would have worked. it is beautiful!! however  the waist and bust runs very small. the bottom of the dress does flare out a bit but the waist is so tight that unless you are a stick  everything at your waist and hips will stick out.
-1,I was so excited when i purchased this top! it was going to be my go to for running around  as it looked super cute with leggings and boots! the softness alone made me feel like i was wearing my pajamas.....so comfy! that all changed after one washing......it is now pilling and not nearly as soft as before! makes me sad  but it is going back!
0,"I'm still on the fence with this shirt. i have the grey - it almost looks like a cheetah design up close. i'm 5'3"""
0,This dress is well made and of good quality it just looked a little too old on me. the skirt was heavy and the fabric was cozy  perfect for a fall outfit.
1,Overall i really like this dress. the color is vibrant & unique. the top of the dress especially the shoulder straps seem loose so i'm getting it tailored.
1,I love the oversized look of this jacket--my building is kept freezing cold so while at work i am constantly fiddling with cardigans and scarves and a space heater to try to keep from freezing while working and i thought this jacket would be a great jacket that basically functions as a blanket while still looking professional. (my boyfriend doesn't quite get the 3/4-length sleeves but that definitely keeps the look of this jacket polished--if they were longer i think it would be too much just li
0,I love these leggings - they look and feel great  but i can't wear them out of the house! there is no elastic in the waistband  so they are constantly falling down. i won't dare wear them out  for fear they will fall down when i walk across the street. everything else about the leggings is exactly what i was looking for: style  comfort  and warmth. they are great for curling up to read a good book in front of the fire; not for doing anything active.
-1,"The color says red but it's more like a rust. i'm 5'3"" so it was long and would need to be tailored and the fabric is so thin i was afraid it would rip if it got caught on anything.    finally returned it without it making it out the door :("
-1,This skirt fits in a strange way. there is one pleated area but it is on the side so it is not flattering and i kept feeling as if i wanted to straighten the skirt.. the elastic looks frumpy. unflattering.
0,I wanted to love this dress. i went into retailer in sb to try it on and when i saw it on the rack it looked beautiful  both the print and the material. then i tried it on and it fit like a tent. i am just under 5'5 and it hit right below my knees  not like shown in the picture here. on that note  i passed on this one due to the fit. i think this would make a fantastic maternity dress though.
0,I really wanted to like this  but like other reviews say  the knit fabric pills easily and i don't think the tank feels or looks as good as it would were it cotton. a good deal on sale  but i don't think it will hold up very long. i got the teal/white  as black/white and coral/navy were sold out.
-1,I ordered a medium in this and it definitely fits more like a large. i liked the color & the sleeves  but tying the tie at the neck looks silly on me and leaving it open shows too much cleavage. overall  it is just shapeless and too much fabric on me. i'm sending this one back.
1,The color is deep coral and perfect for fall to top jeans or leggings. i love the big slouchy look so the drapey quality is a plus.
1,I got the top in green  it is very soft and comfy. it does flare out a little if you wear it untucked but looks really cute tucked into jeans or a skirt.
-1,This looks great on the model but when it arrived  i couldn't believe it was the same jacket. it looks a bit like a really loose garbage bag on me and no amount of adjusting drawstrings is going to fix it. i really wanted to like it  but even the xs/s was too baggy. also a bit worried based on other reviews that it isn't actually a rain jacket and wont keep you dry.
-1,Totally see through.
0,This shirt is so cute in the picture but not so great in person. i bought the short sleeve version this summer and loved it! this runs really big so maybe a smaller size will help.
-1,Not a tunic unless the model pictured is 5'1. barely covered my backside and not as advertised. design on top is interesting and the fabric is soft so it's a good buy if 50% off or more.
-1,These jeans are adorable! i'm so sad they didn't fit. my legs are bigger than the rest of my body  but i usually have good luck with wide leg pants. if you are looking for wide legs  these are not the jeans for you!
-1,I loved the shirt until i washed it! awful fabric quality. cheaply made.
0,This is soooo much more cropped than it looks in the picture. the fabric is super soft and design is cute. i really wanted to like this  but it just doesn't fit as shown. the back is halfway up by back and i am shortwaisted...
1,I love this jacket and have worn it to work with a deep chocolate brown t-neck and straight leg pants. i get a lot of compliments on it. i am happy that the double breasting does not bulk up my silouette as that can happen with the style. the boiled wool is fine quality without being thick. the color is true to what is shown. the fit is perfect and what i expected. i highly recommend the purchase.
0,Couldn't wait for this sweater to arrive. i love oversized sweaters for the fall! unfortunately this sweater is extremely itchy that it has to be returned :(
1,I recommend this product if you are tall. the pants fit great but they are too long. im 5'7' and they drag on the ground.
0,"I tried on the grey version in store  and it was significantly longer than pictured. the back came down to just below my knee  which looked awkward with the split sides. i am 5'4"" and this was a regular (not petite) size. however  the overall quality of the fabric was good and it seemed durable."
1,Purchased this for new years eve and an early january wedding. can't say enough good things about it! the lace fabric is soft with the perfect weight. the style is slimming and flattering. although i am short  i have a full bustline and ordered regular rather than petite and it fits perfectly. pants are very easy to hem if needed. needs very little by way of accessories because the lace edging is so beautiful.4 seasons appropriate!
-1,I love these pants. bought them in both black and burgundy. but the burgundy pair split in the butt before i even made it to work in the morning. they weren't even tight. so disappointing. i will be returning them.
1,"One of the more beautiful pieces retailer hags carried in a long time. i instantly fell in love the second i took it out of the box. the only problem is that it runs short in the torso. i ordered the xs and it fit perfectly everywhere except it gave me a wedgie. for reference  i am 5'6"" 120 lbs  and a 34b. i returned the jumpsuit and ordered it in a small. hopefully it's long enough!!! everything about it is true to size except torso length. i have an average torso  so someone with a large torso m"
-1,"This top is crazy in the front and just way-off when it comes to a cross-over drape. the top did not lay flat and the drape over has one snap which seemed to ""bloop"" open constantly. the bottom in the front is a strange combination of layers that i couldn't get to look good.  i'm busty  but this isn't the reason this blouse is just a disaster of a fit on me. the blouse fits tts and everything was covered  so it's not like it was too small and tugged. that's not the case. this blouse just didn't"
-1,"Sadly  this has to go back. i am 5'5""  128 lbs and this shirt is super short on me. very short. and it's so wide it's almost a trapeze cut. the overall effect is 50s/60s style maternity shirt. which is disappointing because the fabric is beautiful  the detail is nice in person  even the sleeve cuffs are great. i am not very tall and i'm fairly thin on top so i can get away with a lot of styles  loose and tight. the combo of short and trapeze is just unflattering."
-1,I tried this on in the store and i couldn't keep it on my body for more then 30 seconds. it's extremely itchy  which is a pity  because i do appreciate the design. :(
1,I love this shirt! it's such a beautiful striking color  yet still simple enough to not take the spotlight. the peekaboo shoulders are totally cute. i bought another one of these when it went on sale. so now i have two just in case;) haha
0,I have been searching high and low for some good quality jeans. sadly i don't think these are it. i love the design and style of these jeans. great length  great cut  great color unfortunately in the 3 weeks that i have had them they are balling and looking like i've had them for 3 years. i'm so disappointed. and will have to continue on my search. apparently they don't make jeans like they used too?
-1,"Would be flattering on someone who is slim with all the right curves. i'm average size and a mother of 3. the medium was not a true medium. the fabric was amazing. the arm holes were too open/low cut for my taste.   i'm 5'7"" and 140. this landed mid calf. not my preference.     retailer accepted the return with a hassel free refund all under 2 weeks from receiving it."
1,"I got so many compliments from friends  i bought another one in different print. packs and travels well. i'm 5'6"" and a heathy 160 lbs  carry my weight in the middle. this dress is very flattering and fabric feels like pj's. also east to wear with regular undies and racer back bra. living in a warm humid climate  it's my new go to dress. the fabric is so stretchy that i found the medium a better fit instead of my usual large."
0,"I just received this dress in the mail today. i ordered an xs and it was huge! there is no way that i could wear a bra without it showing due to the size of the arm holes. i'm 5'2"" and 117 lbs with an athletic build for reference. i love free flowing dresses  but this was over the top. i ordered the plaid version in an xs petite and that fit much truer to size. i reordered this in an xs petite to see if that will work better. the dress itself is lovely. the green color is vibrant and the embroid"
1,I love this dress so much! i got petite and the length was perfect. it was so soft and so pretty. perfect for a wedding.
-1,I read the other review that said the shirt was boxy  i didn't think it would be a terribly big deal. unfortunately  it is. normally i wear a size s  so i sized down o an xs. the shirt fits in the sleeves and neckline  but the shirt is still very box and now super short. unfortunately  this is going back. not a good fit. adorable details but the fit is terrible.
0,Frustrated that the details don't mention there's a side zip. for whatever reason  i have the hardest time fitting into dresses with side zips and so i was annoyed that the details say it's a pull-on style when that's not the case. there's also no give in the waist. besides the fit not working for me  it was a pretty dress but overall a little too much going on.
0,"This top fits like shown in the pictures. however  i bought the rose color and thought it was a little ""off"". would have loved to find the ivory in my size."
1,Easy to wear and very cute  especially for curvy ladies. but  i think it looks best worn with a best  or a blazer on top  something to emphasize the waist a bit more.
0,Beautiful color and softness  very warm  but the front is way too much material. it just wasn't flattering the way i wanted it to be. perhaps on a taller woman this would work.
0,"Agree with other reviewers: this runs narrow in the skirt. the top is also quite low-cut  and it's already lined so i can't see wearing a cami or slip. i like the black-and-white print and the shape  and might have tried a size larger in the store. finally  it's an awkward  unflattering length. i'm 5'4"" and it hit below my knee."
-1,The fit on this is so strange. the middle string is definitely too long and the thin halter top offers hardly any lift. the print is lovely and the quality nice for the price. the cups are padded  which is nice i suppose  but would barely cover anything bigger than a c cup i'm guessing. i'm a 32dd  size 8 in pants  and size 4/6 in dresses and i ordered a medium. i also have a long torso  which probably didn't help.
1,Got these in my usual size and they are wonderful! the gray goes with everything  i'm hoping they come out with some greens or blues too!
-1,This dress is so cute but it's going back. the zipper is horrible and all of the other reviews are true - you'll need to size up.
-1,The neck is so big on this sweater  i couldn't make it lay right. the shape of the sweater is odd. it is really wide on the upper torso  but tapers near your waist. it did not look as depicted on the model. the sweater is a lovely color  i liked the two-tone  but overall the fit was too weird for me. material is soft and it felt really nice on  but just too oddly shaped and a crazy big neck.
0,This sweater is beautiful  especially in the bordeaux color. the cable knit in varying directions makes it interesting and unique and the length is great for us short waisted ladies. my big issue with this sweater is the sleeves. there really are no sleeves  just arm holes at the same level as the hem of the sweater  so you feel as if you need to keep your arms pinned to your sides to keep from lifting the sweater up to expose your midsection  or pushing the sleeves way up  which then results in
-1,Well made dress  but too much fabric for my taste. it lays a little heavy on the body & does not give a slimming affect. the colors are vibrant & pretty  but the dress is too long  as well. as other reviewers have said  the front is too low cut  but turn it around and it looks & feels better. didn't work for me  sadly  i'll be returning it.
1,I received many compliments on this top. it's very cute and versatile. a pair of jeans or a skirt or capris all can work well with this.
-1,I purchased these pants on 12/2/15 as a more fashionable alternative to yoga pants while traveling southeast asia starting february. after about 10-15 wears (with little washing in between as i was backpacker style traveling) the pants wore through in between my legs. the fabric first started to develop little fuzz balls everywhere and then literally disintegrated in places. i tried to sew them to continue wearing them while traveling but alas the fabric had become so thin that the thread could
1,Can't go wrong with these new charlie's by cartonnier. they fit amazingly. the fabric is a textured cotton but doesn't seem to wrinkle. just shook them out of the bag yesterday. the fabric description says cotton and spandex so they have some give (just a little) but are not going to stretch out after wearing for an hour. paired it with all sorts of different tops. side zip is slimming. lined pockets. substantial fabric. nothing bad to say. if you haven't tried a pair of charlies you should. you
0,The skirt part of the dress falls straight and accentuated my stomach. you can't really tell from the pic. but if you have even the slightest bump of a stomach the dress might make it look worse instead of better because of the way that it is cut. i'm pretty slim - 5'5'' and 114 pounds and it wasn't doing me any favors! the top of the dress is beautiful! i will exchange it for something else. i ordered it online and couldn't try it on before purchasing it.
1,I adore this sweater....  so happy that i was able to get one.  get random compliments from strangers all the time!
1,Gorgeous linen blend tee. purchased in grey and white. classic timeless staples. fits baggy which i love. for reference i am 32a 5'1 105 lbs. love love love!
-1,"There's something majorly wrong with the way the armholes are cut. i can't move my arms in this dress. otherwise the fit was fine. the a line cut of the dress is great if ur trying to hide a few pounds. other than that the does nothing for your figure. i found this dress to be true to size in an xsp im 107lbs and 5'1"". don't buy it. i know it's tempting with the sale price."
1,"This top is beautiful on. i did not find it to be sheer in either the black or the ivory  of which i tried both on. i purchased the black as it was more stunning. i am a medium and it fit absolutely perfect. it has a nice pleat in the front  in case you have a teeny bit of tummy. i found it to be very flattering and will wear it as a date top. it will look awesome with skinny jeans or ponte ankle leggings. the body fabric is a lighter cotton. i am 5'4"" and it hits at hip length. it does not have"
1,"These jeans are an even dark color that can be dressed up. the material is soft and they fit perfect. they are mid rise which is a little different for me as i mostly where low rise. the only problem is that they are really long. i am 5'9"" and they are too long for me which never happens. so i need to get them hemmed and wont be wearing them for a few more weeks. i look forward to rocking them with a pair of booties or heels."
1,I bought this dress because i love the cut-out shoulder look and had been wanting to find something with this trend that i'd feel comfortable wearing. the dress fits well and the shoulder cut-out gives it a trendy look. i love the classic navy color. i was originally hesitant to buy it because of the slub material - which i've always thought to be a cheaper  thin cotton. the slub is more substantial than other slub tops i've seen elsewhere  so i was happy about that. still  it is made with slub
-1,I thought these pants were cute! when i put them on  they fit perfectly  and were comfortable  however i wore them for about 20 minutes and they were a completely different size  and looked awful!
0,"This is a beautiful lined jacket  with a much more structured fit than a typical kimono. it hit me at the high hip  not low hip as shown on the model. given how structured it is  i don't think the ""one size"" will work for anyone larger than a small if you want a drapey kimono fit."
1,"I fell in love with this as soon as i tried it on. it doesn't look nearly as good on the hanger  so definitely worth trying on. the fabric is high quality and super comfy; the fit is very flattering. i am curvy  5'7"" and got the navy stripe print in size small. it's very forgiving  fitted without clinging to any ""problem"" areas. i also love how versatile it is--you can wear it as a dress as shown on the models  or as a tunic over tight jeans or jeggings/leggings. love it!"
0,"The fabric of this skirt is absolutely beautiful. however the fit  albeit unique  is not extremely flattering in my opinion. it may be because i am somewhat of a pear/hourglass shape rather than a more straight shape  but the fit is a little off imo. i am 5'8"" and 135# and ordered both the 6 & 8 and felt the 8 fit a little better."
0,Pretty disappointed in this sweater. should have sized down because it's quite wide. i also didn't like the stair step. the back clung to my rear. not attractive. the colors seemed to be striking online but in reality are not. returning mine.
0,I ordered this to arrive at my store and was so excited to try it on. it was soft and cuddly  but a little baggy under the arms  and it shed everywhere. underwhelmed.
-1,I buy almost ever top tiny puts out and so i grabbed this one in the last tops sale since i'm a sucker for embroidered flowers. everything about it is gorgeous except it is so flimsy i can't even believe it. like when i held it up in the dressing room  i could see through the entire shirt  front to back  before even putting it on. once on  i could see everything through it. i actually thought i was going to tear the thing to pieces trying it on  it's so frail. i own so many tiny shirts and while
1,"Only thing is the fit is a little loose  so i wish the xxs petite wasn't sold out (or that there was a xxs#. at 115 lbs  i tried on e xs regular  that made the skirt a maxi on me #5'1.5""# and it was nice  but a bit loose. i would have worn it as a sexy strapless #i tried it  just not daring enough to actually wear it like that). so i ordered the xs petite  we shall see.    the navy and beige is a nice classy combo  i could see it being pulled off in all seasons  depending how you pair it."
-1,I read the cleaning instructions label carefully. followed them closely. and still  the dye ran and stained some of my colored clothes. pi**ed me off! just after the first wash and even before wearing them  i have streaks of uneven color on the pants. bad quality material or dye is what causes this. now i have to go and see if i can even get out my other stained clothes. thanks a lot retailer.
1,The color and fabric are really soft and lovely. it runs big so you can get away with a size smaller of even 2 sizes smaller. it would look great paired with leggings and boots and a long sweater coat or with skinny jeans and sandals. this is going to be my new favorite.
0,I am a true size small and i ordered this dress and it was way big. it's meant to be a relaxed fit  but it sagged under the arm-holes because the bust was way too big. some folks are saying it ran small and they are essentially the same measurements as me  so it makes me think there is possibly some variation in each size. i got on here to reorder in a smaller size  but now am not sure what to do as i need a dress with in the next three days!
-1,I've been looking for the perfect white eyelet maxi  feels like a perfect summer staple...but sadly this was not it. quality isn't great which is surprise on a $168 price tag. top of dress is lined but cheaply so it's somewhat see through. the dress was returned.
1,Like other reviewers  i'm glad i sized down. this is a cute tunic that is definitely great quality  lightweight chambray. i love that it has pockets  but they do puff a bit at my hips.
1,Absolutely love this dress! i ended up wearing it backwards to work for a more modest neckline  but flipped it around for an evening night out. can't recommend it enough - two of my colleagues ordered it that day.
-1,My personal opinion is that i am not a fan of this top  the material of the fabric doesn't seem as nice as delettas other tops and it had a really boxy fit on me. i wanted to love this top but i did not.
0,Beautiful color; however  the fabric did not work for me. tight on top  large on bottom.
0,"I ordered the neutral and this dress feels and looks great. but my issue is with the fabric. while very comfortable  it fades where its stretched. so around my bust and my back when i moved my arms. i am 5'9""  145 lbs and the small fit me the best but i tried on the medium just to see if it was a fit issue. the fabric still looked weird. i'm disappointed to send it back but i just can't keep it."
-1,I loved the design and look to this shirt  but it ran way big for me. i loved the forgiving fit  but it just wasn't flattering at all. i even went down one size and it still was huge. sad to send this one back.
-1,Tried this on in store. was ill-fitting and sheer.
0,I can usually be counted on to love a pretty top with lace detail and a bit of flow. this one has those qualities but it does not look great on me. perhaps it is too flowy because i am 5?3. or possibly the fabric is too soft a look on me. i did size down as reviewers suggested. maybe one size was not enough :-). i must return it.
-1,The sweater was nice but not as long as on the model. it was itchy also. this sweater was not what i had expected. their was nothing exceptional about it to spend that kind of hard earned cash  sorry retailer. i sent it back .
1,"This dress is perfect for the summer  very lightweight  has pockets and not to short lounging around. it is loose fitting  so i normally wear a size 10 or m and 5'6"" tall  but had to order this dress in a s. the small fits me perfectly."
0,I wanted to love this dress so badly. it came and the material is beautiful  but when i put it on it fit so awkwardly. there was just no way to make it look good. maybe i needed a smaller size  but oh well.
1,Gave this sweater to my mom this christmas and she has hardly taken it off...so cozy and cute!
1,I really liked these leggings  so comfy! they are so soft and the waistband is thick(about an inch wide). i am a size 10 in pants  i got a size m. i have a 33 inch inseam and these came down to my ankles. these leggings have textured stripes at the calf and hip.
-1,I really wanted to like this dress and was so disappointed when it came in the mail. if you have any sort of hips  the light pattern in the middle doesn't do you any favors. this made my hips look soooo wide! and the seaming and gathering in the middle was just off. if it was one continuous piece of fabric it might look better. with the seam  the pattern was cut up and looked pieced together. that just drew too much attention to my stomach and hips. it had to go back.
0,Lovely palette and and fabric but the cut did not flatter my shape. the flowy cut broadened my silhouette and hit at my waist making me look bigger than i actually am. the overall effect was quite frumpy in spite of the flamboyant pattern. perhaps a better choice for someone built exactly like the model.  i will be returning it.
-1,I was in love with this suit from the pictures. unfortunately the top is a little too short so the peplum skirt hits right at my widest part and doesn't meet the bikini bottoms.
-1,When i tried this top on  i started laughing. the two rows of ruffles are made of a starchy thick cotton  which  instead of falling by the hips  juts out like wings. it's also huge. cute idea  wrong material and placement.
-1,"The dress was just too ill fitting and bulky and large. it was more matronly looking then anything and did not fit well. if you are going to try it  probably size down 2 sizes. for reference  i'm 5'4"" and 124 lbs. i bought my normal size 4 and it was very large. i would not recommend as it's just not flattering. i love one shoulder dresses and tops so was very disappointed as i'm an retailer devotee...."
0,I really like the color and flow of this dress. the dress itself fit well however the slip was extremely tight through the bust. i have a large bust at 34d however most dresses are still wearable especially flowy dresses. unfortunately i had to return this one because of the slip.
0,Cute dress but not for me.  the waist is too high and the sleeves are tight.  maybe on a different body type this dress would be perfect.  i returned it.
1,I saw this on a mannequin at the store and was instantly drawn in by all the beautiful blue lace and the overall design. however  when i tried it on  i personally found a few things that just didn't work for me:  ____________  pros:  - blue lace is lovely throughout  nicely done.  - there's a little snap closure at the front of the dress where the fabric overlaps at the bra cups. i can only assume it's to make it easier to get the dress on. it's a nice little detail  although not sure if really
0,These ran very small compared to other charlie pants i've bought in the past. even sizing up  the stripes were not flattering. the lady in the next dressing room over tried them on  too  and had the same feeling i did. the less curvy you are  the better stripes look. they more curvy you are  the less flattering stripes on pants look. the way the stripes come together at the seams just isn't flattering.
1,When i saw another shopper holding up this dress for assessment in my local retailer store  i knew i had to have it! i bought it in the red color and it is gorgeous. the fit was perfect...very flattering style. it can be dressed up or down depending on shoes and jewelry  or boots and a scarf! the detail of the scalloped v in the back is a beautiful addition. perfect for the holidays or even dinner out with friends! beautiful dress!
-1,I loved this t-shirt when i first tried it on: a good cut--not too drapey or fitted. but then i washed it (laid flat to dry) and it shrunk so much that it's unwearable now. so disappointing.
1,Oh my! this dress fits wonderfully on! so ready for autumn! i have a big bust  this dress does not split at the buttons.
1,This is the jacket i've been looking for! i love the collar/lapels - they can lay flat or be worn up a bit. the material is really soft so the jacket is comfy and soft. the sleeves are of a ribbed material that makes the jacket even softer and more comfy. i got the black but it's really more of a charcoal black vs. jet black. the color/dye is saturated and dense so there is no sheen to the material ensures that it will be colorfast. when zipped it's form fitting but not tight (tts - i'm 120 lbs 
-1,I bought this top in black. it is high quality material and i love the mock neck and zipper in back.  however  not only are the armholes are too large  the shirt is cut too short. if i size down for smaller armholes  it becomes a crop top  not a flattering look for 50-something me. i really wanted this to work  but alas  it went back.
-1,I purchased these in january and today i am going back to retailer to request a refund; the fabric on the inner thighs are absolutely thread bare. i am 5'6 and wear a size 28. they fit comfortably with great stretch  but apparently the fabric is so cheap that if your thighs should happen to touch  you will wear holes through the thighs in very short order.    first they started piling  which i had never a pair of pilcro pants do before  and within 2 washes i could actually see through the f
-1,I bought this dress because i saw it in stores when it first came to retailer. it was stunning. the colors were vivid and the beading was intricate. i regretted not purchasing it immediately.       fast forward to today... the dress i received was not the one that was originally in stores. the fabric was different  there was hardly any beading  and the colors were washed out and dull.     i read previous reviews saying that the dress was more like the studio pictures than the original promo. but t
1,These leggings are so comfortable and luxurious.  when i opened the package i knew i was in trouble.  they are comfortable and beautiful.  a perfect piece for any wardrobe.
0,Looks great from the front  but from the side it looks like a maternity top.
-1,I sized down as other reviewers suggested (usually an 8  went down to 6) and the dress fit fine--but it was not attractive. the cut was like a tent with an empire waist. really just not attractive. maybe it has to do with my body type  but compared to the model  this dress was so unflattering in-person. returned.
1,I just ordered this item and wore it yesterday. received compliments from my friends. truly a great sweater. feels soft to the touch. i love the cut and how it falls around my hips. sleeves were nice and long. i am a tall lady with long arms. almost 6 ft  weighing about 155. i got the med which was a perfect fit for me. love the off white. almost thinking of getting the peachy pink too.
1,I had been looking for a green jacket with a hood just like this one and was thrilled to find it. i found the fit to be true to size. i am 5'4  107 pounds and i bought the xs  which is my usual size in retailer jackets. i love the material and the way it hangs so casually.
1,I wasn't immediately attracted to this shirt  but decided to try it on. i loved it on!  it is comfortable and very flattering. i'm a small person  and the length wasn't overbearing on me. it was full  but the stitching around the chest gives it shape and is flattering to a smaller chested person. i'm not sure how it works on a fuller person  but my guess is it may surprise you!
-1,I read all the reviews and was hoping that this top would work for me  but it did not. i ordered a size smaller than usual and it was still way too big. it was not flattering at all on my curvy frame. overall  it looked more like a maternity top on me then anything else! if you're tall and slender  i think this top would work!
0,I expected better from this top  it is thin  will snack easy  and you have to wear a cami underneath. for the price  not worth it. definitely returned!
0,I wanted to love this jacket. so soft and great color. unfortunately it is just too light weight. it is almost like shirt fabric. nice heft to the fabric though. nice length - accept the sleeves were short on me. i am 5'10 and 135lbs. the small was the right size. i was looking for something slightly warmer to layer.
1,Saw this skirt in the sale room and figured i'd give it a try. i'm always looking for comfortable skirts that aren't too tight around the waist. once i zipped it up  i knew it would be a keeper! the waist band is super comfortable and it has a hook/eye closure as well. the material is a little heavier weight  but that's fine it can work for winter as well. it's soft  yet structured. the pockets are always a plus. if you want to step away from the normal shapes and colors  this is out of the box
0,"Like the idea of this longer tee/tunic to wear with leggings but i found it not flowly enough in my regular retailer size ( small). fit on top but not really on the bottom with the side slits. unflattering how the slits hit me. maybe for some one taller ( i am 5'3"")."
0,This top reminded me of a maternity top. cute  but better suited for someone smaller chested.
-1,Completely oversized top  size medium was swimming on me.....boxy  baggy  shapeless -- what more can i say? even in an xs this would not have fit in any way like the photo  returned.
1,"This tunic dress is an easy ""go to"" outfit. it looks put together immediately. it is soft and comfortable. i ordered the regular xs even though typically i prefer petite sizing. this dress is above my knees in the front. i am 5'4"" and weight about 118#. i would have ordered a petite size but had previously tried this on in the store and knew the regular sizing was a good fit for me. in the store i tried the taupe color which seemed a bit see through. i ordered the green and it is a lovely shade."
-1,I love the color of this dress. it is not flattering  even though it should be. the weird panels of different materials makes it hang super funky. the lace is heavy but the silky panels aren't. so not flattering  it's just odd. and the fit is super huge  you are swimming in it in addition to a poor body drape. it could have been so cute  but was executed so poorly.
-1,I ordered a size smaller prr other reviewers but that still didn't prepare me for the sweater's issues. it looks really cute but the quality is pretty horrendous. i wore it for the first time today and already the sweater is pilling a lot on my back. seriously heartbroken.
0,"This shirt looks nice on the model  but it felt stiff and unflattering on me. i am 5'5""  135lbs  34c  and the size 4 fit overall. i just didn't happen to like it on me."
-1,I was so sad not to love this dress. it is beautiful  but is so unflattering on. there is a lot of material under the arms and it gathers up due to the smocking. so  it just made me look incredibly frumpy. i don't really think a petite would have helped - the gathers just bunch a bit and so rather than hang  the dress sort of clumps. i am lean but broad shouldered and maybe that is the problem  but i was super disappointed. narrow shouldered people with long torsos could pull this off. it is a t
1,I absolutely love the print. it's what caught my eye first when scrolling down the page. the fabric is very soft  single layer. the model definitely makes this shirt look slimmer or tighter to the body than the shirt actually is. the slimmer fit was the next thing i was looking forward to  but like other reviews  it is very flowy and the fabric falls away from the bottom below the bust (which i'm not mad about when wearing this in the summer--the occasional breeze will feel nicer with a loose to
-1,These pants were wonderful...for 2 seasons. yes  for almost $200 a pop they don't even last a full year! loved them so much  i bit the bullet & bought 4 pair. all 4 started to rip in the same spot! i tried to contact ag directly & they do not back up their products after 30 days. fortunately  retailer was wonderful (as always!) i will buy pilcro from now on - much better product for the money.
1,"I hate buying dresses because i rarely find one that fits well. i'm very petite on top (xsmall) and small/med on bottom  5'8"". usually dresses are tight on my hips & thighs and loose up top. this fairly lightweight yet warm dress is such a winner! form-fitting yet stretchy and forgiving in all the right places. the x-small and small both fit pretty well but i decided to go with the x-small on this one. i think this will be a staple winter/fall dress. loved the fit so much i bought it in the peac"
0,Pros: pretty  nicely made.    cons: the fabric is stiffer than i was expecting  and the blouse cuts in under the arms. (i don't mean that it is tight or digs in  but it cuts in; you can't tell in the angle of the photo.) the blouse is short as well  and  as i am curvy  it really stuck out all around at the waist. worth trying on if you have a straighter figure.
1,I ordered the xl in the green motif. the shirt is fitted through the body. i'm a pear-shape so it's tight around my hips. it's cut straight down. i'll need to wear this tucked in or belt it/pull it up a bit closer to my waistline so it's more comfortable. the colors & pattern in the green motif are prettier in person. i love orange roses & haven't found any shirt or dress with orange roses before so i kept it. i used my birthday discount to splurge on this. i think it's over-priced for what it i
0,I loved this dress  i usually wear a petite but went with regular based on the reviews. i workout and it was snug on my arms.. fabric felt great  loved the fringe.. just a but snug in the arms for me.
-1,I ordered this vest in xxs  since i am usually an xs and was looking for a bit of a tighter fit on such a loose vest. even then  the vest looked like a large. not only was it incredibly loose - much looser than in looks in the picture - but the arm holes were huge too. it just looked too big  not artfully drapey.
-1,I wish i had read the reviews prior to purchasing. this skirt looks amazing in photos and lace appears black. the lace on mine is actually purple - at first i thought it was just purple due to lighting with red underneath - but nope - pull the netting away and it is purple. lace netting hikes up on the right due to poor craftsmanship. i ordered a medium and felt it was a bit large. will return.
1,I tried the gray pattern on in the store and it is very soft and pretty. the fabric has a nice drape to it. however the length was too long on me  so i came online to find it in petite  but most of the petite sizes are sold out in the gray. i shop at retailer because i like it that so many of their styles are available in petite  however the petite length sizes seem to sell out much faster than the regular sizes. i hope retailer will give us short girls a break and order more petite length sizes so
0,Cute little dress fits tts. it is a little high waisted. good length for my 5'9 height. i like the dress  i'm just not in love with it. i dont think it looks or feels cheap. it appears just as pictured.
1,Great romper i personally would not wear it for ever day - i will be wearing it for a beach cover up while on vacation. for reference i ordered a m and am 130 34b.
0,Pretty color  great details  awesome stitching.. aaaaannnnnnd it actually not only goes out a line but ballooned out above the hem and then came back in - just too much fabric down below. nice at neck  arms and chest but disastrous anywhere below that.
0,I bought this in size xl and the overall fit matched the model's photos. the neckline was a bit higher than pictured. the material was pretty in person. the problem was the material's threads were too scratchy. i was uncomfortable with that scratchiness against my neck so i returned it. i did like the unique leaf pattern of the lace.
1,I'm normally a small in retailer tops  but i could tell that this would run big. i'm glad i sized down to an extra small. this top is flowy and airy without being baggy. the colors are summery and beautiful. my only complaint is that it's a bit sheer  and i can see the outline of my bra in front. i will have to wear a cami underneath.
0,I am on the fence about this one. the length is great. it hits right above my knee at 5'1. overall it was larger than i was hoping. the waist is pretty loose  and i really had to tightly tie the back to get s good shoulder fit. the bottom is very voluminous making me look wide. i wish they had it in a petite size. for this price  i will probably return it. it's not worth the 300 price tag.
0,"I coveted this item since i first saw it on instagram. i finally bought it in coral. it's a beautiful coat  the color is lovely and i like the way the hood makes a cute collar when worn down. the only problem is it looks like a bathrobe on me. i am 5'5"" and wear a size 8. i bought a medium  worried a small would not button. the sleeves are far too long. i do not want to go through the trouble of returning  so gave it to my daughter who is four inches taller. it looks cute in her."
1,"Really pretty for summer  especially beach and pool wear. but i'm only 5'1 and even the petite is i think a tad long for flats (which is my preferred shoe for this dress). i'm also ""curvy and busty on top  so unless you are blessed with a nice thin waist it's not as flattering as the tall thin model shows. but still it looks nice on  and i though it might look good also with white footless tights i have too. so i'm on the fence about keeping it  since it's really pretty for a summer party."
0,This is a beautiful dress. the lace top is stunning! the fit is true to size  and there's no stretch. i had the same problem as other reviewers... that darn zipper. it's so small and gets hung up easily. i could see it eventually failing in the future.
1,Super cute and comfortable! soft fabric drapes nicely. i wear this with an orange skirt  white shirts or jeans. i get lots of compliments on this top and get more use out of it than expected! i'm so glad i tried it on! a nice surprise.
-1,This would have been cute if it was more fitted. i am 5'7 and 125 lbs and the small was too wide. i didn't try the xs because the small was almost too short in the sleeves and so was the length.
0,"I tried this sweater on in the store. i wanted to love it so badly as it is soft and feminine  and would be a great causal layering piece. however  there are pockets in the sweater that are right on seam  and they actually bubble out from the natural drape of the sweater. not to mention  unless you're built very narrow  the pockets will fall at  and accentuate hips  and not in a flattering way. the nice details are the feel of the knit  the layered style  with a cottony lined hood and ""faux"" lay"
1,I love this top! i ordered the print  and it will go perfectly with blue or white jeans  and even coral shorts. very flattering. i did go up a size (from xs to s) based on other reviews  and i'm glad i did. the larger size fits perfectly at the bust and falls just below the hip.
1,I normally wear a 4  and that technically fit if i didn't plan to sit. i went a size up and it was still gorgeous but now i could breathe.  it is incredibly sexy yet sophisticated  my husband is always asking why i need another dress and when he saw me in he fitting room his eyes lit up and he said you definitely need to get this dress. needless to say i'll wear it on our next date..
1,This is a lovely blouse. it has an empire waist type cut  which camouflages tummy and hips nicely (especially after a large holiday meal!). i'm usually between a small and medium (4-6) and didn't really notice much of a different between the two sizes.  **note: it does not come with the camisole shown in the photo  but any black or white standard camisole would work.
0,I received this skirt today and was very disappointed. i don't know what i expected but it is not as i thought. even though the quality is very good and the fit is true to size  i may return it. the fabric of the skirt is just too busy  at least for me. i am just uncertain and even though i have many tops  the colors are just not matching. white looks better than any colored top with this particular print. i am going to try it on one more time and make a definite decision.
-1,"The fit is so bad and the construction is very poor. i'm 5'1''  100 lbs  ordered xxs petite.     first of all  when i button this  there is extreme gaping going on. the vest runs narrow  yet tall?it shifts up my torso if i move at all  making the gaping even worse.    the ""skirt"" at the bottom is made of a very cheap  thin  slightly sheeny material that you would find at a flea market. it arrived unbelievably wrinkled and crumpled  and it was just so thin. it did not meet as closely in the middl"
1,These are some of my favorite new pants. i am never disappointed by the quality from this brand and they are super comfortable and adorable. a definite must have!
-1,I had high hopes ordering this top...unfortunately the top has a metallic fiber to the material and that detail was not noted in the product description! it also felt rather cheap & scratchy  poor quality for the price.
0,Color is pretty true to pic  a bright blue red.  sleeves have more volume than pic.  so does the body.  in my opinion.  maybe if i looked like the model.  i wear a 27 in jeans and it doesn't look so cute on me.  also i'm a brunette.  angles?  pinning?  i have to wonder.  probably just pics at good angles.  it looks really cute on the model though.
1,This top is very well made. nice heavy material for those in between days. the back is slightly longer than the front and it is well finished inside. i ordered a 00 which fits great in the body area  but a little tight on my arms. still a keeper!
0,I tried the yellow striped dress on in the store and it is completely sheer.
1,I agree with other reviewers that this top runs large - i'm glad i ordered a size down. it's a cute twist on a basic tee shirt.
-1,Wanted to love this colorful romper. the fabric was suuuuper thin and very cheap feeling and looking. no way would i wear this.
1,Dress is darling and well made. however  it runs very large. i tried to size down but then it became a little short in xsp. would be great for taller slim women. the style is so cute. the online picture does not do it justice.
1,I am not sure why so many gave only 3 stars  yes  this top is for a strapless bra  my bra top (where the strap starts  0 was showing  but so nice... shape was ok for me  it does go in at the hem  givinng a bubble-like shape  but it's part of the charm. i dnd't experience the loose straps  but didn't pay attention to that when i tried it on. also didn't notice the stitching was red in the store  but checked  and yes  that's true... love it.    not an online exclusive  as it was in my store  i pur
-1,I purchased this sweater in a small . nothing on the web site states it has dolman sleeves! it looked sloppy and made my bust disappear! it went back i hate dolman sleeves.
1,I love this top. the picture does not show all the beautiful detail. i was so happy when it came in the mail and i unwrapped it. stunning!!
0,Just received two  the red and the black. the black is a great print  very versatile. both run large  but the black most significantly so. the red is close enough to fitting to keep. the black shows my bra b/c it is so large and the armholes cut far too deeply. (the red also shows a fair amount of the armpit area  but (barely) covers my bra.    the material is somewhat thinner than expected  but not so sheer that a skin-toned bra wouldn't be sufficient.
-1,I ordered this shirt online and didn't even try it on... it is super see through and i would need to wear a tank underneath and i don't want to have that extra layer in the summer.  it is cute though!
1,I just discovered this dress a few days ago and it's simply dreamy!! i'd been searching for the perfect summer dress to wear to a wedding in june but had been highly disappointed in the selection of pastel colors from other shops. this dress is the perfect summer shade and will be perfect for the texas heat in june! i absolutely love how it flows and is elegant yet modest. the lace cut-outs are gorgeous!
0,Cute but too thick and rough
0,I bought both black and white shirt. white is see through completely. black is ok. but the material is still too thin. i feel like it is going to tear after the first wash. not worth the money. i bought plenty of similar shirts from the same brand and this run is way too cheap.
0,The skirt in person is not like the picture. baggy and runs large. i wear jean size 25 and the xs is two size too loose. there's no pocket which is surprising on a denim. the slit in front makes the skirt  look even loose   no shape near what's in the picture. and there's no petite sizes. i am going to return it.
1,I love how soft  and substantial the fabric is. the fabric has a nice weight and drapes beautifully. the ruffle detail is very flattering. i have broad shoulders and this top looks great.
1,I find that maeve shirts tend to run a little small. i'm usually an 8 but needed this in a 10. this shirt is reallly just perfect. great sleeve length. just the right amount of v neck. beautiful pattern with a vintage feel. i love the combo of stripes  polka dots and sweet flowers.
0,This is a cute top that has a nicer texture and sheen to the velvet in person than the pictures do justice to...it's just simply richer and prettier in person.  there's a nice drape to the fabric  but it's cut pretty short and wide  which isn't flattering imo  unless you are very petite and have a small bust. i say this as someone who is small enough that i usually welcome a shorter cut top because most normal length tanks and tops are tunic length on me.  i would have given it a higher star rat
1,Super soft  light fabric. this dress is perfect for work or the weekends. this brand is new to me but i'll definitely be checking out their stuff more in the future.
-1,I love byron lars dresses  and this design is on-point. the ruffle at the neckline is so pretty  and the dress fits like a dream. however -- the fabric!!! i would have loved it if this dress had a heavier feel. this is  sadly  going back today.
-1,I loved the idea behind this shirt but it just hangs around the waist with tons of extra fabric. i suspect the model in the photo has the shirt pinned. totally unflattering making the chest look small and your midsection appear huge. maybe if you size down it would be better- xs was not available for me to try. also the lavender color is really washed out...
1,Absolutely adore this dress and plan onwearing it to a wedding. it is so well made and luxurious  i feel amazing in it! even more gorgeous in person
-1,I've been shopping at retailer since 2007  and floreat used to be my favorite designer  but for the past year or more  floreat mostly misses the mark. this blouse looks nothing like it does on the model.   1. it is long on her  not so in real life. this is probably the worst part about this blouse. if it were not for this  i might try on a size m and give it another chance.  2. it runs very large. i usually take a l or xl. i think i would need a m in this  as mentioned above.  3. in the picture  t
-1,I was so excited to order this dress. i loved that it had a normal neck  nice length  and there wasn't a hole in the back. but this dress is just plain awful. the top fit tight across the bust  it flattened me out like i was wearing a too tight sports bra. then the back zipper puckered and bumped up like there is too much zipper for the fabric. i could not get the zipper to lay flat. the fabric is itchy and very cheap feeling. on top of it all the colors are much brighter than they appear in the
-1,After reading the reviews i placed an order because it was the only top that caught my eye on the entire price downs. lately all my usual l/10 sizes from retailer turn out huge so i ordered a size smaller from what i usually wear. all would have been ok if the top wasn't so darn short. for reference i'm 6 ft tall  160 lb. it's weird that this top looks completely the opposite of the model on the photo  from a loose looking fit with longer sleeves looking like a stylized sweatshirt that is not what
1,Excellent quality blouse and sooo pretyy!! i was worried when i saw on-line that is 100 % cotton. i though it was a cotton blouse that would get wrinkly. but i was pleasantly surprised when i saw it in the store! it is a substantial weight cotton/gauze that looks like hand stitched embroidery. i'd say it fits tts.
0,Great style but not so great quality:(  stone fell off right away.  but they still look great
0,Low waisted  weird liner.
-1,This top looked positively vulgar on!!!! i am a 34d  and it was way too low cut...my boobs were spilling out!!! in addition  the fabric reminded me of a cheese cloth.....it just looked and felt cheap. unfortunately  this top will be going back.
-1,This dress was not what i had hoped! from the online pictures  i had high hopes  but the fit was really wonky and the material seemed cheap. the arm holes were too big and made the dress seem more like a bathing suit cover up than a classy summer dress. needless to say  it's going back!
0,Pretty top online - okay in person. runs small  especially on bottom hemline. thought it would have a swing to it. it does not. more sheer in person than i thought it would be. that wouldn't stop me from keeping it though. it was the way it laid on my chest that was unflattering. looked like i was wearing a bib. i don't have a large chest  just weird look on me. unfortunate  because it is an adorable print. top made for thinner or a petite lady.
0,I'm tall and small chested so the dress didn't fit me perfectly. i adore the color and pattern  but wish it was less revealing in the chest area. i definitely have to wear something under. otherwise high quality and unique dress!
-1,Not as cute as photos  and too small in chest. i am 5'5''  125 lbs  and the small was too tight in the chest  and i am not large here at all. shoulders and sleeve length fit well. will return. not comfortable  and will need to be able to button it on rainy days.
1,I love this vest. get compliments every time i wear it. it's stretchy too :). unfortunately i got ranch dressing on it and spot treated it with shout and now the spot is gone but the color faded there. so little tip don't spill on it lol. my fault though so still 5 stars!
-1,The bottom part of this romper is easy to put on  but the top is very poorly designed. it needs a zipper at the side or less of a yoke along the back. you have to wrangle your limbs in somehow and i was afraid it might tear. once i got it on  it fit perfectly though. getting out of it was a disaster. i had to ask a saleswoman for help and was so afraid it might rip. overall  i was crushed that it didn't work out because the print is super cute and it is very flattering.
1,I got this for my girlfriend and was happy they had additional sizes online as we were not able to find this in the store. we loved that this could be worn stand alone  with leggings  or as an over-shirt. it's very versatile and is perfect for your fall wardrobe.
0,I have a collection of this artist's paintings throughout my home. she is a favorite. i was so excited to see the first clothing item offered at retailer. i ordered it at full-price. it looks the same in person as in the photos. the fit was true to size--it fits me as shown on the models. the knit was comfortable. the problem was the printed fabric. it was so flimsy and kept attracting static. no matter what i tried  i couldn't get the static problem solved. it was unwearable because of how messy
0,I ordered this and didn't even try it on when it came. the color was not as i expected...it had pinkish undertones and it just wasn't what i was looking for as far as color. also  the fabric is very thin not like the other two tunic dresses i have ordered recently from retailer (toscana tunic & sandscape swing dress). it was also easy to see that this runs large. oh well  thought i might have one more fresh summer tunic dress to throw on in a flash but i'm happy with the other two (i was finally a
0,I love cashmere  love the length  cowl-neck and colors  however i found the yellow to be bit more vibrant in person  which i liked. i'm not sure i will keep this because it seemed to be a bit too thin for my taste. i would gladly pay a bit more for a thicker ply sweater... i might justify this one at a sale price.
-1,"This sweater was a big let down. i am 5'2"" so i ordered it in a petite. it was so short that if i lifted my arms  you'd see my bra!! there is no way i could wear it without something under it- even with high waisted bottoms. and the bell sleeves look nothing like the pic. the entire sleeve is just wide  and it continues with little increase into the cuff. it is just short and boxy. it is going back for sure."
0,This is so bulky and itchy...could not stand to have it on! i'm a 6/8 & ordered the small  but it was still gigantic.
-1,The material is beautiful and high quality however the cut is so awful! it lays very weird near the neck and shoulder area. it kind of forms this square but if you are larger in the bust area it causes the top to slant making it lay awkward.
0,I tried this on in my regular size and a size up. just didn't work in either. the attached slip bunched underneath and the material was rough. i did not purchase it.
-1,I had such high hopes for this shirt! i got it in both the black and moss (which is a beautiful color). however  the ruffle was just too big. i put it on and immediately felt like a circus clown. it would probably be beautiful on a woman with a more straight figure with fewer curves  but on me  it was not flattering at all.
1,I know it's a bit of a moot point since the chemise has sold out - but on the off chance any come back in stock  or if you see one at your local store - i urge you to try it on! the fabric is incredible. so luxurious. it fits me amazingly. i have a hard time with the whole tight chemise/slip/nightie category of clothing  as i'm fairly skinny  but still curvy  and while i love my curves  i do have a muffin top that can get real awkward when you're trying to look sexy. this  however  is a godsend.
-1,....that's what i look like wearing this dress. a sad  sad  sack. the fabric is less than ideal  and there is no shape to speak of. i love that it has pockets but that's about it. there was just way too much fabric for a petite person. this dress has got to be good on someone  sadly that person was not me.
1,I purchased this top on 2 colors...a great go to....stylish  soft and very comfortable.
0,This is a cute  flattering dress  however the drop-waist  the short length and the odd-length sleeves (shorter than shown in the photos!!!) added up to me feeling like i was dressing way to young. it just didn't convey an elegant  mature vibe. this dress is perfect for a 20s-30s woman who wants a versatile dress to wear on many occasions. it's great because it's not too expensive and you could wear it with any type of shoes.    my big problem is the lack of transparency regarding the actual slee
0,I should have exchanged it for a smaller size  but i wanted to wear it  so my mistake. i tend to wear size 12-14  and the large is entirely too big. it also had piling right out of the bag. but it is just so soft that i tore the tag off and wore it anyway. if you get this  size down for sure.
1,This tank is great - goes well with black pants of skirt. it's a nice texture that doesn't show too many wrinkles so will travel well. it's a bit hard to get the buttons done in the back of the neck  but i assume that will get easier with time.
0,"Fit and style very nice. returned because way too long and bottom detail interfered with hemming. they were at least 4"" too long. i am 5'8"" so heels would fix the issue but i don't want to wear them with a comfy pair of pants."
-1,This is huge. i thought it would be oversize but with a bit of shape. there is no shape to this and is a lot of material. i ordered an xs and typically wear an xs or s in blouses  sometimes medium in sweaters.  it seamed like 2 sizes too big. the material is very soft and the collar is nice. there is a ribbon tie at the waist. the tie is wimpy and could be nicer. when tied  there is so much fabric the is gathers and looks like i have no waist.
-1,While i love the fabric and the pattern  this skirt leaves too much to be desired. the full price is absurd considering what you get.  there is no mention online that there is no built in slip  and as the material is extremely thin a slip is an absolute must. (see attached photo.) even in dim lighting you can see straight through.   also for this price point it is strange that the skirt is 'pull-on styling.' i would say that it is true to size  and i am usually a medium @ retailer  but i have a sm
-1,I found this piece very boxy and not very feminine. i tried to make it work but i just wasn't feeling it the material is thin and the design is boring. unfort  it wasn't for me.
0,"I really had high hopes for this dress. i had several issues with it  though based on the high ratings other customers did not experience the same problems.   1- it was to short. i am 5'8"" and it was really really short on me. i could not sit down in it.   2- i found that it ran large. i've lost some weight recently  so perhaps i've gone down a size  but the medium was like a sack on me.   3-the waist was really roomy. it ballooned out to the point that it was comical.   4- as others have noted "
1,I thought these were great everyday shirts for the price. i got them on sale over christmas. they fit well and i really love the striped shirt. the navy is an odd color and looks strange with jeans but i love the top regardless
-1,I waited six weeks for this dress to arrive and was so disappointed. loved the skirt part of it. but the top  which i guess i didn't see in photo was pleated as well  made my bust look huge and it puffed out on sides. would have been a wonderful summer dress  flowing and cool.
1,I was running low on good summer shorts and thought i'd try these based on having a pair of the pilcro cropped pants i got a couple months ago. i tried these shorts on in-store to make sure they fit right and that i liked how they looked but then bought them online (more colors were available in my size than what they had in store). i bought these in 3 different colors and i absolutely love them all! they are my go-to shorts now  they look good with the legs rolled up or down  and i will be wear
-1,"I love retailer and fell in love as soon as i saw this dress online. being 5'10"" i love a quality maxi dress and this one did not disappoint. however  being 5'10"" also means the top sweater overlay hits me way short. it looks ridiculous. i also thought that this was very heavy for a maxi dress and could not imagine wearing it in 80 degree weather. unfortunately after waiting so long for it's arrival this is going back."
0,"This dress has great potential. i happen to have a longer torso so the fit was off. as a previous review stated  it's short waisted and a lot a skirt which i agree  the hem is also funky. i am still deciding if i want to keep it  but if i do  i plan on altering the skirt to be narrower and hemming it a bit shorter too. for reference  i'm 5'3"" and weigh 110 and i purchased a size 0."
0,I don't think they are an easy fit cut  they are more like skinny jeans. as i was looking for something more relaxed i decided to return them. the quality of the material is good  the color is nice.
0,The material of the shirt and the ties are two different materials. the shirt is a very soft cotton  but the ties are of a more dressier material. i expected the shirt to be of the dressier material. overall it is a cute shirt  just not what i expected.
1,This dress is perfect. it's ridiculously soft (i felt like i was wearing pajamas) and it fits perfectly. the quality is great; well worth your purchase.
1,I was a bit dubious of the top because online the video of it made the top look frumpy - wide and wrinkled looking. the top seemed shorter in the video than in the pictures. so i wondered if the images were massaged a bit in photoshop. i got it today and it's fully lined and the material is pretty thick which gives it a rich look and feel. i like the top even though it highlights my hips a bit and being pear-shaped i don't normally like that  but being thin helps. the best part of the top is the
1,This was a return in my sale room and i just decided to try it on. love it! fits true to size thought kind of hard to zip up all the way. colors are great. got the petite size. the pattern is different for each one so each is unique. mine has. lot more navy blue.
0,I love the fabric and design of these leggings  but unfortunately they ran way to big up top. they literally fall down.
1,I think it's a little on the long side and the sleeves are a little tight but otherwise i really like this jacket. it's lightweight for summer and yet more stylish than the other long sleeve things i grab in case i get cold.
1,I love camisoles like this  and retailer always has great ones! it has a nice length  so the lace detail can show underneath a jacket or shorter cardigan. it's fitted  but not tight.
0,This skirt and top is nothing like the picture. the skirt is black not maroon. top is also black. although the skirt is nice  the image was fabulous. the side panels of the skirt are also a knit. quality is good but skirt is overpriced for what it is. would have expected suede or leather panels for the money. not sure if going to keep or not. was really looking for the maroon color instead of the black.
1,Really love this bathing suit. it fits very well  definitely don't need to size up for this one. flattering to my mom-bod and breasts that have seen perkier days. excited to be taking this one to costa rica with me this summer!
-1,This dress is beautiful and extremely well made... if you can get into it. the only way to close the dress is a line of difficult to button buttons up the back. it's form fitting  so you'd better be on your yoga a game or have a loved one or hand maiden to lend a hand. i thought about taking it to a tailor to install a hidden side zipper  but it's soooo form fitting i'm afraid i wouldn't wear it.
-1,This is a beautiful dress  but the fit was strange. i have a small waist and larger hips. i generally wear a 0-2 in a fit & flare style  but styles like this i generally wear a 2-4 for my hips. even in a 4 this was catching on my hips and looked kind of dumpy on my top half.  i really think this dress would be great on a frame that had wider shoulders and smaller hips. it really is pretty.
1,Love this! fits great. warm and soft. would recommend
0,Love the color and design but way to small. i can wear a small in many manufacturers but certainly not in this one. the medium was like an extra small. sorry because i liked what i saw in the advertisement. as an older lady i love your well made  fresh  styles but need to be able to trust that a size is true to form.
-1,"The design of this dress was very off for my 5'4""  120 lb  32d frame. it's low-cut and tight in the bust  but then very voluminous and unstructured around the hips  making me look wide there. a belt didn't help much. the fabric is nice  but the overall effect of the dress was frumpy."
-1,Dress just did not fit will around the hips.  also the string belt was defective - basically about to come off.  looks like someone may have wore it and returned it.  was not flattering at all.
1,Love this shirt. tried it on in 2 of the colors and both were very flattering. the quality of the shirt is great. worth the price for sure!
-1,Bought the gold pair and dripped something on them so spot cleaned them with water only. my white washcloth turned bright yellow. the food came out but surrounding area was super faded. so i returned them  took the second pair home  wore them a few times  they stretched out so much  washed them in cold water and they have splotches that are really light. these pants are way too much trouble.
1,Love love the print on these but the fit is off. i tried on the solid color in this same style and i took my regular size 30. these i needed a 12. the waist seems really small but the bottom leg parts stretch out and are kind of baggy after 1 wear. i can't go down a size because the waist was too small on the 10. since i love the print so much it may be tolerable. rare for hei hei to fit wonky.
1,As one would expect from boucle  this sweater is incredibly soft  warm and cozy without being heavy. i fell in love with it when i first saw it and got it in white color. it's beautiful  goes with casual and work clothing (belt helps with the latter styling)  and it didn't leave lint on the dark skirt i wore with it to work! i usually wear xs or s and found this sweater to be still roomy in xs  with sleeves being a bit long. i hope it won't stretch with wear as boucles sometimes do - that's my o
1,Like all maeve tops of this nature  i am absolutely in love! maeve always has a cute spin on an otherwise basic top. this top looks great with jeans  shorts  skirts  etc. i purchased it in all 3 colors. the blue is more of a robins egg blue  the orange is a great tangerine color (perfect for us tennessee fans!)  and the ivory is a wonderful brownish-white. the ivory is my favorite because it's a very unique color.. i have a ton of white and ivory tops  but i do not have one in a color like this
0,This brand has odd fitting of late. i normally wear a m in retailer tops but i had to size up to 12 on this shirt as it was tight across my chest. i am a b cup and had a sports bra on when i tried it. brought it home and tried on with a regular  non pushup bra and it pulls slightly. i might return it because my guess is that it will shrink when washed. otherwise  its a cute tunic style top.
0,Overall  the dress is beautiful  easy  and great quality. but the bottom part has more fabric than it appears in the photo  if that makes sense. it's not poofy or super-layered  but i had to pinch fabric on a part of the dress in order for it to have that more straight/shift shape that you see online here. besides that bottom part  the fit is true to size. but as a petit  the extra fabric isn't what i'm looking for. i think it works depending on what you're looking for. beautiful though!
0,I love love love these pants!!! they actually fit me and look great!!!! buyer beware that the dye used is very delicate. i had a very slight stain on them that most likely only i noticed  but i decided to use a spray and wash stain remover. the resulting removal of the stain came with a very large loss of color anywhere the stain remover touched. unfortunately this has made these pants unwearable. buy  wear and wash these with care!!!
0,While there is nothing wrong with this top  it didn't really have an retailer feel. it looked more like something from a dept store  maybe a boutique. i got on sale but sending back bc i just don't like it that much  especially next to my pale skin. i could see it looking much better in someone with darker skin tone. i'm usually a 8/10 med. small in this top fit well.
-1,I have somewhat sensitive skin and this fabric is awful! in addition to it having no give  feeling like it will stretch out  and being slightly see-through  it is super scratchy!! it has little bits of what look to be tree material in the fabric.. awful!
-1,Way too big and had a granny like styling. was very excited but ultimately took it back.
1,"I purchased this in the ""purple"" which is more blue than purple  but you can definitely see the purplish hue depending on the light. it's a beautiful  rich indigo color. it's very comfortable. i usually go for more fitted styles  but i was pleasantly surprised at how flattering this top is even though the body of the shirt is more loose fitting. i'm very excited to wear this top this summer. i haven't worn and washed it yet  so i am hoping the color and material will hold up after washing. i am"
1,"I have been eyeing this top for a couple weeks and finally found it in my store. it was a good sign when i saw our stores in-house stylist wearing it! i absolutely love the fit--it's soft and stretchy and fabric is nice quality. i'm typically a medium  sometimes large--i bought the medium and it's perfect. i could have gone down to a small as well. the large was way too big (for reference i'm 5'8""  athletic  150lbs). this top is going to take me everywhere this summer! worth a try!"
1,I purchased this shirt in blue and i like it. the fabric is more of a stretchy/jersey material - didn't expect that. but the shirt looks decent on and is comfortable.
0,Runs really big. i usually wear small and this was falling off my shoulders. very comfortable and soft material. also looks brighter in pic than in person.
1,Very cute. i received many compliments when i wore it. fits true to size (petite 2) with some good stretch in it. i am 5'3 and it was slightly longer than that on the model. it is a little odd that the buttons are all not the same. but perhaps that is part of its charm and it is not noticeable. it is very comfortable and the pictures are representative of what it looks like.
0,"Soft  cozy  and cute  but pilled badly after 1st wearing and now will be relegated to wearing at home only. for this reason i cannot recommend. felt like i wasted my money. i purchased the xs petite ( i'm 5'1"". 95 lbs) and i could have gone down to xxs  but i was ok with it being looser."
-1,"Too much material everywhere. i am 122lbs 5'4"" and i ordered an xs as usual. i was overwhelmed in a blanket of knitted material of muted colors. nice green slip  though. i will return it asap. this is super-ugly."
-1,I loved the design online but the sweater is bulky and boxy. i had chosen the cream with blue and now looking back at the other pictures of the beige/cream it represents it better. it made me look very wide. loved it online but it wasn't for me  returned it.
1,I ordered top and pants online as seen. pants are of good quality and hang beautiful.  i love the color and quality of the fabric. nice and vibrant. nice fit at the top into a flowy drape. the top runs big and glad i ordered down one size. love the outfit for my upcoming island trip.
1,I got the navy blue pattern and i absolutely love it. it's soft and cozy and just dressy enough to pull an outfit together.  i initially sized up to a 10 based on other reviews but exchanged it for an 8  my normal size. it's flowy so the bigger size was way too much fabric. in the 8 it's just right for the style.
0,"The dress is too big. i got size 4  after checking the measurements chart (for reference: 5'7""  125 lb). it is too wide  not as fitted as in the picture. the cut is too deep (might work better for a bustier lady  but looks pathetic on me).     the pattern is too bright  much brighter that in the picture (i got red pattern). it's not that the photos represent the colors inaccurately  it's just... the colors are much more vibrant in real life.    the material is heavier than i expected."
-1,This dress was very boxy and unflattering. i really wanted to like it because the blue and white details were so pretty but it had to go back.
-1,I really loved the way this shirt looked on me. it's forgiving and flattering  and really lightweight. the fabric  however  couldn't even withstand half a day's wear without snagging 3 times and developing a hole right in the center. i have no idea how this happened  as i wasn't wearing or near anything that could have pulled at it.     such a shame. this could have been a staple wardrobe piece for me.
0,This top is a little more casual than i anticipated especially for the price. it is completely sheer and you do need a tank under it. also  the arm and neck makes it look more like a ordinary teeshirt. still  the lace design is super cute and would work well with both skirts and jeans.
0,I wanted to love this dress! i ordered it when there was a 20 percent off special and couldn't wait to get it. the colors are as depicted and the dress fit true to size. i also liked that it wasn't too short. what i didnt like was that the dress is lined in white  which you can plainly see in the picture  but i didnt notice before ordering. i just think it would have been much prettier lined in black. im disappointed and the dress is going back.
-1,Bought this shirt on sale. it was super cute in the dressing room  and for the first time i wore it. washed it per the instructions (wash delicate with cold water  lay flat to dry) and it shrunk so much i don't think i'm going to be able to wear it anymore. it was oversized and loose when i bought it  so it shrunk a lot. there is also a small hole all of the sudden  that i have no idea where it came from (wasn't there when i put it in the washer). very disappointed.
1,"The colors on these leggings are just beautiful!  the material is very soft and has a nice thickness to it.  no issues with see thru material.  i am 5'8""  145  and i ordered my usual medium."
0,"This dress has so much potential but doesn't make it.  i read all the reviews and very few were favorable and still took my chances. fabric color and textures is great but the design is really off.  with the little folds on the shoulder and since the fabric is more on the thick side  all this make it to accumulate the ""extra"" weight on the front of the body and as result ""not flattering"" for the majority of ladies including me  it is a shame since it has may great features  the style: flowy  low"
1,Walked into the retailer store in new york  while on vacation  and saw this on display. had to try it on immediately and loved the look. received several compliments from customers in the store. it's beautifully made  soft on the inside and makes a great statement piece that i will enjoy for years to come!! you will need to size down cause it runs large. i love it............
0,"The fabric of this dress feels like suede  i couldn't stop touching it. here comes the ""but"": the dress is cut straight down  no definition. the rosette lace is sewn on  like an afterthought just to make the dress not to look plain or cheap. i tried it on with a belt and by itself  and i still feel like it's just a plain dress that i can get at a discount store. i'm a big fan of tracey reese and own a lot of her dresses  and i feel that this is the most plain dress she ever designed. size s regu"
0,I ordered a size 0. the dress was extremely large. i am 5'2 and weigh 110. i guess you really must be 5'9 like the model to wear this dress. such a shame..
0,I wanted to love these  but the zipper is extremely short and they were not flattering on my thicker thighs and large behind. the fabric is so soft  however and the color is great. would work on a less curvy woman!
-1,I ordered a size small (usually i am ps) but wanted the extra length. usually i can get away with a regular small but not this time. such a cute style but made me look short & wide. unfortunately it's going back
0,"This picture does not do this skirt justice. it is gorgeous. however  the waist was so small that the sequins dug into my waist making me think of a medieval torture device. unfortunately  it was the largest size so i can't size up. i'm 4'11"" so the length was perfect - it came to right above my knees. i love the skirt so much that i'm considering liposuction."
-1,I tried this top on thinking it would be cute for the summer. it looked more like a maternity top with the fullness in the bottom. so if you're expecting  this one would be great.
-1,I love my very old pilcro stet jeans. they are the perfect denim weight  and the back pockets are set in a way that is very flattering for the tush. not so with the newer pilcros unfortunately. the denim is thinner and may have more stretch and they get worn and pill on my inner thighs. and the back pockets are set far apart making my back side look unnaturally wide. it's a bummer.
-1,I was obsessed with this top. i ordered my normal 4 and was bummed about the fit in the shoulders. the slight puff was too far in  it didn't hit on my shoulder. so i returned it to a store and ordered a 6. it came quickly but it was still too narrow in the shoulders. i took it to the store and held it against the 4 and the seam was the same length between the neck and shoulder as the 4. both returned. i had no hope for an 8.
1,This is seriously a beautiful dress. it has such gorgeous colors. it's lined so no slip needed. it is flowy and just the right length. i went with a petite and it is perfect.. can't wait to use it at the beach.
-1,I love maeve and was so excited for this top which looked like an update from a last season favorite. unfortunately the fabric was stiff  it was tight in the chest and went straight down from there. returned.
1,I went to retailer for a pair of pants and walked out with this tunic in the blue motif and the pilcro cords in dark turquoise. this sweater  like the one i purchased last season by the same designer  is well made and the fabric is luxuriously soft (like cashmere soft). am so excited that the weather is finally cooling down to wear it!
-1,I love(d) this top. it was my go to top even in the heat  the fabric is light and breathes. however  pulled it out of the washing mashing to find that the sleeve has shredded away from the body. it could not be repaired. i am so disappointed as i really loved everything about it.
0,I loved this when i saw it arrive in the mail. as soon as i put it on though  i was drowning in it. i know its a cape and it is suppose to be large but it was so big i had to return it. i still really like it and wish it would have worked. i am 5'5  athletic/slim figure just for reference.
1,I love this dress  it's very comfortable  slim swing and very ingratiating. the fabric is light  i like the details of the buttons on the sleeves. overall  i'm pleased and happy for the purchase of this dress. i will definitely recommend it.
0,Love the feel and comfort
-1,I was really excited about this skirt because i love the color. however when i tried it on  it was too much of a high/low. i am not very tall but this would look a lot better on a tall person.
-1,The fabric is a nice weight knit and the top generally well made. unfortunately  the fit was enormous. i've an athletic build w/ big boobs & normally wear l in retailer tops.
0,Material is very thin  and although this is apparent in the design  i just didn't like the way the cuffed sleeves felt...
-1,I tried this dress on in store. i loved it online  but in person....not so much. it looked and felt like a cheap halloween costume. the fabric was bad. really bad.. the mustard color was beautiful.... boo
0,The colors of this top are perfect for spring  i love the embroidery and like the sleeves with the ties at the bottom. what i didn't like and primary reason i may be returning  is the elastic bottom. it cuts off at an awkward spot on my waist and makes my top section look short and wide. i am very disappointed about this  as the rest of the blouse is gorgeous.
1,This dress is so pretty- the colors are vibrant  beautiful pattern  the ruched part in the center hides the tummy!!! the neck line was too low for me  so had to wear a red cami underneath which hid the skin showing parts in the back around the waist. so instead of skin color  it was now red- even more prettier! no body could tell!! got so many compliments!!!
-1,I loved this shirt when it first arrived and i couldn't wait to wear it. after one day of wear  i went to hang the shirt back up and it was ripping on both sides of the middle back seem. this shirt was not tight on me at all. very disappointed.
1,"This dress is stunning! my sister-in-law was hoping to use it as a bridesmaid dress for her wedding and i ordered it for fitting purposes. it fit beautifully on my 5'10"" frame. unfortunately she decided against it due to availability and because of the length on the shorter bridesmaids. while it fell to a couple inches above my ankles  it made the shorter girls look shorter. i ended up returning it but am regretting not keeping it now!"
-1,Quality piece except the fit is way off. i have a 32 c bust and long narrow torso  larger on the bottom. i ordered the small. i frequently wear a small/extra small on top and i was busting out of this in the chest area. however  the fit then flares way out from the torso and it just looked dumpy and overpowered my 6 foot frame. i marked it as running small  which it does on top  but then it runs very large on bottom. wanted it to work  but didn't.
0,I ordered this on-line. while it fits well before washing  the fabric is a bit thin. i'm afraid it might shrink in the wash  too. i haven't worn it yet because i'm trying to decide it i will keep it or return it. colors are a bit more muted than i would like also.
0,This romper is extremely well made and the colors are even more beautiful in person.  however  i found it to run extremely short in the torso.  i couldn't get my arms through the sleeves after stepping into it without ripping the garment.  for reference i'm 5'9 with a slightly longer than average torso.  i ordered my normal size m.
0,It does run a little small. my regular 2 fit but snug. the colors were drab and the material felt like straw. the lining is really silky and nice. just didn't work for me .
0,I wanted to love this dress - it is gorgeous on the model  but unfortunately for me  it didn't fit right. i'm petite and ordered the xxs petite. it was snug in the upper body and looked like i was wearing a baby-doll dress. the material is high quality and i love the burnt red color. it just didn't fit right. definitely looks great on the model  but hung funny on me. i can see why it was highly rated  gorgeous dress - just not on me.
-1,"I wanted to love this top  but it unfortunately did not work for me. the material has a nice weight and feel to it  and while i love the pattern  the shape leaves something to be desired. the cap sleeves were a little tight on my arms  and the cut of the sleeves made my arms look big. the body of this shirt reminded me of a loose maternity top. for reference  i am 5'10"" 140 lbs and typically a size 6. i wear a small in retailer clothes  and got a small in this top. i think an xs would have been to"
1,The print is even better in person! true to size. flattering fit.
0,I ordered this top online in two colors  and kept the berry color. i liked it while trying it on. when i wore it an entire day  the top just didn't look that good. it wasn't flattering  and it focused on the bad areas despite being loose fitting. it didn't seem very flattering. i wore it for one day and am not happy with my purchase. i wish i could send it back but i already wore it. the fit just isn't very flattering. it is loose but focuses on the curves not in a good way if you are curvy.
-1,I look like i put a baggy bag over my head. also  the material really seemed like fake velvet to me.
1,This shirt is very flattering and drapes beautifully. i am 5'7 175 and the medium fits perfectly. i bought in navy but am disappointed in the other options - i would have bought all of them had they been nice colors but the yellow and orange are really garish and unflattering on any skin tone and the white way too see-through which ruins the visual lines of the top. bummer! but i wear the navy every day so give that a thumbs-up.
1,"Color  fabric blend  and pattern are even more beautiful in person! unfortunately  i wont be keeping this due to length. i am only 5'3"" and this top dropped only to about 2 inches below my navel. if you have a short torso  or like the short look  i would recommend this!"
-1,These could barely fit over my calf and did not even broach my knee. i have big calves but i am otherwise i slim and normal sized woman. these are way too tight and narrow to enjoy or to get much use out of.
0,"I really like the pattern and the cut of these pants. the fabric is nice  too. however  i was disappointed how much they stretched out the first (and only) time i wore them. i am 5'6"" and about 150 lbs. i ordered size 10; i am going to try to exchange them for a size 8 since they stretched so much."
0,"I have purchased many different styles of pilcro jeans  and have loved them all!!! these  unfortunately i do not like. i think they run large and the fit  just blah. the waist gapped and kinda had a ""mom jean"" look. i felt the quality was also not up to standard for this brand."
-1,I washed and dried this in my dryer after one wear and it shrunk to the size of a toddler shirt. i dried it on medium. i can not really wear it unless i want to show off my belly. i loved the color (lilac). fit  and style when i received it and immediately put it on. so sad about the shrinkage. for a $58 shirt i expected a bit more. retailer should suggest air drying the shirt. so bummed and disappointed!!!! i would not recommend this shirt unless you can remember to air dry it every time.
-1,Perhaps i should have gotten two sizes smaller  but the knees on these were baggie by lunch.  they are very soft and comfortable  but i wouldn't buy them again.
0,Cute top  not great on me. beautiful  bright color.
0,I don't love this skirt as much as the other reviewers do. it fits a little bit weird on me  and i wanted the tie to be adjustable so i could bring in the extra fabric a bit (the knot is not adjustable). the skirt is borderline tight around my rear and legs  so i can't size down. the knit is substantial  so that's something -- but i found the extra fabric around my middle just wasn't flattering on me. i had recently bought and loved lilke's tideline pencil skirt  which also has a fabric tie wrap
0,Love the dress and went a size up as recommended by other reviewers. but it was still too small. it's just not roomy enough in the chest--total boob squash. had to return it.
-1,Don't even waste your money  even on sale.    bought three in different colors because i loved the loose fit and airyness for hot southern summers. unfortunately  one of them ripped in the first wash. i let it air dry and thats when i found multiple runs and a hole that i could put my finger through. one of the other colors was fine  yet still pilled pretty bad. the third one still has the tag. keeping the one that survived the wash because i like the color - but will only be using it as a knock
1,The fabric is breathtaking  both the jewel tone colors and the burnt velvet that would flatter any skin tone. as usual  eva franco clothes run small so i went up a size  size regular 6 (i am 5ft2in  34b  26 waist  36 hips) fit well  the hem is below my knees  appropriate for work. but i think it would look better as a skirt or a sheath dress. the top part looks strange  does not enhance any curve and turns the dress to frumpy on short folks like me  thus one star off.
1,I absolutely love this jacket. as a 36 year old woman  i want items that are on trend but don't look juvenile. this jacket hits the nail on the head for me.
-1,"Got this in the sky color. returned it because the top is way too sheer for me  if you know what i mean. i wanted a pretty gown i can wear without a robe in front of my kids. no can do. also  for the price  material just felt flimsy & cheap. it does run small ~ the medium was good on me and i'm 5'2""  114#  34b"
0,Runs large and pocket detail is very prominent. wanted a crisper  trouser-like pant--this is not it!
-1,This shirt runs very large. i will be returning for a smaller size.
-1,It looks adorable in the picture... but just not flattering in real life. too much fabric in the skirt that flares from the waist in a bunchy  unflattering way. makes a slender but curvy figure look boxy  rather than enhancing curves. it's a pass. love the blue print  though.
-1,White and silver threads made fabric look grey. almost dirty. fit was nice and price is great. villa to pool to restaurant would be great. colored fabric would be better.
1,This dress is gorgeous!! amazing colors  drape and bra friendly if ur not too big chested. i can wear this w a strapless bra and the tie in back does work.
0,This top looks much nicer on the model than in-person. i tried it on  it didn't look flattering and was shorter than i like. in the picture i really like the top with the design and frills on the side  gives the model a waist. in-person the design doesn't stand out much and the frills look wrinkled.it is also sweatshirt material and a tad stiff. i am sending it back. it just didn't look as flattering. also  it seemed more fitted at the top than bottom.
1,This dress is very versatile. it is comfortable and very flattering. the armholes were not too big. you do need to wear a bra that crosses in the back if you do not want the straps to show. i purchased the red/pink color and it is very vibrant and not see through at all. the length is great as it is above the knee by a few inches  it accentuates the best part of the leg. it also can be dressed up with heels and jewelry or more casual with flatter shoes. it is a classic style  not trendy so it wi
0,"I really wanted to love this dress....     i absolutely love the fabric and the bottom of it. sadly  the top was just too ""balloon like"" and poofed out way too much. i tried putting a belt with it which helped a little bit. if the top had been just a little more fitted this would be awesome. i don't know if a smaller size would have helped the issue... i ordered a small and considered an xs but in the end just returned it."
1,Love this sweater but it's too large. will exchange for smaller size because i really want it.
-1,This dress hangs horribly. unlike the photo  the waist does not cinch. too bad. the colors are great and the quality of the material is nice. because i bought it on sale  i may try to tailor it to work  but unless you are willing to do that  its a no go. :-(
1,I bought this in my usual medium and it fits great (fitted at the shoulder  loose below). it looks great with skinny jeans and can be worn casually or dressed up with accessories.
1,I was pleasantly surprised with this one. fits a bit large. i'm 8-10  the 8 fits just right. the moss is a great staple color.
-1,I love eva franco   this is a very poor version ! bias seams are puckery... zipper is bubbled   felt great looked like fun but too much if a mess to be fixed.
-1,Appears much more sleek in the photograph. in real life  this shirt looks more like a pajama top. thin  extremely casual  not worth the price i paid- even in black. will be exchanging it tomorrow.
-1,Fun  sexy underwear but rides up in the front. will return
1,I bought this 'nightgown' to wear as a winter maternity dress. it really fit the bill!! the knit fabric stretched nicely as i grew but was still flattering before i got larger as well. there is no way i would actually sleep in this dress. it would be way too hot! it is cute with calf length boots and i look forward to rocking it without the belly next winter. i would normally wear a petite length and bought the medium and though it was longer  the length was not awkward and kept it from being to
0,I love this dress. the design is gorgeous. however the bust is extremely small. only someone in the a or b range will fit into their appropriate size. i am disappointed.
-1,This suit is absolutely gorgeous but it really will only fit a very short waisted gal. it fit perfectly in the body and in the bust but just was not long enough for me to lift my arms up and my size c cup boobs to not pop out. i was very sad to return it :( i am a size 8 with c cup boobs and ordered it in a medium
1,This tank is well made and the top part is doubled (partially) so you can get away without wearing a bra (if you wish). i'm 5'1 and tried on the standard xs in store because xxs was not available. it was a little bit longer on me than on the model pictured. the pin-tucked area fit well  not too tight or loose and the bottom part was flowy which i don't mind. i expect this top to shrink in the wash a tad which would make it perfect for me. i opted for the white vs. the black because i love the pi
1,This sweater looks just as pictured on the model. its very warm though even with cropped sleeves. i ordered a large and it was true to size but roomy. i liked this top very much but is thicker than seems. outer grey material isn't very pleasant & itchy  however the bottom portion is an underneath gown and attached to sleeves inside so its very soft on touch.
1,Tried these on several times in store and never bought them  but was able to get them with a 20% email- seemed like a better price for the product. the color is rust and a little odd for my wardrobe - wish they also came in black. love the style and they are very comfortable  perfect for late summer- can wear on errands or dress them up a little with shoes/accessories for casual dinner out. happy i finally purchased them!
-1,One of the worst shirts i've tried in a long time. i don't know how they managed to give it a little shape on the model. in person it is sleeveless  huge  short and wide.
0,I have mixed feelings on these. i ordered the honey which is a mustard color as shown in the picture. they are true to size  cute  and comfortable. i washed them the first time with a load of darks and the color ran onto other clothes. plus the pants looked a little streaked in some areas. i'm not sure if this was a bad lot  but back to the store they went.
0,If you look closely at the pictures this dress is shown 2 different ways. one with a lace covered v-neck and one with a rounded neck. which is it retailer? don't know about the size but i had to answer the question. i won't order the dress until i know exactly which style i'm ordering.
1,The saundra tank is a very pretty and feminine knitted top. it is soft and comes in a very delicate pink color.  i took this on a recent trip and it paired well with capri tights and wedges. it was very comfortable to wear having a medium weight to it. the only issue that i had was that the cut below your arms is very deep and made it difficult to hide the side of your bra. it is a rather loose fit  so if you prefer something more form fitting  you might opt for a smaller size.
-1,I'm 5'5 and 130lbs and i was swimming in the small. the arms are very boxy  the sleeves too long  and and it just wasn't a flattering fit at all. the color and design on the front are both nice. the sweater is made in china and very  very itchy. i own wool sweaters and wear them with layers  but there was no way this was going to be comfortable. very disappointed  especially given the price  but perhaps that's why there are so many left at the end of the season and on sale. this one is going bac
-1,This is an absolutely beautiful dress  but arrived with several holes in it!
1,"Beautiful sweater!! i love the color and the fit. the cowl neck isn't too tight and the sweater hangs away from the body without being boxy. it comes down to the low hip on me. very soft and cozy. i purchased the aqua in xs. fits perfectly and i'm 5"" 5' 127lbs."
-1,The cut of the bodice is very strange and unflattering. it is great quality  but designed poorly. returned it.
-1,I thought it would be heavier than it is. it's thin and more delicate than what i would expect for a winter sweater (it contains wool so not really suitable for spring/summer). it's also shorter than it appears on the model and a little wider/boxier too.
0,This is really a lovely jumper and looks quite nice and dressy on. my problem is a short torso  but then again this may be made for short torso loving people! i felt like i was all legs in it. i never asked anyone else's opinion  though  so not sure if its just me and my complex. if you don't have a short torso then you might experience the pulling the others were speaking about because the waist might hit you higher than your usual waist.  overall  i am not sure who this was designed for.. but
0,Beautiful detail and soft sweater. i ordered a medium and the toro so fit well but was short. arms were long and baggy in comparison. given the fit  i didn't think the small would work. really wanted this to work but unfortunately it is going back.
1,I actually saw angela from the tv show bones wearing this dress and decided i loved it so much i had to find out where it was from! after ordering this dress i couldn't be happier  i love it! it is a very flattering shape and a thick material so it falls nicely.
-1,I loved the idea of this dress and was hoping it would be worth the astronomical price tag for what really is a cotton jersey dress. unfortunately  this dress missed the mark. in the pictures this dress looks like the fabrics are navy blue and some sort of white. well  it is not white or whitish at all but baby pink! bright baby pink! even the light pattern on the navy background is actually pink. huge disappointment. my other issue is with the length of this dress. the description says that the
1,I just ordered this dress in blue on sale and it was such a bargain for the quality and look. it's a very comfortable dress that swings and flatters my body type  which is tall and thin. i think this dress would not work on a more busty woman's frame  but it definitely works for me. i'm 5'9 and 135 pounds and a small is plenty big (i often take a medium). i definitely recommend this dress.
0,I loved the fit  color and style  but the fabric seemed very thin and cheap. i was worried that it would tear easily. this is getting returned.
1,I bought three -- in part  because they were on sale. i do not think that i will ever wear these without a sports bra though. they are too low in the front and on the sides for a regular bra and too thin to go bra-less. that said  they may look cute with some of the lacy-show-me bras that seem to be trendy right now.     i am typically a small  and bought x-small. the drape is not that different in the two sizes  but the length of the straps was much less revealing in the smaller size.     all-i
1,I liked this online but loved it when i received it in the mail. i normally wear a m/l and the medium fit perfect. it is gorgeous and flattering with a tie at the waist. the bottom is flowy. i knew it would be sheer from the reviews so that wasn't a surprise but i really wish it came lined. no one wants to wear a slip to the beach and i feel it's too nice for a cover up.
-1,I am a 32dd  5'4'' and 125lbs and this top was way too baggy. it looked awful. this is shapeless and oversized. i would size down or just pass.
-1,I was excited to receive this top. it looked great online  vibrant colors with the beautiful detail on the sleeves. when i tried it on  the fabric looked and felt cheap. it is not a flowy top. do not recommend it.
0,"This has a cute aesthetic on the hanger but not so great on- at least for my body type. i am 5'10"" with broad shoulders and slim  and both the arms and dress length were too short. in addition  the size 8 was boxy and unflattering. sizing down to a 6 would have exacerbated the length issues."
1,Excited to get this sweater! i'm a 38c and usually wear a size 14 blouse so i ordered an xl as i don't like clingy sweaters. this was perfect; fitted but not tight. i'll be able to wear this with jeans and cute boots for lunches or nice slacks and heels for a dinner date. wish i could've gotten it for the 25% off + free s/h but glad i didn't wait - this size was sold out first.
1,Amazingly soft  thin and super warm! this a classy staple with an amazing swing fit and worth every penny!
0,The material is soft and comfortable and the top of the shirt fits well.  when it comes to the bottom part of the shirt there's a lot of extra fabric which makes it balloon out. it made me look much bigger than i am.  i ordered a large (normally i wear lg or xl) and it's possible a medium would have fit better. unfortunately this shirt had to be returned.
0,"I wrote item ran large  but that was true only in length. it would be long for someone 5'10"" . however the bigger issue is getting it on. the style and quality are quite nice  but it does have some issues."
1,Woke up this morning to an email from retailer showcasing this gorgeous jacket. i knew i had to have it. trying it on in the store  it did not disappoint! hei hei is a really wonderful brand  and me being a more plus sized gal  their sizing is always wonderful. i normally do an xl in most retailer jackets and tops ..but i was able to do a l well. the arms have plenty of room and the body of the jacket has a room as well (like your typical bomber would). the fabric is soft and the blush color
0,"Thick material and cute design. i am typically a size 2 and the small in this fit but was snug in the crotch and just zipped at the waist there is not much if any stretch. i am 5'6"" with a 26 1/2 in waist so that was unexpected. it does have cinchers at the waits but they are more for aesthetics than functionality. it is a very cute design and the fabric is nice as well as the direction of the stripes."
0,I really like the look of this dress  but i ended up returning it because it was too short. the shoulder area was also too big on me.
0,I wanted to love this skirt. i love high-waisted skirts and the length seemed flattering on the model; it was not so flattering on me. the fabric is so lovely--truly the photos online don't do it justice. it's heavy and luxurious  wonderful for fall or winter  and the gold  gray  and navy floral pattern is not too flashy or bold. plus  pockets! however  the midi length did not work for me  despite the product's suggestion that it was a universally flattering length  just above the knee. i'm not
0,This would have been a perfect jacket for a trip i'm taking  light weight and very stylish. however the jacket runs huge  the arms are long but it was the shoulders that were too big. i wear a size 8-10 mostly 10 in retailer clothes i ordered the large and the shoulder seam was about 2? past my natural shoulders. i won't return for a smaller size because the fabric being wool (i should have checked) its unbearably itchy esp around the neck  you could wear a long sleeve top and a scarf but then it
1,I tried this top on with a pair of white shorts  half tucked  and it looked really classy and nice. the fit was loose but flattering  it is a tiny bit sheer  but i was wearing a magenta bra  so perhaps i am biased. overall  i think this is a good basic addition  to a summer wardrobe  can be worn with a nice skirt  or with jeans as shown here. the 0 (or xs  can't remember) fit me at 115 lbs  with 30dd chest.
-1,So after reading the 2 reviews  decided to just order my usual size (26)  thinking they might be a tad snug. wrong! they were huge! i looked at the size to see if they sent me a size 30 by mistake! unfortunately small sizes sold out. quality is excellent as well as style  so bummed!
1,My stylist brought me the regular xs to try on in the store and almost told me i should buy it... the length seemed just fine  but i usually get petite so decided to order the xs petite before deciding... good decision  there is less fabric in the skirt  so it seemed anyway  so i am less overwhelmed buy the skirt. the cut is super flattering  and length was actually better (the longer sides hit  me around the knee). i wasn't sold on the dolor  as i have pale skin  but there is enough dark to com
0,I don't have the right body to pull this off. too many awkward styling issues (length  slits  tie  stitch quality) so this will have to go back. maybe if i was taller and slimmer this would be good. alas  it isn't meant to be...
-1,"When i unwrapped this a chemical ""stink"" hit me that amost knocked me over. it was really unbearable and i m not overly sensitive to smells. second it was way too large with a boxy unflattering cut. the waist sits very high at elbow height and every below the waist the material balloons out in a rediculous manner. i wonder if they had it pinned down somehow on the picture here. with a more flattering cut i might have decided to wash it a few times to get the stink out. i do not recommend this fo"
1,I love the look on this dress - feels great for a romantic night out or for a party.
1,I?m mad for plaid but usually for smaller pattern and winter colors. somehow  this top was love at first sight. it looks simple but it?s not. it?s unique in its own way (look at the back  the slightly puffy sleeves  the side slit)  and the colors are such a great mix that go with everything. the stylist opened up a couple of side buttons and tied the material to a knot  so cute. i purchased the xs and the fit is the same as shown online (i?m 5?2?  34b  26 waist  36 hips). i know the price seems
-1,I purchased this top in the rose and steel blue colors even though the majority of reviews says it shrinks even when you wash per the instructions. i called the local retailer store first to see if it could be returned if this happened and they said yes  no problem. well the reviews are correct. i washed just the rose colored top so i could compare it to the steel blue if it did shrink. i am returning them this evening. i will not take the time or spend the money to dry clean a tank. it is made ve
0,This sweater has potential  but it wasn't right for me. the collar isn't flattering on me...too thick  and my shoulders are already broad. my waist is high  so i need a longer look. the color is true to size  but it's s little see through...dark bra shows through.
0,I wanted to love this top! on me it was weirdly boxy. it was too wide and too short  and it was more sheer than i expected it. the fabric is lightweight but wrinkles really easy and loses shape pretty quickly. i also thought the fabric would be heavier and have more structure than it has. i love the scalloped detail at the arms but after about five minutes of wear this felt super crumpled and just kind of sloppy. unfortunately it will be going back.
-1,"So disappointed. i love retailer! this was a huge disappointment. i am 5'3"" and 120 pounds. when i put it on  all i could think was that i looked just like a clown due to the big cowl neck and how large and round the dress made me look. if i wasn't so disappointed  i might have laughed. this had to have been a design mistake. i've truly never seen something so unflattering."
-1,So thin and see thru it's not even wearable in public. extremely cheap and ill fitting for any price let alone this price. i feel like they will rip the moment i wear them out. going back.
0,I was excited about this - - such a lovely look online. but on me...it was just meh. i'm a little heavy right now so that could be playing into it...but i will say i loved the top part of the dress. very flattering and subtly sexy. but the bottom..it just hangs like a rag. it needs either more material for a swishier effect...or it needs to be a different material. or maybe knit just doesn't work on me in the form of a dress! the knit is nice but i kind of also feel like it is chintzy...i can't
-1,I had fallen in love with the coral dress that was somewhat like this one and came out a few months ago. but the problem i'm having with this one is the same problem i had with the coral one. they are all flawed in their construction! i had eventually tried 3 size 16s in the coral because each one was flawed. on one  one side hung longer than the other  and on all 3  the top design did not line up with the bottom design. this blue one is the same way! the top design does not line up with the bot
0,Ordered med petite. love the print & design but it runs really big more like a large and length of top is not flattering . returning
0,Those pants sit pretty snug on top and get very wide very fast. this looks odd in my opinion if you do not wear a tunic style top like on the picture. also the material is quite thin  which makes the snug part look unflattering. they were not for me unfortunately.
1,This was all wrong on me. the puffy sleeves made me look a foot wider. i'm thinking this will look good on tall slim ladies. it is extremely comfortable and the material is very pretty though. tts
1,"I am not a model shape but this dress looked so light and beautiful i had to try it. it wasn't available in my local store so i risked it and ordered online. i'm 5'6"" and about 175 lbs; the medium fits perfectly. i will say that the skirt fabric comes much more sharply pleated than it looks in the photos  maybe this hangs out/mellows over time. the lining to the knee is going to be great for warm summer days. can wear to work with a shrug and some flats or to a summer wedding. the pattern is bea"
-1,I was so excited to wear this shirt  even after reading the review that it curls up i decided to give this shirt a shot  and i found that the same thing happened to me. it also clings tightly to the body. i would not recommend this shirt for anyone with broad shoulders.
0,The fit on these is frustrating. with l space you almost have to try everything on first because the sizing is different from one cut to the other. i wear a 25/26 jean and a medium in this bottom still felt and looked too small.
-1,I wish i had read more of the reviews....but thought i would give it a try. the shirt doesn't seem as long as on the model but the armpits are sewn to hit mid shirt. this would be ok if it was the length pictured  but since it isn't it makes you look very boxy. i don't know if i ordered a size too big or if it is just the way the shirt was made. wanted to love for fall.....unfortunately  i am taking back.
-1,I tried this dress on in the store. i loved the fabric and color  but the fit was huge  no matter how much i sized down. there are full dresses and tunics that are supposed to be loose  but this was shapeless in an unflattering way. i was attracted to the style and color  but the execution left much to be desired.
-1,I wanted to love this dress  as the length  cut  and color are exactly what i've been looking for. but i was terribly disappointed in how thin and see through the material is.
1,It pills a little under the arms and picks up lint  but it's totally worth it. this is a fabulous sweater coat. i receive compliments on it wherever i go. so cozy  warm & delicious. not too hot to wear indoors either. it's breathable. love it. bought in green during black friday sale. highly recommend.
0,Already got a lot of compliments on the first day i wore this skirt. great fun shape  very flattering. however  the 2 panels were sewn using some type of hard/plastic thread which becomes very itchy when you sit down (you can literally feel it through the liner and i'm concerned that over time it might actually rip it). very poor attention to details...
1,I love this top. the design is flattering and the fabric drapes nicely. the length is perfect and can dress it up and down.
0,This is a very cute dress. it was perfect before i washed it. the problems i had after washing it was the outer cotton layer of the dress shrunk length wise while the inside black lining did not  so the black lining peeks out a good inch or two. and since the dress is shorter i can't really wear it without using biker shorts  especially for the back of the dress since it's shorter there and if i bent over you could see everything. i'm so disappointed in the quality because it is a very cute  ver
1,These culottes are beautiful! really pretty cerise shade with a nice eyelet pattern. they are only partially lined. the size small  my normal size  was falling off of me so i sized down to extra small which fit perfectly.
-1,"Three strikes and retailer is out for me! i am so disappointed. i really liked this dress and was looking for a fun  distinctive new shift dress. got it  tried it on  took it off  went back to look at the listing online...nowhere does it mention that it has a drop-seam in the shoulders. i guess you can see it if you zoom in closely on the image  but it's not mentioned in the text. who on god's green earth actually looks good with a drop-shoulder?! it hits every woman under 5'10"" right in the middl"
1,This tank is soft and flexible. great fit with wonderful material. very pleased.
1,Love this top! you can definitely wear this out with jeans or with dress pants for work. it can be dressed up or down  so it's very versatile. the red motif is a gorgeous color for spring and summer. received lots of compliments!
-1,Really unattractive shirt. nothing good i can say about it. horrible fit. i can't imagine this would look good on anyone.
-1,I was expecting a tee shirt  but the material is more of light sweater knit. in the end it wasn't the fabric that was the deal breaker...it was the fit. in my regular size it is too wide and boxy through the body. i also felt like the arms are too big as well. it's going back and i am not going to bother ordering it in a smaller size. it's a shame because the embroidery really is lovely.
-1,I agree with the previous reviewer that the length is not at all what is shown in the picture. much shorter than that. and while the overall detail of the skirt is very nice  the elastic waistband makes it look cheap considering the price...
1,As cute in person as the picture shows. good quality  worth the money!
0,I want to say that i love this fabric design  combining some of my favorite colors -- greens and neutrals. however  this just didn't work for me:  _______  pros:  - it does have a nice flow as others stated.  - pockets are a surprise touch for a silk dress.  - the slip inside is detachable.  _______  cons:  - as another stated  lots of wrinkles. it's the nature of silk unfortunately  which means more work for me.   - length is too short in front for my personal liking. trend of these high-low he
-1,This didn't work for me. it looks better unzipped. the piece made me look extremely top heavy  and i am by no means overweight  but i do have a larger chest on a small frame (36c  5 feet  115). honestly  it just made me look fat. the design is cute  but this is going back..
1,This skirt is so cute. the fix print is really nice. it's a great piece to add to the fall wardrobe.
1,"The perfect pair. i am 5'6"". 130lb  and ordered size 28  and it fits just right. it is a little stretchy  so molds to your shape. the legs are slender  but not too fitted. no stitching along the seems makes these jeans classy enough to work with a dressy shirt."
1,I do not know where to begin....this sweater exceeds my expectation! i ordered this along with the mes demoiselles fringed sweater and i thought that was the game stopper....as beautiful as that one is...this one made my mouth fall open. it is unlike anything i have. it is an oversized substantial chic piece that is all over the runways. not to mention the color that i can not stop staring at and it will go with everything! order your regular size as it is suppose to be big!
-1,I love the pattern adn color combo  but  wow t really flatering on me. too much fabric. i felt like i was trying to hide wight gain or pregnancy or wearing a mumu. anyway  not for me  but others might toll wnat to try in case it was just me... too bad.  length was decent in regulat size though  not too long. just too wide.
0,I looked forward to this dress.  it's a lovely design.  it's a heavy material that doesn't have the most flattering fit.  the green lace has snags along the hemlines which is a disappointment.  i'm returning the dress.
0,This dress is so so cute. i ordered an xs and it was a bit longer in person than pictured but that's an easy enough fix since i know a good tailor. the problem is that the dress isn't lined. it's made of thin  see-through cotton so it leaves nothing to the imagination. for the price of this dress i would have expected it to be suited for more than just a bathing suit cover-up. without a slip underneath it (if you can find a strapless one) it is unwearable in most social settings. it's such a sha
1,I wanted these leggings to wear under dresses during winter to keep my legs warm. they get the job done and for an incredible price. they are soft and lined with fleece on the inside. i'm not sure the ribbing on the black is necessary but it's subtle and i don't mind it. they are a tad long on my petite frame but since i intend to tuck them into boots  the length not a problem. my only quibble is that my first pair arrived with three snags on one leg. retailer kindly sent me a new pair for
0,I never write reviews
-1,I really loved this skirt on the model  but it just wasn't flattering when i received my order. i ordered two sizes - 2 and 4. i am 5'4  athletic build and the front closure made my waist look much larger than it is. the back of the skirt also flared out more than i expected it to.     sadly  i had to return both. perhaps this would look better on someone with a much taller frame.
-1,I ordered this after reading through the reviews. i realize the reviews were mixed  but thought i'd take a chance. unfortunately there were more things wrong than right with this dress. right: i loved the various colors (yes  it shows black but is actually brown). i also loved that it was lined and the lining was semi-attached to the dress  with the same hi-to-low hemline. wrong: as said by others  the sleeves were very tight! the dress is roomy and does swing but unlike the model  it isn't real
1,This dress is amazing! i love the collaboration with rifle paper. it has a nice boho swing look. i sized down from my typical small and took an xs. both fit well but i wanted the shoulders to be more fitted.
-1,I had high hopes for this top based on the photos  but when it arrived it is a very thin cheap feeling top. the color is a dusty rose color that has a yellowish mottle throughout it  almost like a tie dye or slub effect.  not pretty at all.
-1,Usually i really like deletta and know the sizing and shapes. this top looked pretty in the pics and i thought it would be a nice change from a tee. it was baggy  hung low and the layers just looked boxy and shapeless.
0,"I love the look of this dress but the length feels a little awkward which might be my height (5'4""). i'm thinking about having it altered  not sure if i will do that or return it. i love the colors and the back cut out  it may be a better length for taller individuals."
0,This sweater is incredibly soft and pretty  but there is just no way to get it to lay the way the model does in the picture. i found myself constantly tugging at the top to get it to stay off the shoulder - otherwise it just bunched up top and make a weird funnel neck. i really wanted it to work  but it was just so impractical.
1,Get this one during the 20% sale. if you dry clean it  you will have it forever!
-1,"I second that above review who states ""worst blouse i've ever ordered"""
1,I purchased all 4 of the color/pattern offered. all fit beautifully and have washed up great with no shrinkage with line dry. the only pair i had retuned were the blue motif because they were made from a very different material with not near as much stretch and felt much smaller to me and not as comfortable. the pattern was cute and may work just fine with those who have a different build. i felt these were in general true to size. no doubt i will wear these all winter! thanks antro!!
0,This dress is stunning.  it is a great classic  that i wished had worked out for me.  i went through 3 different dresses  and each time  the cap sleeve would tear.  there is not much room  if at any for arm movement without the fabric tearing.  i am so disappointed.  it wasn' even tearing on a seam (so there was no way to repair it).  if you do not intent to dance in this dress and are wearing it for a low key night or dinner  it would most likely work....it is not for a wedding with dancing!
1,"I cannot say enough good things about this dress. as a petite person (5'0)  it is so hard to find things that fit well without alterations  but this dress fit perfectly. it's also so well-made: the fabric is soft  comfortable  and gorgeously detailed  and the dress is lined which makes it feel durable and gives the skirt some volume (in a good  flattering way)! i got it shortened by about 2""  but this dress fits like a dream."
1,This top is so flowy and has a great fit! i can see wearing it lots of different ways. it could definitely be dressed up or dressed down.
-1,The tank looks nothing like the one pictured  mainly because it's tissue-paper thin. also  i ordered it in two sizes - xs and s as it can be hard to tell which one will fit. i started with the xs and quickly discovered that it ran large. the armholes hit halfway to my waist. obviously i didn't even bother opening the size s. both will be returned.
-1,This is a gorgeous top. very well made with a classy design. it fits true to size from the lower chest up. however  at about the mid-belly range  the shirt widens out and basically allows a 5 month twin pregnancy to comfortably fit in. size xs. i was so sad. for the price  i can't justify taking it for alterations. it would have been the perfect top.
1,I just bought this dress today  and it is absolutely stunning. it looks so much better in person than on the model. i think it runs true to size  however it does have relaxed fit. overall  the dress has nice quality fabric and nice flow  without adding bulk. great buy!
0,"I really  really wanted to love this jacket. unfortunately  i have a long torso and it was a weird length on me. it hit touching my waist and i wanted something a little longer. i am 5'6""  but long waisted. this probably fits beautifully on someone more short-waisted or petite in stature. it was beautiful (although the buttons were cheap...)"
1,I already have some dresses similar to this  but i couldn't help getting this one  too. i love the flowers  bees  and ladybugs on the print! there is some shimmery beading on the neck and a few spots. i think i can wear this at work with the right cardigan/jacket  so i'll get more use out of it. it's a lovely light  floaty fabric that's nice for warmer weather.
0,Good structure and quality; a bit large and wish i had ordered something a bit brighter! (i ordered the white tee.)
0,The fabric is super soft and the grey is pretty  but it is light grey not dark grey as described when you select to buy it. my biggest issue with the top is that the cold shoulder arm reveals the entire arm  so if you aren't completely toned with your tricep and all over arm  it will show... which is why i bought this to hide my blunders
1,"I bought this dress for my upcoming rehearsal dinner in early fall. i love the romantic lace and ivory color for the occasion. i ordered my typical size 10. it hits me right where it does on the model and it fits well on top  but the dress ""bells"" more than the images let on. i didn't want to size down in fear that the neck would be too tight  so i took it to an alterations specialist to get a lot of the lace fabric trimmed off. she took it in a little at the waste and the underarm  and hacked q"
0,"This jacket is beautiful. the color is so nice and the cut of the jacket is perfect. however  one i put it on  i couldn't wait to get it off. it's so itchy!! i tried putting on a long sleeve shirt under it but was still uncomfortable. especially around my neck. i wouldn't recommend this jacket based on the material alone. also  the jacket runs large. i'm 5'1"" 130 lbs 34d and i ordered the small. i would definitely size down."
0,"I ordered this skirt hoping i could wear it to work as it looked tailored on the model. this skirt is made from a heavy material but flares out. it is a whole lot of skirt! i'm 5'2"" and short waisted it looked like i was getting swallowed up.  i love the colors and design but it just overwhelmed me. it would work on someone taller."
-1,"I loved the print and fabric of this dress when i first saw it  but trying it on was a very different story! the photo seems to show a wider  more well-defined waist  with just a small amount of ""blousing"" on top  but this was not the case. yes  the waist fit  but it is a narrow band that was covered completely by the hanging over of the ill-fitting top  turning the entire look into a shapeless and very unattractive fit. sadly  this is going right back!"
0,I'm not sure i recommend this shirt but i did purchase the plum yesterday. i'm always always a m and had to size down to an xs on this one. that's how large it was! even the xs had plenty of room; i'm 5'6 145 lbs 36b for reference. the material look like it will stretch out even further but i got it anyway. it was on sale plus 25% off and for that price i can use it for casual days on the weekends. it's comfortable on and loved the lace detail.
1,Overall this is a great shirt. the material is soft and a little sheer  but not sheer enough to have to wear something underneath. the only negative is that the v sits a little high so i felt like i was constantly pulling the shirt down through out the day.
1,Love this top. work appropriate and dress down worthy. i also like the fact that it is not clingy around the waist. comfortable fabric.
1,Love to just throw on this shirt with whatever accessories and skinny jeans. easy to wear and very comfortable
0,I wanted to love this top- the pink color is wonderful and vibrant. however  like many tops lately  it is short waisted and ended up looking a bit boxy. i am 5'8 and found it about 1-2 inches too short.
1,I really like this sweater. i would suggest ordering a size up. i could had worn my normal size but a size up was much more comfortable. i have a burnt orange skirt that i wear with this and it makes the flowers pop.
0,"I really wanted to like this dress. i am 5'3"" 125 lbs and this dress was about 4 inches too long. the hem created a puddle around my feet. i've bought other maxis from retailer without this problem. sadly it went back to the store."
0,This top has gorgeous embroidery  very very nice  looks good in both wine and grey. it runs large. i kept it around not sure whether i should keep it. i usually wear xl  i ordered l and it still was loose at the bottom but fitted at the top. i have a big bust  and the embroidery ended at the top of my bust making the entire look unflattering  because the bust juts out in a strange way below the embroidery. the arms also tend to look wider due to the style. i don't like the fit at all.
1,Super cute and comfy  perfect for fall and winter (apre ski!). great with skinny jeans or leggings and ankle boots.
-1,I wanted to love this dress  it looks beautiful on the model but it isn't the flattering  even on sale i am not sure if it would be worth it  it it runs pretty big.
-1,So i'm not sure if its just my body type or what  but this did nothing for me. the bottom  which i thought would be too big was actually too small in both the small and the medium (i'm a size 8 bottom) and then when i sized up to the medium it was still too tight and then the top was loose. i just think this one is going to take the right body type. it could look really beautiful on the right person  just not me.
1,This dress is amazing. nice material  comfortable and really flattering. slightly tight in the arms but otherwise perfect. highly recommended!!!
-1,I couldn't wait to try this on this sweater.  sadly  it was too large in all ways.  the sleeves are adorable  but the ruffle overwhelmed my arms. this was much longer on me than the model.  it stopped mid-thigh.  the quality seemed fine  but it is a thin sweater.
1,I had been on a white jeans hunt for some time. pilcro is one of my favorite brands  and i can buy online with confidence knowing they will fit. if petite had been available  that would have been better in length  but it was not so i had them hemmed.
-1,"I ordered this in the ""plum"" color  which in real life just looks like a very  very dark brown. that would probably be okay  but the dress is actually about 3 inches shorter than the listed measurements. i ordered the regular length  but the shortest part of the hem hits me only about halfway down my thigh...way  way too short. i am 5'5""  for reference. lastly  i think the fabric is just awful quality  especially for this price point. the slight texture makes it want to cling to itself - worn ou"
0,The pattern and fabric on this dress are very nice. there is just too much fabric. it's much too baggy but could make a nice maternity dress. i'll be returning it.
-1,I got this in a l  and probably i am a m. however  the waist pretty much fit  but the bodice was baggy in a really bizarre way. i don't think a human could actually be shaped a way that would fit properly in this dress. this dress is well suited for a woman with a very large bust  but a small waist.
1,I just received this jacket in the cream color. it is so cute! you can change it from 3/4 to full length sleeves. i ordered both an xs and s and kept the s after i saw that i could cinch the waist to fit better. in the picture it looks a bit boxier than it really is possibly because not cinched. the material is good quality and the jacket is complete with attention to detail from the buttons to the jean contrast pull on the zipper. i love this jacket! it is a good cross over from athletic to cas
1,This dress is perfect for any occasion  it looks great with every shoe and is flattering on.
1,This cardigan is utterly gorgeous. way prettier on than i feared. my only issue is it felt a little itchy in the arms  and so i finally looked closely at the tag. the tag says the *back* section (which looks exactly like the weave on the arms) has a measly 5% wool snuck into the fabric content. why  retailer? why wool? i am so sensitive to it! my eyes have been demon red and itchy all day  classic symptoms that led to my getting rid of anything in my wardrobe with wool in it.  now i have a problem
0,Simple cotton garment such that the price seems high. if it had fit perfectly there is a chance i would have kept the dress  but my normal size 6 was a bit large and even though it was size petite  also to long in the upper body. perhaps a 4 p would have fit  but it may have then been too small. puzzling for petite to be too long in upper body. love this shape dress and the color and pattern however.
-1,Fabric much heavier than looks in picture. also nothing mentioned in the description. great color and fit but i live in florida.
0,I purchased this for a very good price and i typically love maeve... should have been a win-win. the fabric is thin and slinky in the most unfortunate way. it made finding appropriate undergarments very difficult. i had to add a slip (that helped) and figured that since i'm losing weight  it would look better when i'm down a few more pounds. that being said  i didn't find it to be figure flattering. i have a tummy and there was at least one photo from the bridal shower i wore this to  where i lo
1,Perfect fit and i've gotten so many compliments. i buy all my suits from here now!
-1,As others have said  this is cropped  so will look funny with most pants that aren't high waisted. i'm going to try it with a few dresses before i return it. the lining is adorable  so i don't want to have to send it back.
-1,Really wanted to love...but...the way it fit..lower part a tad too flowy...almost maternity like to hide a belly and the top area feels like my chest is being smushed! despite my bra size being a modest 36b...the look it gave was square on top almost block like with bottom that had flare...such a pretty top unfortunately the overall design just didn't work me.
0,I so wanted to love this dress  but the bell sleeves were enormous! if you're standing completely still with your arms down they look cool  but if you move your arms at all it looks like you have wings. the rest of the dress was beautiful  though  and a flattering swingy shape even on an hourglass/pear shaped figure. i would recommend sizing down  as the dress runs large.
1,One of the best maxi dresses i have ever found! i needed a dress that could accommodate a large bust (36g) and camouflage my postpartum belly. the dress did it all. i ordered the large (5'7 and 155 lbs) and it is so flattering. it has just the right amount of coverage up top to prevent looking too busty. and the band around the midsection makes me look much slimmer. like i said  best maxi dress ever. price is pretty high  but it was worth it!
0,This top was quite voluminous when i purchased it and i sized down to an xs  however after hand washing it once in cold water it has shrunk significantly. it still fits  but something to be aware of.
1,I tried on almost every dress in the shop today  and this is the dress. as soon as i tried it on i started twirling around. i felt beautiful and i couldn't stop smiling. my mother said that it makes my blue eyes glow. it flatters my figure by hanging perfectly across my bust-line  floating over my curves  and camouflaging my little unappealing bumps. also  the dress is cut nicely under the arms which allows coverage for a strapless bra. i chose the medium size even though i usually wear a large
1,I loved the layered look without all the bulk. the different textures make it so interesting.
0,I found the fit of this dress to be true to size with a flattering bust and waistline; however  the fabric feels cheap and doesn't drape as nicely as i'd hope for the price. this would be a lovely dress in a better quality fabric. for sizing reference  i'm 5'5''  122 lbs  30dd  and took my usual size xs - though i'm busty for my size  the top provides nice coverage.
-1,I wanted to love this shirt. the fit was a little off and i wish it had come in a little at the waist to be more figure flattering before it flared out. the fabric is nice but wrinkles easily and in the white is see through.. sadly i will be returning.
-1,"This jumpsuit looked so great on the model  and looked so hideous on me. i'm 5'4"" and in great shape  and this jumpsuit looked absolutely ridiculous....not to mention it rode right up my backside in the worst possible way. i'm so disappointed!"
1,This is a classic! not only is it reminiscent of a fun 60's swing dress but the perforated outer layer over a solid shift creates this modern edge to a reto style!!! love it!
1,I just bought these in store. so great looking. however  i bought the petites and they are still incredibly long. like 6 inches too long. so  i'll hem them  though based on the review that mentions shrinking  i might wash them first to see what happens. great for summer in the city.
0,"I like this shirt  as in general i prefer more form-fitting and less flowy shirts. however  after washing the shirt and hanging dry it has shrunk to be too short to wear with even mid-rise jeans. so: good if you don't like long t-shirts  bad if you are tall  like me (5'8"") and don't want to wear a crop top."
-1,Man  this dress is the worst. i don't understand how it looks the way it does on the model. agree with previous reviewer - there must be a minimum of 200 pins pulling the waves and waves of extra fabric back. this dress looks so cute   but is so  so  so disappointing in person. sweater collar and cuffs - stiff and bulky. dress - billowy and sack-like - not sure how they got a belt to pull it all in. save yourself the return and do not get sucked in by the sale price and extra sale discount like
-1,I'm not really sure what the designer was trying to accomplish with this dress. the fabrics and details are pretty but the shape is really strange. for one thing  the dress has a very straight cut so there is not a lot of room for movement and the thin belt makes the shape even worse. i felt like i was wearing a really fancy garbage bag. also  the way the bottom flares out is just strange considering the cut and length. i really wanted to like this dress but unfortunately it was a complete miss
0,This shirt is beautiful and so soft. it would have made a wonderful long-sleeved tee except for the fact that it was so low cut. the only way this is wearable is with a tank underneath which  for me  defeats the purpose of this type of shirt. i am rather busty (34 dd)  so maybe if you are smaller on top you might could pull it off.
1,This jacket is well-made and smart looking. it gave me just the boost i needed today at a difficult meeting. thank you retailer!
-1,I bought these in the mustard color and the salmon color.  i didn't have a problem with general fading  but used natural  mild stain remover (biokleen) and the pants were ruined. one faded where i sprayed and the other has a permanent water mark.  cold wash and line dried. such a bummer that these pants aren't every day wearable and washable!
1,Great sweater. cozy and thick. the bands at the waist and wrists help keep this sweater in place. the loopy knitted fabric adds a bit of texture to the gray which makes it a little more exciting than your average gray sweater. i got a small and it fit perfectly.
0,As another reviewer mentioned the quality isn't here.  they pilled in the thighs after wearing once and stretched out so much at the end of the day i was pulling them up constantly.  such a bummer because i love this brand.
1,I bought this in blue and have worn it with jeans  khaki shorts  and camo pedal pushers. added just a perfect amount of feminine detail without being over the top. i'm loving that it shows off my shoulders (they're tan from my vacation and i've been working like a fiend on my arms in the gym). it's well made too!
-1,Whatever happened to sizing! pretty print and color but has enough fabric for 2 tops. it is also unlined which is not a huge issue. i wore it with a cami. the arms weren't too gaping for me  thankfully. i tried to make it work with a wide belt but i will have to get it tucked on the sides. i am 140 lbs and got the small. should have gone 1 or even 2 sizes smaller.
0,I only gave this three stars due more to personal preference than to any real flaws with the product. it is very comfortable and for a jersey-style shirt quite warm. but that is one of my issues with the shirt. i wanted to wear it well into spring and i think it'll be just too warm. (i live in the northeast) i also felt that while it fit tts it had a more generous fit than what i expected  which was another negative for me. i wanted it to be more fitted to my body. however  i did keep it because
-1,It's way more distressed than it looks in the picture and that was a no for me.
0,This sweater has a fun big bold flower and a nice blue color and is quite roomy. the fit is larger around the arms and chest  which might work well for people who are very curvy on top. it seems to taper a bit to the waist. the roomy fit to the arms gives it almost a bat wing shape. it was too overwhelming on my petite frame  what with the bold flower and the fit  so i passed. but if you like the big flower and color and want a roomy sweater  this could work well for you.
-1,I purchased this shirt in white and black. the white is more ivory-isn  and is a bit thin/see through. the shirts can be worn with jeans  or dressed up with a skirt. i just wish it was a little more form fitting. i do like the hint of stretch in the fabric! very comfortable as well!
0,This top has a lot of potential (comfortable  easy to wear) but it's cut too small in the area above the bust. i tried the top in small  medium and large (i usually wear s or m in retailer tops) and couldn't get that area to not look tight or like it was pulling. you can see it on the model  too -- that space right above the bra near the armhole. i think you'd need to order a size up to get that space to work but then the top will start to look too big on the bottom.   i tried the green in the sto
-1,If you like to wear lampshades this is the shirt for you. beyond unflattering. boxy and seriously looks like lace was stitched to the bottom of a lampshade
1,I couldn't believe the bargain price of these leggings  so i took a chance and ordered all 3 colors. when they arrived  i was equally pleased to see how soft  cozy and warm they were and how nice they looked with all my oversized tops. also interesting is that the textures of all 3 are different. the black has a vertical lined texture  the lavender has a cable weave texture and the gray is untextured. wearing them is going to be a pleasure!
0,I purchased this top in white and lavender. the white is very nice  soft and semi-sheer but not completely see-thru (fine with a nude bra). it is a swingy fit and slightly longer in back than front  but i expected that. i purchased a medium and it's plenty roomy. i am usually between a medium and large in retailer tops so i would consider it tts for a very relaxed fit.   the lavender fits slightly looser and the hem is really uneven. it looks in some of the photos like this might be intentional  b
0,This top is really beautiful. the color is rich and the texture on the back is a unique touch. and i think it might have worked for me except that i could only find a m/l and it was just too big. i love drapey styles and think this top would have been just the right amount of drapey if i'd been able to snag a smaller size. but the m/l looked like a teal sack  so it's going back.
0,I totally agree with the first review. i thought this was soooo cute on the model  but it's loose fitting and has no shape to it.
0,I am somewhere between a 24 and a 25 (i have narrow hips but an average waist)  so i was happy to find that these worked for me in me in a 0. i loved the blue color as an interesting neutral. they did stretch out a little with wear  but i still felt like i looked good by the end of the day. i typically really like cotton/linen blends as i can usually wear them out of the dryer if i'm going for a casual look - a few wrinkles with linen doesn't bother me. but these. oh my. when i pulled them out o
-1,This dress runs so large  why did they not make an extra small. the material and detail are great the flow in the back is different but is flattering. i wish wish that they made this in the extra small  i was swimming in it  there was no way to fix it so it went back
-1,It was very pretty but it ran very big   sadly i had to return it.
0,I feel the same way about this shirt as i do about the sungarden tee. it's a lovely pattern and i like the fit (it's not clingy)  but it's a bit see-though. it's not as bad as the other tee  but no contrasting or patterned bras can be worn with this shirt (unless that's your thing). that said  i'm happy with it because it's a soft and pretty shirt that will get a lot of wear in warm weather. i am very glad i got it on sale though. i wouldn't have paid full price for it.
-1,I love maeve but this shirt's quality was poor and it was not worth the price. i would not recommend buying this online. you really need to try the blouse on in the store to make the decision as to if its worth purchasing or not...... and in my case this is being sent back.
0,I was really excited to receive this caftan  but it looked very strange on my body. i have small shoulders and the xs was still very big on me. there's also a seam along the sides that made me look boxy. the quality is really great  but i thought that the color seemed a tad bit darker/muted than pictured.
-1,Beautiful color  design and fit.  but i couldn't wait to get it off.  i don't have sensitive skin and don't recall ever putting a jacket on that felt like steel wool.
1,I am usually a small sometimes medium. purchased a small and want to wear it off the shoulder but it is too tight and the fabric is scratchy. it is a crepe fabric and although beautiful the hand of the material is not for me.  confused if i should return or get a medium as the look is very cool.  i wish this had been linen or some more natural material but still recommend it as a good buy
-1,This dress is so short! i double checked to make sure i didn't get a petite by mistake.  i'm 5'10 and ordered an extra small because of the deep v neck. it fit well on top  but  you could see my underwear in the front. seriously  i dont even think miley cirus would wear it that short. the lace was really beautiful so i was disappointed that it didn't work out.
1,I actually ended up buying two of these dresses. i took the first one to the dry cleaner and they chewed up the slip and put a hole in the dress. i was so sad that i went and bought a second one before they could sell out. the good news is that it was on sale! this is an awesome light and airy dress that is great for those hot summer days. i pretty much wear it every opportunity i get. for reference i purchased the small. it's loose but the shoulders  armholes and slip all fit perfectly. i weigh
-1,This top was originally way overpriced. so i ordered it on sale for half price. still overpriced. it arrived yesterday and frankly i am disappointed. the quality is not great. it is like a jersey type material. doesn't look like the photograph at all. i like the color  but frankly  that's about it.
0,I love this top and the beading is beautiful  but just like everyone else  it was way too large. i normally wear a lg  but the large looks and feels like a 3xl. beautiful but large
1,The fabric is lovely and the straight leg cut makes these pants a great option for summer. they do run small.
0,"I am 5' 10"" 135 lbs  normally a size 4l and ordered both a small in the navy and a medium in the beige. the elastic waist on both is not a tight/ muffin-top producing elastic like on some thinner banded leggings. in fact  the elastic is very loose  not very stretchy on either of the sizes. i think the s had been previously tried on  given the state of the packaging and the fact that the seat of the pant was already a bit stretched out. the m is definitely too large so i would say that these run"
0,This dress was cute but the fit was not quite right. the bottom half fit well but the top half was a little loose. it was wearable but i was worried after wearing for a few hours it would stretch out even more and look frumpy. like other reviewers have said  this dress really needs a belt to bring it together. i ended up returning it because i didn't love it.
0,This sweater is fine for the casual days. i bought this in cream and i have to say after one wash it looks old. i'm a huge retailer lover and buy a lot of clothes from them. this is just not the best quality and looks tired after a few wears. very soft  but poor material. not my favorite purchase.
1,These pants are adorable. i am a petite lady with a small waist and have a hard time finding pants that fit and look good  but these do. they are both cute and elegant. and they have pockets. i have had many compliments. the one drawback is they need dry cleaning.
1,This skirt is really beautiful and well made. the color is a cream/off white like other reviewers mentioned. it fits mostly true to size--i have a straight build with a wider stomach and no hips and my usual 4 fit a tad tight in the waist but perfect in the hips. i just love this skirt.
1,I purchased this top in the store  intending only to go in and return two tops i purchased on sale that did not fit. i had been looking for a red top to wear with navy  and this one couldn't have looked more perfect on the hanger. from the front  it looks pretty traditional  but the back is just gorgeous! the multi-colors and the pleating give the top a lot of interest and depth. the fabric is also super soft and comfortable. the top does run quite large  though  as i purchased an xs and still h
0,I was so excited to find this dress in the store! i immediately headed for the dressing room to try this beauty on....what a disappointment. the fabric is stunning  but the fit is extremely voluminous . i am normally a small to medium  so i grabbed a small......the only way to describe this dress is tentlike!  it was huge from the waist down. i don't think i could size to an xs because i am a 34d and the top half of the dress fit perfect!  i was sad to leave the store without this dress.
1,"Not my typical sleepwear  but glad that i took a chance  as it is super cozy for lounging. i was worried about covering my bottom (as i purchased the matching leggings)  and ordered s based on prior reviews. ended up exchanging for xs as it was too oversized. could have purchased the petite probably as xs is still a bit long (5'2"")  though fits like in photos."
0,This top is a nice color and soft material  but is much more of a swing top style than i was looking for. i will return it  but it could be ideal for someone who wants a very loose fitting casual look.
0,"The shirt looks a lot less fitted on the model in the picture than how it fit in ""real"" life. size was not wrong  the material was just very clingy. i was not impressed and subsequently returned it."
1,"Fyi the neck does have a hook and eye closure so there is room to get it on and off. the fabric is not stretchy. the lining is a nice navy. however  the sleeves are not lined. the cut outs have a beautiful blue lace behind it. it hit me at my waist. i'm 5' 3""   118#. i loved this top. worked with a pair of the new essential skinny trouser by retailer  and the nansen pointelle cardigan in yellow. this also paired well with a pair of rust colored skinny pilcro with a long necklace."
-1,This top is huge! i'm typically a size 2 or 4. i bought the 2 and its huge. it's wider than it is long. even if i sized down to a 0 it would still be too much fabric. i'm so disappointed! beautiful color and fabric but there's so much fabric. i love a flowy top but this one is way too much. :( i will be returning this top.
-1,Cute  but very itchy! have to wear a long sleeve tee underneath!
1,I love this top! although it is a tad big  i expected this because the moth brand usually does run a tad big. however  i am still able to wear it without any nerves that it's too big.... hope that makes sense! the navy was more lovely with my skin + hair  but the yellow was so pretty too!
-1,It's beautiful  lovely quality  gorgeous bird. but the fit just doesn't work for me. i'm usually a medium  which is what i got  it's just too tight in the chest. for ref 36d. as is it already flares out some in the bottom so i'm not gonna bother w a larger size unfortunately
-1,I bought this in size xl. it is so much bigger than i expected. there are panels of material. it really is huge. not flattering at all. still  i kept it. the material is so soft & flowy. i've gotten good use wearing it around the house  doing chores  resting  etc. i wouldn't wear it out doing errands. but  around home  it's perfect for feeling cozy. such a strange cut. i don't know who would look good in it since it can look sloppy. i think many would enjoy wearing it at home.
-1,I like the design of the dress  but the fabric makes it look cheap. for an expensive dress  i had expected better quality.
0,I really  really wanted to take this home with me but decided against it. from the front this dress looks amazing when it was belted and i love the colors in it. however  it bunched like crazy in the back. i tried it without the belting and it just hung like a sack and was completely unflattering. if there were some way to get rid of the bunching in the back then i would have taken it home. but with the cost of the dress  i can't justify taking it to a tailor so it stayed. sigh. so close.
-1,I ordered this since it looked so cute on the model . when i it arrived  i was excited to try it on  but when i did...blah. the color is murky and the top runs large  not to mention that the material is too heavy for a short sleeved top (plus it's lined). i really wanted to like it and debated wetting it and then putting it in the dryer to shrink it a bit. in the end  i decided that it wasn't worth it. too bad  as the concept was a good one. it just failed in the execution.
1,I sat on this top for about 2 weeks waiting for more reviews to see if it was worth buying.  i finally took a chance on it and i'm glad that i did.  this top is really cute.  i love the asymetrical pattern.  it's long enough that it goes great with my black skinny jeans.  the v neckline is perfect...not too low.  i got this in my usual size large and it fits perfectly.   i wish that the sleeves were slightly longer  but that shouldn't be a problem for someone not as tall.  it's a quirky and ador
1,This skirt is gorgeous!! drapes beautifully & the color is vibrant! get it!! you'll be so pleased! i sure am!!!
1,Love the coral color - so pretty in person. it is slightly lower cut on the chest than i expected.   this is a great top for the weekends!
0,I was disappointed with this dress because it is not the usual retailer quality. the quality of the material is not very good. i've bought boiled wood jackets from this brand before and they're very soft and very well made  hence my disappointment. i agree with the other reviewers in that this dress runs very large and the length is short for a winter dress.
0,"I love the style and color of this jumpsuit. i ordered a petite  and with tall shoes  it's still about 3"" too long. the side seam needs to be taken out at the bottom to hem it  so that's a pain in the rear.   also  this has a side zipper  but you step through the neckline to put it on. if any part of me was even a tiny bit larger  this would never work.   the biggest issue is that it armholes/bust gaps a lot. there should have been a dart from the armhole down towards the bust. i'm hoping to be"
0,"I tried this on in white and considered whether or not i wanted ""just another cover-up"". in the final analysis  even at $35 (30% off 49.99)  it just hung there. if that's what you're after  then this is for you."
1,I knew i needed to have this shirt as soon as i saw it and luckily for me  it was already on sale. i read the other reviews and ordered a s (usually order xs or s  but went with s for this one because i was worried about the fit of the bust). overall the shirt is huge on me. i considered returning for an xs but suspect that would also be too big and maybe too short. i decided i could get it tailored instead for the cost of exchange shipping. so i will be doing that. otherwise i love everything a
-1,There was nothing i liked about this coat. it was definitely not designed with a chest in mind. the pins on the straps were already coming off the first time i tried it on. i usually like oranges too  but even this color turned me off.
-1,I am so sad i have to return these leggings. they're adorable--so much so that my fiancã© commented favorably on them--but as other reviewers have pointed out  there's no elastic or string in the waistband so you have to walk around holding them up with one hand or they'll fall down! why  sleeping on snow? whyyyyyyyyyyy? they're so great otherwise!
1,This shirt is just precious! i cannot wait to pair it with a pair of white skinny jeans and wedges in the spring. i'm so in love with it. the detail is just beautiful.
1,I loved the mustard colored version of this skirt for summer and was thrilled to see it reissued in darker hues. same comfortable fit and cool textured fabric that doesn't wrinkle. i found the regular sizing to still be above the knee and the wide elastic waistband great for either a cropped top or a belt. will wear often.
0,I found the dot print in the store and though the pattern was cute  but when i tried it on i just had to wonder - who actually looks good in this style? it fits like a sack  big and puffy in the middle but tapered at the hem. it creates the exact opposite on an hourglass shape. genuinely puzzled that anyone would look good in this style. to bad  i hope they use these cute colors and prints on a style with some waist-definition next time.
1,Perfect except a little snug around the hips. very forgiving silhouette.
1,Love this crinkle cotton top for spring. the print is great and i can't wait to wear it!
0,I ordered a size 4  my usual size is a 4 or 6. the tunic fit well through the torso  but the arm length was too short and hit just below the elbow. the sleeve interfered with arm bending and moving. i have petite proportions so the arm length of regular size garments is usually too long. i don't want to go up in size because the body of the tunic might be too roomy.
-1,The shirt is very big. it would be cute as a maternity shirt.
-1,I was excited to see these jeans since they came in petite sizes and had a short inseam... unfortunately after ordering/returning several pairs  i found out that these are actually not petite jeans. please beware that if you are ordering these for the shorter inseam  they are actually 28 in... not 24 in as in the description. other than the inseam issues  they fit like typical paige denim.
1,This is a precious! it's a little thin  as i prefer a thicker fabric. however  wearing a tank top under it works perfectly. i have it now in both colors! great price on sale!
1,This cardigan is so fun to wear. you can wear it like as it is shown on this model or turn bottom up and wear upside down as tag suggestion.
0,I ordered this in white. the material is similar to a polo shirt  which i hadn't counted on. it was also on the large size and just unflattering on me. still  the quality seemed to be good.
-1,I returned this dress because the material is so flimsy and thin. i was expecting higher quality  especially for the price. i was disappointed. it is a pretty dress and fit great  but i felt like i was wearing tissue paper.
-1,I am 5 '5 and 119 pounds with an athletic cury body type. the dress wore bulky and ran large at size 2.
0,Like the idea of this shirt so much. but the neckline was still way too low- the top of my bra was visible. wishing the under layer really covered as no way i'm going to another layer to an already layered shirt. might just be my body type  so might work for someone else  but sending back.
0,This top does sit weird  feels like a circus outfit... but at the same time its unique in its own way. i ordered a large and it was true to size in shoulders and chest area but larger and wider waist down  probably because of the way this top is styled. i'm 6ft tall 160 lbs i have curvy body and small chest 34a and i felt that top was a little too cropped for my long torso but i kind of liked it anyway. material is nice and soft for both grey wool and white cotton.
-1,This top is really cute and i love the design. however  the first time i wore it  the waste band started unraveling.
1,"These are the best leggings i have ever worn - and i wear a lot of leggings. i am 5' 8"" tall and 127lbs. i bought a s/m. they very soft and warm. they stay up perfectly  and do not pinch or make any lines. i am amazed that they are so inexpensive. i am buying 2 more after this review!"
0,The shirt is great except for the arms!! the band around the arms are tight and it makes the arm holes gape weirdly unless you are standing with your arms straight down by your side.
1,I am petite so ordered in the store and they shipped to my home. i ordered a 24p and they fit great. they stretch a tiny bit. goes with a lot of tops and they are light weight which is great with houston westher
0,Contrary to some of the reviews posted the dress is not excessively sheer. you can't see black underwear thru the fabric  but you can see the body's silhouette in front of a light source. it's not lingerie sheer  but more like a medium weight gauze (without the wrinkles). if you're older or modest the sheerness may bother  otherwise (due to the print) it shouldn't be much of a factor.    now on to the size... i'm a plus size girl (size 18) and based on reviews saying the dress was huge  i ordere
0,This seemed to run a little bit small on me... more form fitting than on the model in the photo. also  it's thin. i'd be sold on it for sure if it were just a little longer too because i like the almost-lingerie-like look. the lace applique is pretty  and if you purchase it for that  then it really shows up better on the two lighter colors - it really gets lost all in black.
0,I like everything about this shirt except i wish the embroidery was on the back too. gives it a cheaper look by only having it on the front. you will look prettier coming than going for sure!
-1,This shirt looked cute until i tried it on... worst fit ever. im thin  and this style of top is usually quite flattering  but this one missed the mark big time.
0,When i read all these positive reviews i did not hesitated  as i wanted good basics which will be good investment in me as looking good is always investment. well  i love blue color as i am blonde wih blue eyes and this color makes my eyes brighter and matches almost everything but..the design of the shirt is made oversize fit basically the shirt should not be dressed as fitted it's more relaxed fit so if you wear medium go head and order medium even if the small fits unless you want to look lik
-1,I loved this skirt when i tried it on. the material is soft with a bit of stretch. i'd say this runs a little large. for reference  i'm usually a size 2/4 in retailer and the 2 was still a little large towards the end of the day as it stretched out.     however  my disappointment was with the buttons.i wore it for a day when all of a sudden the top button popped off. fine  that button is the most used. i sewed it back on myself and even reinforced the top three buttons that i use to take on and of
0,"I was quite excited to find this tee in the store. the design looked interesting and it seemed nice on the mannequin. the bright red color really stood out in person. i am 5'2""  34b  tried on my usual size s and it was humongous! although the sales lady found a size xs (they don't have size xxs available in the store) for me to try on  it was still huge like a tent. it probably would fit better for a tall body figure. i would recommend those who are interested in this tee to try it in the store "
-1,This dress is so cute! i went to the store to try it on and although i knew the dress would fit i could not get the zipper up. my mom  the sales lady and i all tried to get the zipper up and it would not move past the ribbon. i wish i could have bought this dress but i can't without a working zipper. i tried a size up and every dress at the store that was my size and none of them worked. please fix the zipper problem so i can have this dress!
1,I'm very surprised by the review given that said this was frumpy. it it absolutely adorable  and the classic plaid is timeless. as first reviewer said  the styling of this on the model does it no favors. it is in reality form fitting but in a very flattering  forgiving way. the waist nips in nicely underneath the top section  then flares out on the bottom section. that bottom flare can sometimes add inches/pounds but this top does it in a very modern  subtle and flattering fashion. and the mater
-1,I was so excited to order this top - it looked like it was made of more sturdy  soft cotton  but sadly after receiving it today i found that to not be true. it's incredibly sheer - you'd have to wear a cami underneath  which defeated the point for me. the pleating in the front hides your bra  but you can see it from all other angles (i tried it on with an unlined nude lace bra  which can easily hide under sheer clothing). i was hoping to be able to wear it on its own without a cami and for it to
1,Purchased this top at my local store and it is very flattering! not to boxy  hits at the hip and drapes nice. great for work or with jeans. i purchase the navy faux fur scarf to wear around the neck and wow!
-1,This is a cute item at a good price point  though the lack of lining in cartonnier items drives me batty. unfortunately  the wool is so itchy i could not tolerate it more than a second.
0,So i was super excited to get this skirt  unfortunately it's not what i thought it would be. the color is much different then what pictured  it has bronze threading and the black on the picture is more gray in real life. the material isn't so great easier  i thought it would be thicker but instead it's pretty thin and wrinkles easy. the design is very cute and it is a flattering shape but the material is just too poor for me to give this a good rating. i wouldn't say it's itchy like the other re
0,"I have been lusting after this dress and though tit would be great for thanksgiving. the fit for me  however  is totally wrong. for reference  i'm 32dd  5'8""  140 lbs  and am a s or 4. the small fit well in the body area but felt a little small in my upper arms. the arm length was more of a 3/4 sleeve on me which looked terrible because the sleeves are baggy. the quality felt like it was lacking  too. the material felt like it would pill easily. order with caution."
-1,I agree with the previous reviewer that the fabric and details are beautiful  but with the shirring from the neckline and absolutely no fitting anywhere  my shape got totally lost and i looked huge. the difference in length of the dress and slip really bothered me  as well. possibly great for pregnancy  because you look like your about 8 1/2 months anyway.
-1,"I bought two  one in white and one in blue print and wore the blue print top once and loved it. then i washed it according to the instructions on the tag (in cold gentle cycle and hung to dry). it shrunk up 4"" in the length and 2"" in the width and now it doesn't fit at all. also  after one wear  the buttons are coming off (before i even put it in the wash) and it's covered in loose threads. the quality is just not there. i'm going to return both and show the sales lady the difference in size on"
-1,"The photos online make it look like a comfortable  relaxed  lightweight early fall/spring cardigan. when it arrived it looked very wrinkly and there is no ""shimmer"" as far as i can tell. i tried using my steamer to get some of the wrinkles out  but it didn't work. it looks too rumpled and i don't want to wear something that looks like i just rolled out of bed."
-1,This top was gorgeous and fit perfectly right out of the bag  with only a quick ironing. unfortunately  the first time i washed it (cold water  hang dry)  it shrunk so that it no longer fits across the bust without tape where it was once roomy  is much shorter  and feels rougher to the touch. like another reviewer said (unfortunately  after i had purchased and washed!)  i wish the label would have just said to dry clean only  because i regret washing it and would have done otherwise if i had kno
1,Taking the sweater out of the package i was kind of skeptical because of the shape  but to my surprise it looks like as it does on the model. it does take a minute to figure out how to wear it. i ordered the medium (normally wear a size 8) and is a little long  but goes with my personal style. i love the idea of being able to wear it out without looking frumpy or comfy at home.
1,I'm glad i tried this on. i was drawn to the burgundy and pink floral print  but i wasn't so sure about the cut or style of the top. once it was on  however  i loved it. i don't much care for the a-line tops that remind me of maternity wear. they're cute on rail-thin  young girls  but not so much on mom-bod women in their 40s. this top is the exception. the details from the buttons to the thin pleats  the unique cut of the bust-line and the print make this top both lovely and flattering. i wore
-1,This vest looked so cute online but it's a disaster. the quilting is so bulky that the drawstring doesn't work properly and it just hangs. itlooks like something out of a costume closet that could be used for a peasant farmhand or a zombie movie. seriously  it's bad.
1,The fabric is very light weight  more of a shirting material.  this surprised me because the dark flowers almost looked like flocked velvet in the picture.  the flowers are actually printed on cotton that has woven stripes.  it is so soft and light!  there is also a little webbing detail in the front yoke but nothing shows because there is a simple sewn in lining.  the skirt is not lined but the hem is weighted with a trim so that the skirt will hang right.  very flattering.  it does run big tho
-1,This skirt looks great on  i didn't even think before buying it  planning to wear it all summer. so the aesthetic is great. quality and design  not so much. you get exactly one good wear out of it before the folding absolutely disintegrates  it is not sewn in or built to last.     then  it looks like a cheap sarong over a cheap miniskirt. i thought the dry cleaner might be able to fix it  but they said they would have to resew the whole garment  not exactly what you want to hear with almost bran
0,"I liked this dress so much in the store - but didn't have it in my size - so had it shipped (and yes  paid shipping costs...) but it just didn't work on my body. the top is sort of poofy for lack of a better word - it made me look kind of poofy all over and really - i am not poofy!   it's a lovely color - and might look terrific on a tall woman - but at 5'3"" - not so good - had to return  sadly."
1,"These didn't work for me because i am too straight shaped for these jeans. try them if you have a smaller waist and curvy hips and bottom! i didn't have anything to fill out the hips and seat. for reference  i ordered size 25  and they were loose in hip and seat  but fit my waist. my hips are 34.5"" and waist is 28"". they are a thinner stretch denim than they appear  but not jeggings thin."
0,Well made but strange fit. the medium was long and narrow  waaay too small.
-1,"This sweater is a cute design but did not work for me. i am 5'9"" and this is way to short/cropped and looks awkward. the quality was so so  it looked stretched out in the front. it's getting returned."
1,"I love a jumpsuit for its ease of dressing. this is the 3rd i've purchased from retailer. material is thin and gauzy as described. with a sweater or jacket it will be plenty warm for so cal winters and great the rest of the year. if you are all tall  the waist might fall a bit short. i am 5'6"" and the waist just barely hits my waistline. doubt i would have purchased this item full price  but on sale it's a great deal."
0,I ordered this in the mauve and it's a really pretty lilac color. unfortunately  the fabric is very thin and you can see your bra right through it. my usual size fit great in the shoulders and bust area  but goes downhill from there. the top is cut wide under the armpits and just hangs funny in front. based on the model picture  i thought this would be a little more form fitting in the front. it's also very long. completely covers my butt in the back and then some. could of been a beautiful tank
0,Beautiful dress with the colors and pleats. i did not have the same problems with the bust area that others did. my biggest complaint is the exposed zipper doesn&#39;t lay flat  even when just hanging on the hanger. when actually on a person the zipper juts out. had to be returned!
-1,Way too much fabric; sticks out like jodhpurs but from the hip - eek! might be a great dress in rayon or a drapey fabric  but the extra fabric just piles up on itself... the outer layer also doesn't feel like it will breath. add the cotton lining  and i think it will feel miserable in the heat of the texas summer. returning.
0,I bought these for a trip to the caribbean. i sweat a lot. if you have ever been humiliated by having a ring of sweat around your crotch area  then i do not recommend these shorts in the moss color. this color and fabric do not camouflage sweat. i will spare you the photos.
1,I bought this dress to wear to a rehearsal dinner. like other reviewers have said it is a true shift dress. i'm 5'2  114lbs and the 0 fit me like a glove. it was a little hard to get the top on because the bow is not detachable (wish there was a snap or something) but once on i was in love. i may have to safety pin my bra to the bow so it doesn't show because it kept showing when i tried on. overall a very beautiful dress.
0,"This dress is pretty and is somewhat fitted in the bodice. it does have an a-line fit in the skirt. the stitching is beautiful. honestly the stitching was a little too bright for me. some may like that  but i was hoping for a little more toned down or muted. the colors are so vibrant in my opinion it almost cheapens the dress. the fabric is cotton and it is not lined. i am 5'9"" and it does hit right about where it does on the model. i am sending it back  because i didn't say ""wow  i love this"" w"
-1,This blazer looks great on the model and i have a long torso so i thought it would be perfect. when i got it it looked like a big box and didn't fit anywhere. the shoulder pads were giant and the bottom of the coat was huge. i got a small based on other reviews  but it was way too big. sadly  i had to return it.
-1,Unfortunately  this dress did not work for me like the other reviews. i am 5'8  130lbs  and the dress looked like a tent on me (size s). there was just way too much material at the bottom. also  while the dress is lined  both layers are quite thin- not see through  but i would not call them substantial either. for the cost of the dress and the material  it wasn't worth paying more to have it tailored to fit better.
0,I ordered the geranium and teal. geranium is an awkward pink  but i loved the teal. beautiful color. ordered large  hoping for some length. they're very lightweight and almost too short. if you hold this up its just a big rectangle  but it flows nicely over the body and has the appearance of being longer on the sides. unfortunately you can see all of my bra and to my stomach when my arms are even slightly raised. i decided to return both.
-1,"I am 5'8""  140lbs  pear-shaped. i ordered the s and it fit perfectly  just skimming the floor. the material is a beautiful gauzy metallic material that is lightweight with a beautiful drape and wonderful sorbet-inspired colors. the waistband is elasticized but not elastic  and there is no unflattering poofing  which can happen with skirts like this. the flaw  however  is in the decision to only half-line this skirt with an off-white jersey material. the half-lining isn't horrible but i found it"
1,Love this dress. perfect for spring and fall. great material and well made. lovey design. the dress has a built in slip.
1,I did not have the same experience as the other reviewers. found the color just as pictured - a dusty pink (made to look worn - so may not be your thing). fabric hangs nicely and is slimming on me. long enough for leggings but great with jeans  booties and long necklace (needs accessorizing). the aged look may not be for all  but overall i love it.
-1,Maybe i shouldn't have sized up to an xl but i'm not sure a smaller size would have solved the weird fit. the vee is quite low and i'm busty. it'll be really low if you're smaller on top. the fit from back to front where it ties looked horrible on me. not tight at all. it's almost balloon like around the hem and from the side view  i looked like a really wide green apple. i hate leaving a bad review because i know someone may love it but i wouldn't recommend it.
0,"Really wanted this to worked for me. ordered the s in ivory (the color i really wanted but xs was sold out) and the xs in cedar.  loved the knit and look and quality but the sweater was boxy and huge even in xs.  not flattering on my petite frame (5'2""  115#).  so disappointed as i've been looking for a non-wool sweater like this."
0,I really wanted this to work. the style and colors are great and it is comfortable too. i didn't like how big the skirt portion was or how stiff the fabric was. it looked like a plaid tent on me but not in a terrible way. it could work on the right body.
-1,This romper is cute  well-made and true to size  but i haven't figured it out how to put this on without having someone tie the back ties. which pretty much means that going to the bathroom is not an option while you have this romper on. not sure what the designers were thinking here. i'm returning this one.
1,I love these jeans! i really like the way they fit and haven't had problems with them stretching out like other reviewers have.
-1,"I was so smitten by this shirt when i saw it online. i love embroidery and purple is my favorite color. i am a size 10 and decided to order an l. the shoulders fit well  but the rest of it was huge...like another reviewer said...like a maternity top. i would also concur with the reviewer who said "" [what] takes away from the lovely purple flowers is the blotchy moss dye finish on the fabric."" this is so true. the embroidery does not stand out / is not highlighted like in the photograph; they hav"
-1,Top opens in the middle right in front. should have some sort of closure inside to prevent this top from flying open will return
0,So many things to love: love the mod kind of style  the forgiving pleats and empire waist and the fabric quality. but the neckline is just way too deep. if they didn't pin the one on the model  i'm a monkey's uncle. that super low neckline takes what should be a nice day dress and turns it into something you can't really wear in a church or in front of your dad. i seriously considered altering it  but the waist is already so high  i felt it would ruin the line of the dress.
0,I absolutely loved these pants the first several times i wore them. the fit is flattering  they are a perfect long length  and the colors are stunning. after several wears  it was time to wash them and i followed the directions provided to wash with cold water and line dry. i was initially horrified with the amount that these pants shrunk in fit and length and the colors ran together. after a lengthy ironing session  i was able to smooth out the material and restore much of the length and fit bu
0,I'm surprised to be unhappy with this... reading all the rave reviews. but  i had a different experience with it. the cut is funky... and seemed much more tapered on me than on the model in the picture. i think if you're very slim  this may work well  but for any curves or hips... not so flattering... imo. i think it's a pretty jacket... but not for me... it's going back. and ps... i paid $448 for it and see it's on sale for about 1/2 that just a week later. the discounted price may be a good de
1,This top in the remaining blue - green is not the top pictured.  it's like the photos posted in a recent review by inwonderland.  the color is deep and beautiful.  the neck is high  the lace is floral  there's a seam under the bust with a center pleat falling from it.  there's no reason for hesitancy at the sale price.
0,The image online doesn't depict this blouse well.. my complaint is that the sweater portion looks crooked and shrunken where it has been cut at waist level and the ruffles have been attached at the hips. maybe i received a flawed piece  either way  i'll be sending it in for return.
0,"This sweater was a little bit of a let down. i ordered the pink and it is actually a tan sweater with (bright) coral material woven throughout. it wasn't the 'soft pink/coral' color that it appeared to be online. while the material is very cozy  the sweater itself is short and boxy. i would've like the width better if the length would've been a little more proportionate. i am 5' 0"" and ordered a petite small. probably returning."
-1,On a positive note the dress was very well made  great quality as usual from retailer. however. this dress looked like a sack  i believe it may have been the combination of the drab color and the sack like shape. very plain and unflattering. for reference i am 5 5 140lbs 34c ...so i do have a shape it just did nothing for me. it had to go back.
-1,I opened the package and the dress is two pieces. it is the skirt part with an orange cami top that the sweater goes over. the sweater was too short for me  as i am busty and would not work. i ordered my normal size and the band around the rib cage did not go from side to side so i didn't try it on.
0,This is a cute dress  not real form fitting and made of a thin but comfortable jersey material. little see thru and kind of sexy though if you have cute lingerie.
1,These pants are so comfy and perfectly casual without being sloppy. they're the perfect summer pants.
0,"This is an absolutely beautiful skirt from the front. gives a perfect hourgass shape with the strategic color blocking. however  if you have ""shapely"" hips and back-side  this will definitely emphasize that. had to take it back. a little bit much for work and other formal/professional events. however  if you're less endowed in that area  it might work well. gives a great shape!"
-1,The fabric and cut of this blouse are beautiful  but the v was so deep i could never wear it without a cami and i think that would ruin the look. i have a large chest  but the similarly cut blouse (without the textured fabric - from the same designer) fit me fine. this one is just cut differently. i even tried sizing up and down - to no avail. the photo on the model seems misleading because i don't see how the neck would lay flat or stay that high on anyone - even with a smaller chest. i was so
1,This dress is super comfy and really cute! i was worried that the horizontal stripes might not be flattering  but they didn't make me look larger at all. it's great for casual wear  but can easily be dressed up with a jacket and booties.
1,I love the color  it has a lavender hue. it's slightly see-through  but breathes nicely and is very soft and comfortable. it falls long in the back and fits slim through the torso.
-1,I would have kept this dress if it weren't for the giant arm holes and reveal my entire bra on both sides. other than that  it looks just like it does on the model and is a nice  substantial material.
-1,I ordered this dress is in the yellow/orange. the colors are pretty  the pink detail is nice and that's about it. the slip underneath is a form fitting yellow cotton - no big deal. the dress itself runs very large and in an unflattering way. if i was pregnant  it was perfect. the material feels cheap to me and this  along with the roomy fit - is why this dress will be returned.
1,Very cute plaid button down that is tts; i am busty and the l fit just right with enough room without the buttons doing the splits like most shirts. the dainty details & material of this button down makes this stand out from other button downs that look like flannels--which this is not. it is woven of a fine material enough to be able to wear a camisole underneath  it is not a flannel shirt. colors are vibrant and the purple in the back really is quite attractive. happy i got this on sale & sale
-1,"The lace and fit were good. but the length seemed awkward to me given how boxy and flowy-ish the dress is. it felt like a baby doll with sleeves or something. and i hated the ""outside"" middle material  hated it. it felt cheap and odd when compared to the lace. maybe i was just not in the right demographic for this piece."
0,I was so excited for this coat when i saw it in the catalog  but disappointed when it got to stores. the faux fur pictured both here and in the catalog looked much more of a burnt red brown color than the straight up maroon that it actually is in store. i'd say it even looks a bit purple. the nice thing is that it is detachable and you can replace it with something else if you really don't like the color. i have decided to buy it anyways because the fit of the coat is lovely and simply stunning.
1,This is very unique and stylish! the embroidery is stunning plus it is extremely comfortable. it is pretty warm. it does not itch me at all as others have noted.
-1,I bought a pair of these a month ago and first time i washed them they came out with light spots all down the leg. i figured i did something wrong so i bought another pair in the same color and one in sage. just washed both pairs according to care instructions (no spills  stain remover  or anything but detergent) and both came out with light spots all down the leg. very sad to have wasted all that money.
-1,So bummed. i was really hoping this top would work for me. i got the black in regular size 4 and the pink in petite size 4. both hit my breast too high and were too bulky in the mid section. i have a sort of short torso  wear a small 34c  and am have a defined waist. when tops are bulky  it gives me no shape and just looks terrible. i am having the hardest time finding pretty tops that suit my figure. they did not lie flat like on the model but had so much extra fabric they stuck out. the constr
1,This shirt is so soft and luxuriously feeling. the material looks very nice and seems well made. it has a nice length to it  so it can be worn properly with leggings without any worry. i'm a 36d and can't get the button to close properly  so i'd recommend sizing up if this could be an issue for you. overall it will be a very versitile piece i'm excited to add to my wardrobe.
1,This romper checks off all the boxes! it's beautiful and the fit is perfect!
0,Super soft  super cute but too short for a dress  too long and too overwhelming for a shirt  and didn't like the look with leggings at all so sadly i'm returning. love the colors  feel and style but no way will sizing up or down fit in a way that was functional...having said that..fits tts i guess.
0,This is a very pretty shirt which is too narrow across the back. i need to be able to move my arms freely at work  so this did not work for me. you may be able to size up for a better fit if moving your arms is important to you.
0,The front and back of this square sweater are the same  and the pattern of the stitching makes it look like it's on backwards.the lace would be nice  but it's itchy. and the sweater is cropped  so i think the layered lace look is odd because the whole thing is so short on the body. the 3/4 sleeves make it look small and fitted  but the body shape is bulky. just couldn't get it to work.
1,Love this skirt! i did have to get one size larger than usual but the length was perfect on me and i love the color (i got the slate).can be dressed up or down.
0,I liked it online  but i didn't want to pay shipping for something i wasn't sure if it is good. when i saw one size 4 in the store  i was excited to try it on. however  it didn't quite meet the expectation. the dress fits a little loose (donna morgan size 2 fits me better)  and it is not lined at all. the separate top piece is just way too big without any shape. there must be a clip on the back of the top shown on the model to make it look smaller. i love the blue floral print  but that is the o
-1,I saw this dress in the store and loved everything about it. they had an extra large  i usually wear a large  and i thought it would perfect with some leggings. i tried to get the dress over my chest but no chance. my sister who wears a medium tried to put it in too and she couldn't fit it past her chest either. we flipped it inside out and couldn't find a zipper. maybe the dress in the store was mislabeled but the bust ran very small. it's too bad  it looked adorable and i was so excited to try
1,I love wearing this blouse with jeans and my cute sneakers. this blouse is frilly and flirty. it has three quarter sleeves that have one cute fabric covered buttons that match the button front closure. i am 5ft 1 inch  pear shaped  and my bust line is 36 c. i ordered an xs and small regular. i ended up with the small regular  and it fits nicely and i get loads of compliments when i wear it. it's made very well and the plaid pattern is random. i wear a cute boxy sweater over it when its chilly  a
-1,"I thought this was adorable on the model  but not so much on me. i actually didn't mind it when i tried it on with a long cardigan  but i didn't want to keep it for 1 look. the material felt inexpensive. the shape was very unflattering for an average sized women like myself. i'm 5'8"" and about 160 lbs."
-1,A serious joke. i struggled with the buttons for a good 10 minutes and gave up after the 3rd button. i'm not sure what they were thinking.
-1,I agree with the previous reviewer that this shirt is way to sheer at least for me. if you don't mind wearing a cami under it or your bra and skin showing in the back especially  then it might be for you. i did not feel like it was very good quality either the print is really cute  but then it did not button all the way up and i like the option because i think they drape better when they have buttons to the top wether you choose to button up.
-1,This sweater looks great in the picture but when it came in the mail turned out to be enormous. i tried it with a belt on like in the picture but that just made the whole sweater bunch up everywhere. the quality is nice. maybe sizing down would help. but the medium/large is going back. i am normally a medium.
1,While this top does fit very loose  it is very cute and can be relaxed or you can dress it up. it is shorter in the front and longer in the back which makes the shirt take on a flattering look. i bought the green color and it is a very rich color  it will be perfect for fall! you may consider ordering a size down if your regular size tends to fit loose.
0,I love this dress now that it is on sale; sized down to sm petite  added a simple full slip. endless compliments and inquiries on where to buy it!
0,Was excited for this shirt. i usually wear a medium to large depending on the cut and material  so i went with a medium. i was swimming in it. definitely recommend ordering a size below your normal.
0,"I ordered the dress online and found it to be not as pictured.  the length hit several inches above the knee.  the sleeves are also 3/4 length rather than full length as pictured.  i found the cut to be much less fitted through the torso as well.  i tried both the small and xsmall  which are my usual sizes.  the small was very loose through the torso  the xsmall was better  but looked overall too short  as if it were a petite cut.  i am 5'9""  however the model is supposed to be 5'10""."
1,It's a cozy sweater that doesn't make me feel frumpy  still stylish and it's not too heavy but still warm enough. it's like wearing a blanket sort of. definitely sheer with the big loom  wear a camisole under it. i got compliments the first day i wore it!
1,This is a great casual shirt that works great for a day at the beach and is also comfortable enough to wear to sleep. wore this shirt to school one day with an undershirt underneath and wore it again hiking several days later with just a sports bra underneath.
1,"I bought this dress in gray in a size 4. i am usually a size 6  even an 8 in maeve  so i said this dress runs a tad large. it is soft and easy to wear--throw it on and go. i think it looks best with a belt but that's my opinion. i am 5' 8.5"" tall  and this is a midi length on me. plenty long. not sure how it will wash. i think a fabric steamer will be needed. all in all  very pleased."
1,I ordered a bunch of clothing from retailer last week  and this is by far my favorite purchase! the detail is gorgeous  it's very soft  and figure flattering.
1,Great addition to my cold weather wardrobe! comfortable and has the slouchy look  but still nice enough to wear to work.
0,I tried this dress on in the store  prepared to buy this lovely piece. i feel that it should have been a few inches longer  it would look more proportionate. next  the tie is really difficult to place  but it creates some great detail to the front and back. it wrinkles easily  i can see it would need to be ironed before each wear. lastly it is not lined  what a bummer  at least the skirt could be lined. but  it does have pockets  that is sweet.
1,So cozy and warm  great for the cold nights!
1,I ordered these in the blue size 28p. i am 5' 120 lbs. a size 6p and curvy. the jeans fit very nicely in thigh and hip area (and i don't have skinny thighs). the jean is not a low rise which is what i was looking for. i was looking for a jean that was a little dressier yo wear out to grab a drink or catch a movie. these jeans fit the bill because they give off a polished vibe  especially when paired with a dressier top  blazer  skinny belt and heels. also  i like that the jeans don't have the to
1,This is a gorgeous flowy top. i paired it with a pair of army green pants and have received a ton of compliments. you can dress this top up for a night out or for work  or style it for a fun evening out. you will be very pleased with this top.
0,I have mixed feelings about this dress. the color is fantastic. not too bright  not too dark. the material is super soft and comfortable and the length was perfect. i did end up returning this item though as no matter which bra i chose  the straps showed. it just was not hitting my right on the shoulders. i do not like having my bra straps show or constantly be trying to tuck them away (especially at a wedding or work?). this is what ultimately led me to return the dress ? even though it is beau
-1,I had really high hopes for this shirt after reading the reviews. first off it runs really small. i usually wear a small or medium ( 4 or 6) i couldn't even get the 6 on. i probably could have even done a 10. the fabric was extremely flimsy. i was almost afraid i was going to rip it taking it off. other than the sizing and the fabric  it just wasn't flattering on me.
-1,I should have listened to previous reviewers. but the dress looks so good on the model in the two dimensional pictures. when it arrived in the mail  i realized this is a mistake. it has no shape  material is poofy and feels cheap. it is going back.
-1,Like most people here  i wanted this beautiful dress to fit. so  i decided to see for myself if maybe  just maybe the negative reviews were wrong. they weren't. if you have any sort of breasts at all  the top probably won't fit properly. i imagine a narrow upper torso  like a 32 or 33  possibly a 34 might find the top part of the dress closes properly  but with a 36 c  i could not get a size 12 to button up. the waist hit at a strange spot  and despite the picture showing a narrow waist and grad
0,I thought this top was absolutely beautiful! i couldn't wait to get it in but unfortunately it was very big on me. (i'm 5 ft  105 lbs and got the pxs) the arm holes were so big as well as the overall fit. i'm very disappointed  i really wanted this top to work.
1,Flattering! i love how it looks like a maxi dress.  fits me perfectly!
1,"Beautiful spring dress. perfect for luncheons or any occasion. so very pretty  lovely fabric and good fit. you will definitely feel pretty in this dress. y daughter is 5'3"" and the length was perfect."
1,"I ordered this in xs  i'm 5'4""  around 115lbs  and it fits perfectly. the material is very soft  but not see-through  and the romper is well-made. i wish it came in other colours  i'd buy more!"
0,Very cute coat but could not keep it for the price...just not sure it is worth almost $200 00 (with tax added to cost). when it goes on sale  i will most likely buy it.
1,Cozy. soft. comfortable. a perfect transitional top that bubbles over with personality..it's a unique fabric design that makes you feel like you're on vacation ..love it.
1,This is a fun sparkly top that was great over the holidays with a sparkly long-sleeved top underneath  and will be fun in the summer too. i got a size small since my regular size extra-small was sold out  and it was still really cute. great cut and design. as others have mentioned  the quality could be slightly better  but it's a good deal if you get it on sale.
0,Do not under estimate the boxy shape of this it looks kind of like a hospital scrub. i think with this top the styling is key. the sleeves are long and boxy and the neckline is somewhat of an oval so for me this wasn't a top i could just throw on without doing some outfit editing.i styled this with a dark high waisted skinny jean which i tucked the shirt into and some red heels and i was ready to go. anyways the material was great it was a silk type polyester that didn't seem to be static prone
1,Bought these over the weekend and i am in love! they are very soft  extremely flattering  and the rich green color is fantastic. i may go back for the black. i went with my usual size 28 for reference  and the fit is great. these will be a fall staple  for sure!
-1,I ordered these a size up because i'd just had a baby and knew i needed a bigger size. my pre-pre baby size (chubby phase) were size 8/29. these fit like a size 4. way too small. very disappointed!
-1,I was so excited to splurge on a mara hoffman suit and was sorely disappointed when i received this suit in the mail. i'm petite and fairly curvy  so i knew it would likely be a little long in the torso but the whole suit was so oddly shaped  i couldn't imagine anyone it would fit. the square shape in between the halter pieces is awkward  and the pieces that are supposed to hold your chest are super wide and loose.
1,"I am 5' 4"" and 128 lbs and could have worn the 4 or 6 but took the 6. it does run short and the length in the 6 was better than the 4 with arm hole size being the same. the bees are embroidered making the fabric high quality and normally i would run from a print like this but not this one. it has great style!"
0,I ordered this sweater in black and thought it was a pretty design and something different in a cardigan. when i tried it on  it was an odd fit and very boxy and unflattering. i wanted to like it and keep it  but i knew i would not wear it so  unfortunately  it went back.
-1,I loved this shirt when i purchased it but it shrank badly and the front seam (on mine) was crooked. no longer have my receipt so not sure i can return it~ sigh. i do love the pilcro chinos i bought to go with it however!
-1,Gorgeous color and great price  but too low cut and because of the design  a cami's wouldn't work. disappointed
0,"Adorable top  but i have to agree with what two other reviewers said... that is is boxy and unflattering. i have a similar patterned top  also by maeve  but the sizing on that runs small  medium  large. the s petite that i have doesn't fit quite the same as the 4 petite in this blouse. this is definitely more ""square"" in the torso  and the ruffles do stick out more - very flouncy. it just made me look frumpy instead of the sexy date night look i was going for. i am 5' and 120 lbs. also  i didn't"
-1,"The model looks awesome in this cute top  but on me it looked boxy but was too tight around the chest and was too short (for reference  i'm 5'7 "" 140 lbs.  and 34c). the front is non-stretchy eyelet lace cotton fabric  yet the back is stretchy. in theory  it's pretty  but in reality it doesn't work - at least for me. i think it might work for someone petite with a smaller chest."
1,This shirt is beautiful and well-made. the lace is soft - not scratchy at all. looks great with a cream or gray cami underneath.
1,These jeans were not for me. they are very straight...hence the name 'parallel'. i'm have more of a straight athletic build so for me it was too much straight and didn't flatter my shape at all.    however  very nice jean once again from pilcro.
1,I loveeeeeeee this dress! i saw it online and immediately loved the blue/ orange large floral print but so did everyone else and it sold out quick. but i thought the shape could be flattering so i ordered in the black polka dot and loved the shape! so flattering. i ended up going in store and buying the other two colors. the patterns are vibrant and lovely shape. my only concern was seeing it in store i noticed it stretching while just hanging on the hanger. i wish the fabric was of better quali
0,First off  the other reviews are spot on regarding the quality of this top. the material is thick and pleasant feeling  the print is beautiful and the construction is nicely done. however  i just couldn't get past the fit issue  which was also mentioned by the other reviewers. i ordered a 14 for my 38 dd chest  and it was loose in all the wrong places. i'd be interested to see what a 12 looks like on me  but i'm afraid it would be too snug. this may look awesome on someone else  but i had to ret
0,The vest looks  so stylish on. it makes a regular t shirt look edgy with it on. i love the vest but the price is too high
0,This sweater is extremely roomy. the cut is very wide - wider than it is long  the sleeves are dolman style  and the neck is a little loose. with a lot of manipulation i managed to convince myself that i wasn't wearing a tent  but i would suggest sizing down and also being tall and thin  if you can. i'm keeping mine despite a funky fit on my hourglass frame because i'm exploring funky town lately. join me at your own risk!
1,Beautiful white denim pants. the fit is perfect. fitted on the top with a nice flare on the bottom. very classy and versatile cut. paige denim runs long for me and these are no exception. will be getting them hemmed but i don't mind because they are perfect!
-1,Love the shape and flow of this dress. but i was sent a dirty stained dress so this is going back.  would not recommend
-1,At first i was taken by the beautiful lacework and the pictures online showing what appeared to be a loose but shaped silhouette. the pictures must have been staged with pins in the back because  in person  the shirt fits like a circus tent. without exaggeration  there is a surplus of about 16 inches.    the material is still beautiful. and because of that  i haven't decided whether i'll return this shirt or try cutting out some excess fabric to create a cleaner  more fitted shape.
1,"I like this sweater so much i just bought it in a second color! the pleats make the sweater conform to my shape just enough to be flattering. i wore it over three different dresses this week that might have felt too bare for work or cooler weather. i live in a hot climate so this is the right weight for our cooler months. the metallic threads give it a little bit of flair and the grey color goes with everything. i'm 5'7"" size 10-12 and the large fit just right."
1,"I received many compliments on this dress. for a maeve dress it did run large. i normally take a 4 or 6 in maeve but with this dress i bought the size 2 and it fits perfect. i am 5' 2"" and 120 lbs. i have a little belly and this dress hides it well. beautiful colors and nice shape. it also hits at my knee so it is perfect for work."
0,These lightweight  wide leg pilcro summer jeans are really cute  but did not look good on me. i love the fabric-a slightly 'nubby' no stretch chambray that is perfect for hot weather. the waist was a bit large and there was fabric to spare in the hip area. the legs are very wide  adding to the comfort factor of these! the details are really cute-contrasting fabric at the slash front and rear pockets. i got a size ten in these and they were big-i can imagine they will stretch out with wear so it
0,I love the fabric and pattern of this dress so much that i decided to keep it (got it on mega sale)  but i would have never paid full price or anything close. the armholes are enormous  showing bra and all. i am not particularly large chested (34c)  and the buttons are stretched to gaping on me  even with the huge armholes. i have a cute red sweater coat that i will wear over it all fall  but i could not recommend it because of the poor cut design.  pros: great pattern  fabric  pockets  true to
1,"This top is just darling!  the body of the top is lightweight ""sweatshirt"" type material that's dyed to appear well used.  the ruffling along the bottom is color coordinated and beautifully textured.  great to wear with leggings!  the back hangs lower than the front so your rear will be covered.  extremely comfortable  machine washable.  an unexpectedly ""nicer than it looks online"" garment.  i bought the blue version which looks more lavender irl."
-1,I loved these pants. the fit well and were flattering. unfortunately after three wears  they came apart at the seam. very disappointing and frustrating.
-1,Bummed out.. this is super cheaply made and very expensive... the design is different   the color is beautiful  but the material is a different story.. it should be priced at the most 30 bucks.. not 128.. i'm returning them. also  they run very big..!
-1,I loved fabric  print and back detail. design  however  was a little too boxy to be flattering on me. even at great price i sent it back.
1,I originally bought these jeans in my true size. after wearing them a few times i realized they stretched out quickly making it hard to wear them again. retailer recommended i go down a size and now they are my favorite jean!  they are a little tight for the first 5 mins  and then they are perfect fit wear after wear. and so soft!
1,This is probably one of the best retailer purchases i have ever made! this is the most comfy and warm cardigan and is a good thickness for fall and winter. i am 5'9  a size 6/8 and the medium was perfect! buy this now!!
0,I was very excited when this dress arrived in the mail. the fabric is so comfortable  but the print was overwhelming. it is also very tight on the top and i got lost in the fabric at the bottom. i had to return it.
-1,I love the idea of this top  but there is just way too much fabric involved in person! i'm 5'2 and usually wear a small or medium to accommodate a fuller chest. i ordered a small and it fit fine around the chest but the huge swing hem combined with the slightly stiff fabric is just enormously unflattering. i feel like they could have made about 3 shirts out of it. i think the picture must have it pinned a ton in the back  the silhouette is nothing like shown. if there were just less fabric  i wo
-1,I usually buy a pair of these kind of pants every year from this brand. they are lightweight  sturdy and very flattering to my curvier body. this brand can run big  so i usually buy a size 2 rather than my normal size 4. i was going to wait it out and let someone else try them first  but then i caved and ordered them in two sizes: 26 and 27 because they didn't label them 2  4  6 etc. anymore. these pants still look well made and have cute little details  but they are bigger than ever!! the 27's
0,I love the way this top looks in the picture and the embroidery is as lovely as it appears--very detailed. it is both subtle (not cheap looking) and special.    as an earlier reviewer noted  the top is not see-through  a plus.    the drawbacks  though  mean that i will be returning this top.     1. the fabric is very heavy and does not drape well. i am a small woman with a large chest and ordered a size 0. the top is still loose  even in that size  and the relative stiffness of the fabric gives
0,"I am 5'2"" and i typically wear a 2 or a 2p. lately i've been finding that petite is just a little too short to wear with wedges so i often order a 2 as i did in this dress. it fits well and it's flattering. my two complaints are that it gets wrinkly fast and looks sloppy. yes  linen is a wrinkly look and that's normal for linen but somehow this dress just looks sloppy to me. more importantly  while wearing for the first time  i realized that the seams on the side were very lightly sewn and there"
-1,My favorite colors are purple and green  so when i was in the store and saw the beautiful purple flowers on the top of this blouse and all up and down the sleeves  i was was blown away. i was disappointed by the bottom of it  just huge  flowy  green fabric with no design on it whatsoever. i went with my first impression and bought it  but now that i'm trying it on in the house  i'm still bothered by the throw-away bottom of this blouse. i'm thinking this is just another retailer maternity t
1,I have several of goodhyouman shirts and i get so many compliments on them. especially the one that says forehead kisses are underrated. don't hesitate. buy this shirt. you won't be sorry.....
0,"I love the design and color of this cardigan  and the way it was styled in the store display made me snatch one up right away. but unfortunately  it's huge and shapeless (i tried size xs/s) and i'm a waif (5'2""  105#) - i think it could drape nicely on a tall woman but if you are small to average in height it'll hang down somewhere mid-thigh or even lower. you can snug up the ties  as they are threaded through the cardigan like a drawstring  but that just made it look bunchy and even more shapel"
1,I've been looking for a dress to wear to wedding this summer  and this is it. the blue color is lovely and the lace overlay is feminine and pretty. i'm small busted (34aa) with an athletic lower body (think  120-lb marathoner)  and the flare of this dress is perfect. i ordered this in a 0 and a 0 petite. the petite size looked little-girl short; the regular size hit just at my knee and was much more sophisticated. the waistband also fell at a more flattering place in the regular dress. i'm on th
-1,Just not as long as in the picture. it hit me at my hips not good!
0,Like others  i was drawn to the collar  fabric and overall look to it....  ________  pros:  - thicker fabric so it hides lumps and bumps well.  - collar is so classy  but i am drawn to anything with a collar.  - pockets are a nice touch.  _______  cons:  - thicker fabric and polyester = got hot rather quickly in it.  - runs a tad small if you have hips. there was only a medium at the store to try on and it fit everywhere but the hips; it just didn't flare out much for me being hourglass. a large
0,The jumpsuit is very pretty but it's definitely not meant for women who are on the curvier side or shorter. plus it sort of looks like pajamas on. i am 5'7 and i wanted to to look similar to the model in the picture but it comes down to my ankles so it would look best on taller/thin woman.
-1,This would be a great blouse for flat chested person. i am a size 12 and busty. i ordered an xl and it was ridiculously tight across the chest and the fabric is see through. you would need to wear a cami under it.
0,What a huge disappointment! i was really looking forward to wearing this top but it is very tight and awkward around the bust. if you have any semblance of a chest  this is not for you! i am a 38c and this was a no go. the quality of the top seems to be top notch but the fit was just no. it felt restrictive and it was hard to even move my arms and i have slender arms.
-1,"I totally agree with the last reviewer. i'm 5'2"" 115 pounds with somewhat wide shoulders. the x-small fit my torso but was so tight in my shoulders i couldn't move my arms. the small was better but was too big in the torso. the material itself was really nice. too bad the fit was so awkward and unflattering."
0,I loved the lavender color on the cape. it was soft and comfortable. but the design on the front ruined it for me. it took me all of 1 minute to know it was going back. it looked like florescent bird feathers nothing wrong with that  it just wasn't my style at all. i was a bit disappointed as it would have been perfect for cool ca nights. it looked more subdued in the photo  it's not. i clicked i would recommend to others as it is nicely made and i guess just not my taste as far as the colors an
-1,So unflattering! really disappointed. made me look 6 month pregnant and i'm a petite size 2.
1,"The fitted top and flared skirt are really nice on this piece. i am 5'6"" 125lb and i took a 6. a 4 might have been ok  but i felt more comfortable in the 6  and it had a really nice fit.    the quality is good  but there were some areas that were starting to pull and the floral details come a little frayed around the cutout edges  so i'm not sure how it will wear."
0,I wanted to love this top. the color is wonderful in the pink and the material is silky soft. it is huge though  i am a 34 dd and bought my usual small! i am going to exchange for an xs and am hoping it fits.
1,"Got charlie trousers last year in a different print in my usual size 4 (5'2""  115#). they initially fit perfectly but stretched out in the thighs and waist and now are loose.  this time i bought a size smaller (size 2). they were snug but i felt them stretch during the first wear and they fit fine now.  i recommend sizing down because they stretch out. love the print for summer (i love anything beachy) and had to have it!  nice comfortable material which isn't hot for summer.  got the regular si"
-1,I really wanted to love this dress  but it just didn't fit in anyway. i ordered an xs petite  and it was very large. the lacing in the back is completely useless  and that's what i liked about the dress. i was thinking it would be unlaced more at the top (because of chest) and then lace more tightly near the waist. it was completely closed off and the dress was still very loose and unflattering. beautiful fabric  great color combo  bad fit.
0,Wanted to love these pants  they are way  way  too long (i'm 5'4 128lbs for reference). i didn't love the way they looked cuff and didn't think it was worth having them hemmed. loved the color. would work well for someone tall and slim.
1,Another reviewer mentioned this was maternity-ish. i am currently almost 5 months pregnant  and i have to say: this is a wonderful maternity dress  even if that's not what it was made for. when not pregnant  i think this might have been a little overwhelming (and i guess we'll see next year if that's the case for me) -- there is a lot of fabric here. i am usually a small or medium in antrho dresses  and i am wearing a small in this now with room to grow as my stomach grows. the colors on the blu
0,Nicely made  pretty details  but it's cropped fairly short and is rather boxy. wore with orange linen pants and it was cute!
-1,I had my eye on this one for awhile and decided to buy it when it popped back on my wishlist. i can see why someone returned it. the sweater top hits at the worst possible spot and made me look ridiculous  like a mushroom top. from the side i saw the potential  but not enough to save it. probably one of the worst things i have ever purchased from retailer.
-1,I was so excited to get this dress  and it was such a disappointment! it looks so cute on the model  but it was very different when i got it. the color is a lot more yellow than i thought it would be  and the pattern just looked a bit strange--it stood out more against the yellow instead of looking neutral. the dress fit really awkwardly on the top. the straps were way too long  and the chest area was practically baggy when i put it on. i normally wear a 4p  and i ordered down to a 2p. the waist
0,I liked the idea of the diagonal color block but the fit of this tee was odd on me.  too tight around arms and way big and boxy around the mid-section.  going back.
-1,I bought this shirt after reading so many positive reviews. it looks much thinner and cheaper than the photo depicts.  like many reviewers have said  it does hit just above midriff but the fringe covers your belly.  it didn&#39;t hang right on me and i felt like i was wearing a rug.
1,A really beautiful  well made dress. runs extremely big though! i'm not petite by any means and ordered a large but i'm positively swimming in it. an oversized look works for this particular dress  but i think it's supposed to be more fitted so i would recommend sizing down from what you might normally expect for a piece of this style.
1,"I love a good gaucho/ culotte. these are very comfortable and fit is tts (i'm 5'9"" 145 and wear a 29). they are ironed with a line down the front  which i don't like  as it's always hard for me to keep the ironing straight. the pants have a little bit of stretch to them which is nice. since they're linen  they will require frequent ironing (which  i hate to do in the summer)."
-1,As much as i wanted to love this top  it was too flowy and and i felt like i looked bigger than i am (i'm a size 6). maybe a smaller size would have made a big difference.
1,"I'm glad they put up some pix of non-models looking cute in this dress  as it's taken a beating in the reviews! i measure 34(a)-27-35 and have no problems with the size s fit at all. it's drapey but not voluminous  with no pulling at the hips. the ""folded"" detail up at the top does call attention to the shoulders  but not in a bad way. the pleated neckline is cute on a small chest  and the red pattern/palette is awesome. love the length too -- i am 5'4"" & the size s hits me just above the knee."
-1,I finally found this dress in store today and wow! i cannot believe this cheap looking dress is from ms! they have been among the top at retailer and this unlined  baggy  cheap velvet sub is a shock! what happened? only the color is nice. please get back to yourself ms!
0,This is a cute top but the fit is problematic. it runs small on top especially around the bust and sleeves but then it flares below the waist in a billowy and unflattering way with way too much fabric.  i got both an xsp and an xxsp. the xxsp fit better on bottom but i could hardly pull my arms through the sleeves. both are going back unfortunately. for reference i'm 5' 103 lbs 32b.
-1,I purchased this in the yellow for my daughter and she has not seen it yet. the style is very cute  but the fabric is quite thin. she will have to make that call  but if i had bought it for myself  it would be going back. i'm not willing to wear a camisole under a t-shirt. it also feels like the kind of knit fabric that shrinks and skews when it's washed  so that remains to be seen.
0,I own the essential slims and love them  so i figured i could order these in my normal size and they'd fit great. i was way off. they were uncomfortably tight in the calves (which is understandable - i'm a runner so my calves are disproportionately large) and uncomfortable in the waist. i decided to order one size bigger and pretty much had the same problem in the calves. the high waist was also still unflattering and uncomfortable. these might be great for hour glass shape with skinny calves. t
1,I love this sweater! i was nervous after reading the reviews  but ordered it anyway and i'm so glad i did. i got it in grey- the tie back/v-back feature is my favorite part-- flirty and feminine  unique but also subtle. i don't think the material is scratchy. it may not be as soft as some of my other retailer shirts  but i wouldn't call it scratchy. it was perfectly comfortable to me. i will say that it's a little short though. i vary between a m and l  depending on the shirt (5'9  long torso  36c
1,I bought this for my sister. it is perfect for your favorite cat lover  the print is adorable up close but not overwhelming to secretly hide your crazy cat lady intentions. i love this myself  the material is soft and it's a perfect flowy blouse for day to night.
1,The materical is wonderful and light and the color is gorgeous  but the large was absolute gigantic. i'm returning it and sizing down possible to a small  which is unreal  since i wear a size ten normally! i am petite  height-wise  but more than length  there was just so much room width-wise. it swallowed me! the dress itself is lovely  though  so i'm definitely exchanging for a more reasonable size. but definitely size down!
0,"1. i'm 5'5"" tall  140 lbs and 38 (36d) - 32- 40. i'm normally a size 10 in most brands  and in maeve in the past. this dress was too tight across my waist and hips in a size 12  so it runs very slim.  2. this dress is very long waisted  so the top bunched up funny.  3. the horizontal bar in the back is in the wrong place  and will not hide your bra strap.  4. there are bra strap keep loops in the shoulders  but this is an off the shoulder top.  5. the underarms bunched funny.  6. the dress has h"
1,Beautiful top! the body flows nicely and the colors are wonderfully vivid. it goes with everything and looks great for work or going out. my only gripe is the sleeves are really tight. i struggle a little to get on and off but once on it looks awesome.
0,"I really thought i would love this dress the style is really nice and the material is great. however  the length made me feel like i looked short and kind of stumpy. i feel like this dress would look really good on somebody that is more like 6ft  not my 5'6"" self."
0,"I loved the actual design on the fabric. the flowers are gorgeous and i was really looking forward to wearing them  but the fabric was much too thin for me. i was surprised because another review said they were thick. to me  it felt like tights material  almost. however  they were not see through  which is great. overall  they just didn't look great on my body. 5'9"" size 6/8 curves  medium was a bit too loose."
1,Great dress. fits perfectly. will be perfect in the winter and with leggings.
-1,"I was a huge fan of these lovely swing dresses from last year and bought all 3 colors. when i saw this new one  i was thrilled and ordered it immediately. what a disappointment! why did isabella sinclair mess with a good thing? the fabric is a very loose weave sort of ""homespun"" look  which wouldn't be a deal breaker  but i could see it would be very vulnerable to snags. last year's styles had a removable light knit full slip that allowed the airy fabrics to move. this version is fully lined. yo"
-1,I agree with the other review. the fabric and pattern are adorable and well made. the fabric is not sheer at all and great quality;however  the shirt is very wide. i am a 34/26/36 and the small is way too big. the arm holes are perfect but the bottom is uncomfortably large and awkward in appearance.
1,This dress is simply gorgeous. the slit is just right  the colors are great  and most of all the fabric is very comfy! i highly recommend!
0,The snake and the studs  they make the dress. sadly  the snake is hard to find  as mentioned in another review. this dress also runs large  i'm usually a 12 and went down to 10. the images are misleading too. two pics show a small  fitted look  and the other two show a full  swing look. i'm trying to make this work but it may have to go.
-1,"The black and white photo of this sweater makes it look absolutely beautiful. the color photography looked to be a beautiful rich burnt red color. it simply did not match. it was more of an almost faded version of the rich color. the fit was ""ok"". just didn't love it."
-1,Didn't like the dress. look pregnant in it. this dress is going back.
0,This skirt was cute on  but not particularly flattering. i thought the denim was a little too stiff. typically  a-lines are flattering on my figure  but this was a miss.
-1,I was very surprised to see such dark blue sequence on this dress. it did not appear as it did on the photo. i was pretty disappointed by the color. the photo of the dress is much more impressive.
1,This is beautiful tunic for the spring and summer. great paired with jeans or white denim. runs large and is a true tunic length. very pretty fabric and built in camisole  too. only downside is that it probably needs to be hand washed/line dried to keep it looking like new.
1,"Saw this one online and when it came it did not disappoint. i ordered a xxs in black  and it was perfect. i am 5'3"" and 110 lbs. it definitely has a lot of volume to it  but i still found it flattering because the shirt is very sheer  so you can ""see"" through it to your thinner figure underneath. it comes with a comfortable but fitted camisole to wear under it  which makes it flattering. another reviewer mentioned the beading turning. i have not seen that on mine  but now i will be looking for i"
1,This tank i am in love with. the color is great to go with jeans or any color i have in my wardrobe. it works with skinny jeans  culottes or a skirt and perfectly compliments the current shoe styles. my gladiators  summer booties  and my espadrilles are all equally cute with this outfit topper. it is made out of the most beautiful lightweight material and will be great for the 100 degree plus summers that we have here in texas. the bra thing is a bit of a problem because a strapless bra dose not
0,I ordered this top because i liked the look in the back  however  the top i received looks nothing like the back. online it shows that the back has elastic & is gathered. also online it shows thin straps (that look like a bra strap) but my top has no thin straps & no elastic~ extremely odd!! i called customer service but the lady i spoke to didn't have any information or complaints about the top. i'm holding on to the top because it is cute from the front  but i was really wanting the back to lo
0,When these shorts arrived i loved them and was so excited to wear them on my upcoming trip to the beach. the high rise waist is very flattering and the material was extremely soft. the floral detailing was a little more orange than in the picture but i still loved the contrast. the first time i wore these i immediately noticed threads coming loose throughout the day. it was minor but still concerning for an item that was so costly. the real problem arose in the evening when i put on a jacket on
0,I really liked the fabric and the design of this sweater  but the sleeves hung at an odd length (no way to push them up like on the model) and the sweater was large on me. i have broad shoulders but am otherwise petite. unfortunately i had to return this. glad others are having better luck.
1,The top runs small  it is a very sexy and slimming top. i tried in l  it was too small so i have ordered it in xl. i hope it fits because it is very fitted and i am worried that the bottom will roll to the top with a fabric like this. but it is a very sexy  good looking  and slimming top. i love it!!
-1,The back of the shirt has a tag stitched in with red thread that goes through to the outside of the shirt. it is very visible and looks terrible - especially since the back is the focal point of the shirt. do not recommend
-1,Beautiful top  loved the color but shoulders were totally messed up and not sure if it was from  hanging at store or the way it was sewn.
1,The embroidery on this was beautiful but didn't hang well on my athletic/small chested upper body.
1,These pants are great. the pattern is beautiful and the fit is perfect. they pair well with a s front tucked shirt or fitted colwyn neck sweater. another great find from retailer!
0,Lovely color and sweet top  but the fabric was so itchy i couldn't wear it.
1,I was not sure if they would be flattering with the waistband  but i love them. they feel wonderful  yet they are so light. perfect for warm weather. the print takes them from day to night.
1,I got this for my daughter (teen) who had been wanting this plaid look but didn't want to look like a lumberjack! this is feminine and can be dressed up or down. it has the high low look that she loves and it is comfortable and machine washable! she will get a lot of use out of this purchase! new item but black friday discount! yay! purchased in red color.
0,Lots of pairs of the pilcro serif-- and for some reason  after 5mo or less of normal wear  these have bit the dust.   i don't dry my denim and do wash on gentle cycles... this pair just doesn't seem to be too happy. began pilling after two washes  just seems to be a different blend of fabric than the others?     super bummed and now there's no way to replace it. wamp wamp.
-1,"This dress has a beautiful fabric  i really hated to send it back. it was just so unflattering  absolutely no shape to it. i bought a 0p  i'm 5'5"" and 117lbs and it looked like a maternity dress on me."
-1,This looks so cute...but don't be fooled. it is so poofy. it does not look in real life like it does on the model. it poofs way out on the sides and looks ridiculous. i was so disappointed.
1,Super cute jacket .perfect for fall i can't stop wearing it
1,Loved it. i have receive so many compliments when i wear this. it fit great.
0,So small! i was a solid size 12 in skirts but recently lost some weight. i was still nervous to buy a size 10 so i bought the 12 thinking i can always take it in if i have to. the 12 - which should have been big on me was tiny. this skirt is built for someone with non-existent hips. returning.
-1,It is definitely pinned back on the model in the photograph. it made my 5 foot frame look short and wide.
-1,Oh boy...i didn't get this one  and it runs small. too bad.
0,The top as with most of ap's tops is well stitched. material is very uncomfortable. if you have large bust it is a little divulging. this may prompt you to wear something underneath to look modest and change the shape of the top!
0,"I recommen only becuase i like it on other people  but not on me. the pull on style didn't work  i need xs petite to fit lenght and waist  but the waist wasn't elastic enough to ""pull up"" (i have let's say a booty#. i kept hearing hte stiching give... it also looked a little too poooofffy on my frmae  i am 5'1.5"" and it stuck more out than on the model. nice idea  btu not for me. #i am 115 lbs#"
-1,I loved the cut and the stretch in the material made them comfortable  however i found that the material was unflattering for thicker thighs because it tended to cling to the body. it would have been better with some sort of lining as it would have prevented the flimsy material from highlighting imperfections. bottom of pants are not hemmed  so if you want a clean look  you may not like the edges. these were returned immediately as it just did not work for me.
1,Pretty delicate lace top...love it! hits right at waist so not unflattering at hips.
-1,This top really is lovely. i had high hopes of it looking smashing with black jeans. i wash everything before i wear it. though this garment says it needs to be dry cleaned  there was nothing so delicate about the fabric that it had to be dry cleaned. so i hand washed it with delicate soap. when the lighter colors came into contact with the black  the black immediately stained the light color. i tried putting some stain remover on the black stains  rinsed and hung it above my bath tub. it is cur
1,I'm glad i listened to the other reviewers...i ordered a large instead of my usual medium. it's roomy enough for a sweater underneath. i love the denim! it's very soft and has some stretch. my other denim jackets are stiff even after years of washing. i also love the darker denim.
-1,I have a pair of mih jeans that are the only jeans i own that i absolutely love. everything about them. this jumper looked versatile  useful and fun  so i splurged during the 25% off dress sale.  my experience with mih is that the sizing runs true  or european  and thus small. i ordered this in a medium and it is gargantuan as well as virtually shapeless. it looked horrible from every angle: front  back and sides. i cannot imagine it having more fit even in a smaller size.  the fabric is nice  p
0,I love belted sweaters  but this was way too low in front. it hung almost to my knees in front. i'm not a fan of that look.
0,Loved the look of this top. sadly it runs quite small and was very tight where other non-swing tops in a large do not. the item ran out of stock far too quickly. i normally wear a large but feared that the large would be small and wanted to order up but it was already put of stock. the quality and style are great especially for a larger chest. length is great for taller women.
-1,I bought the yellow pair on vacation last week and loved them! i wore them home on the plane and had a pony tail holder in my pocket (basic goody binder)  and there is a circle stain where the binder was! so strange! i sprayed them with spray and wash and washed them. the stain is still there and now it is discolored in the area i treated them! they are ruined! i am so disappointed and i only got one wear out of them!
0,I bought this in navy and love the multi textures and look. i'm happy it was on sale because it is so cute but i would not have paid full price on it. it runs small. i plan on wearing it for casual errand days.
-1,Does not look like the picture. lined with a cheap denim fabric inside that shows when arms are rolled up. i normally always fit in mediums and this jacket is so small in the arms as well as body that it fit like a xs.
-1,I was so excited to try this sweater on when it arrived but to my disappointment  it was overly large! i was pratically swimming in it. really love the design and the way it looks on the model. just didn't work out that way on me.
-1,I was so excited to get this top in the mail. i loved the colors  print  cut  everything. i put it on and was so disappointed  the top looks so much better on the model. i don't know if i should have gone down a size (i go between an xs and s)  but it looked terrible on me! my husband took one look at me in it and said that's being returned. still disappointed
1,I honestly bought this shirt on a whim the other day in my local retailer. i was drawn to the color and the swing. first of all  this shirt is incredibly soft and lightweight. i love the flow of the loose peplum. the straps are nicely placed  because they're wider and accentuate my arms (and cover my bra straps). i love the little v neck detail. it shows a little cleavage when bent or hunched over  but the top stays conservative when truly upright. i wore this shirt 3 days in a row last week  and
0,"As previously mentioned  this dress runs very large. i ordered accordingly  and the small was the right size for my frame  but it was just not flattering. i'm pear shaped  and i found the shoulders to be large  the neck a bit too high  and the overall cut to hug my figure in a very unflattering way. i'm 5'4""  140-ish  and maybe if i were a few pounds lighter and a few inches taller  it could've worked. i so wanted to love this  because it's soft and comfortable and cute  but back it goes."
1,I ordered this skirt online in a size 8 but returned for a 10 so it could sit a bit lower.    the fabric is so beautiful and a bit heavier so it can be worn all year long.  so glad i made this purchase.
0,This is an adorable piece but the fit is a gamble. the crotch hung way too low for comfort on these so since i got a great sale price  i had them altered. i haven't worn them yet but i'm sure i'll get compliments when i do. so if you want to take chance on the fit and/or alter them  go for it!
0,This top is beautiful! but the fabric is really stiff and itchy. in addition  it's rather cropped or short. the real disaster and heart break for me was when i washed it. the tag recommends dry cleaning  but allows for hand washing. i should have dry cleaned - it shrunk even more when i washed it on delicate setting in cold. too bad  because this looks so cute the first time you wear it. if you're up for a dry cleaning bill and don't mind a little stiff scratchy material  you'll be fine buying t
0,"I love the designs of tiny blouses. but i wish they could make them more durable. i have owned several blouses in the past where i have to use a little pin to secure the button line from pulling at the breast area  or that after a few delicate washings have come apart at a seam. and ironing or steaming them is a must. this blouse was no exception. it went back because of pulling at the bust. i'm willing to take some extra care of my clothing out of my busy schedule  but i shouldn't have to! 5'7"""
-1,This is not a kimono. it's a cocoon. there's a huge difference.  it's also not made very well.
-1,This top is really cute  but the threads underneath the shirt scratch your torso. i suggest wearing a tank underneath to protect your skin.
0,I ran to the store to try to this on after seeing it online. i'm usually between a small and medium on tops depending on the shirt; the 6 fit true to size. everything about this shirt fit perfectly and it is beautifully designed  but it is just soooo sheer. i had a nude bra on and you could see every detail of it through both the front and back. i couldn't wear this comfortably without a cami. disappointing as i had the highest hopes for finding a crisp white shirt for the summer!
-1,I ordered this dress in my usual sz 2 it seemed to be tight on the hips   then i tried the next sz 4 and it was tight because  i realized that the lining was very sticky  and would bunch up underneath making the dress look defective on me  not for curvy on bottom. i think if you are more slim down below this will maybe work but i had to return for this reason. i was considering cutting out the lining because it was so cute  and i really liked the look of the dress  if it goes on sale i may purch
1,True to size  very pretty.  as pictured expect that it is more peachy and not this light.  i like it and will keep it but just be aware that it is not a pale pink as in the picture.
1,I saw this dress in the store tried it on and   love! it is so hard to find a white dress that is not too fancy or frilly. this dress fits great and flatters my full figure (size 12 to 14)  plus it has pockets! the woven material with the big fun flowers is accented by the plain band at the bottom which falls just above the knee. the center of the flower adds a nice three dimensional touch. i brought it in a large and i will wear this lovely feminine flirty beauty all spring and summer. from fun
-1,I really love the idea behind this. however  the fit doesn't work for me. i'm usually a s or xs in retailer tops  and i often go with xs for sleeveless tops. this one runs small though - the xs was a bit too small on me based on length and width. the neckline was very high (higher than it looks in the model photo) and the armholes were too big. so i don't think sizing up would improve matters much due to the armhole issue. the other criticism is that the front is not lined.
1,I bought the red motif for my summer wardrobe; i'll be on the road for most of the month of august and wanted to create a super comfortable capsule wardrobe that would launder without ironing. this top is well made  super soft  and works well with jeans  capris  skirts  and leggings due to its longer length over my posterior. i should have read the other reviews first though  this is a tad large and i needed to us invisible tape to keep everything from hanging out the front. i ordered a medium a
-1,I should have heeded the previous reviewer's advice. but i'm really short so i thought i'd give it a try. there is something really wrong with the bust. first  it's about 3-4 inches higher than it should be. the bottom trim cut across the middle of my bust. even if i hoisted everthing up in there to fit the cups  they are really only designed to fit cones  not curves. from the side it looked hideous. too bad  because the fabric and fit everywhere else is gorgeous.
0,I purchased the grey in a medium  i normally wear an 8 or 10 in tops  36 c.. i found it to fit quite well  but it has the shape that seems common at retailer lately in that it is shorter and more boxy. so if you have a longer torso(like me)  you may not be the happiest. i loved the lace and didn't have an issue with that area being sheer  but the non-lace part is very thin. i did try it on with a black bra and it was obvious i was wearing black all around  you could even see the width of th
1,Love this top-i love the colors  flow and that you can wear with a regular bra and straps are covered. i was torn between the xs and s but went with the s due to length. have already worn several times with a casual white jean summer skirt and crops. love love love.
0,The quality of this shirt is great and the colors are pretty. it just made me look super wide. i feel like the waist is too high - not quite empire and not quite at the waist. it just wasn't going to work for my body. maybe a different size would work but i don't like it enough to try.
0,I ordered a medium and it fit perfectly. i am anywhere from a size 6-8. 5'9  155lbs.  sadly  i am returning this dress because the horizontal stripes make my hips look huge.
-1,I brought this shirt for a vacation  it fitted well and was flattering. totally a comfortable wear  however  after 1 wash on delicate & hang dry small holes appeared near the bottom. i am hoping i can return it. not worth the money.
-1,It's a cute idea  but it's so low cut and the material is very thin. i was hoping to wear it as a cool  flowing summer top  but i'll have to layer it since my whole bra basically hangs out of it. i'm only keeping it because it was such a good price. also the buttons are super tiny and a little hard to fasten.
1,This dress runs a bit small in my opinion. for reference i'm a 36/38 c and usually a 10. the medium is tight at the bust. the material is beautiful but it looks like a petite cut on me. the sleeve and overall length are too short and i'm going to return it.
0,Material is gorgeous and soft but the fit is another story. i am a size 12/14 but very small busted. this suit is definitely meant for someone with a larger chest. the padding was so overwhelming. i also have a long torso so it just didn't really line up were the peplum should be. too bad. it's very pretty. but looked horrible.
0,It's not as form fitting & hour-glass shaped in real life as on the model. i think they must have clipped it in the small of her back so it does not look so boxy. otherwise it's nice.
0,I am ever in search of a light  white  summer top. this is not quite it. there are two distinct layers  and each of them is the scratchy  starchy type of gauze. it would just roast me in the summer sun--but i run fairly hot in general.
1,"I received this tee in grey as gift and immediately went online to buy another!  beware because the color names are confusing. i originally thought it was a mix up in the naming on the website so i ordered the ""red""  thinking i'd get the red colored tee. however  the ""red"" tee is actually a light orange color. the ""orange"" tee is actually a burgundy/red color.  i ended up keeping the orange colored tee although i actually wanted the red color  because i really do love the quality of this shirt!"
0,"Super long even at 5'7"" and a little too voluminous for my taste. incredibly comfortable and beautiful pattern though. i'm having a hard time imagining there getting much use for me  so even at the sale price they're going back."
-1,The wash on these jeans made my hips look twice as big. that in combination with the looser boyfriend cut was not flattering. quality was excellent. denim was thick with the right amount of stretch. unfortunately they had to go back.
-1,"I truly cannot understand the great reviews on this dress!  i purchased in both a sp and a mp.  i am 5'2"" 120#.  the mp fit perfectly.  i definitely wouldn't keep it though because it looks like someone sewed a bunch of old sweatshirts together.  it's not super soft  coarse on the inside  and feels old.  the back is longer than the front  it just looks like something my daughter would make in sewing class out of scraps.  even with leggings and great boots  it looks worn."
0,The pink version of this top finally arrived -- nearly 2 months after ordering.  the expected delivery date kept slipping.  the color is not as shown online.  online it looks like a light pink.  the actual top was more of taupe color.  it's a basic tee with pretty ruffling at the bottom.  not enough to keep.
-1,Beautiful shape and colors but the fabric felt heavier than i imagined. sort of like heavy drapes. also  the length (as others mentioned) was too long. i am not normally a petite but the regular was too long. unfortunately  it has to go back.
1,"If you think you can pull this off by all means try it. the fabric is excellent quality--thick yet soft  and the floral print is lovely (unlike a lot of the prints this season). i am not exactly short (5'6"") and not wide (34-26-36)  but this made me look like a houseboat. too bad  as it is such an interesting cut. i ordered down since i can sometimes wear an xs  but the bottom was still voluminous."
-1,"Alas  i so wanted to love this. the photos of the models wearing it look gorgeous -- flowy  drapey  ultimate grecian goddess. but it just doesn't work unless you're super-skinny. too much material. almost bulky; strange looking. the print is so beautiful -- i love the pink floral  and i love the whole idea of the dress. but it just doesn't work. have to send it back.     (i'm 5'6""  135 pounds  38-30-38  and i ordered a 10.)"
-1,Should have listened 2 a previous review! while this is a very well made garment  it really does remind me of a bathrobe  and will be returning :( too bad because the fabric and stripes are really great. also...this runs very large. the extra small was more like a medium.
0,"First off  the dress quality is great  the fabric is very nice  the color is great. i am 5'4""  150 lbs. the dress looked like a parachute on me  very unattractive  because the fabric is pretty stiff. i quite honestly looked pregnant."
1,I'll admit  it's been a few months since i've shopped at retailer. i feel like i have to try on just about everything because there doesn't seem to be much consistency between the brands. i'm so glad i wandered in our local store this week! this top is so beautiful in person and well-made. the embroidery is lovely and it's lined  so not too sheer. i'm tall and it was a good length  hitting just above the hip. i think it runs tts or maybe just a tad big. the s fit perfectly across the chest 
0,This is just okay for me. the top is soft and surprisingly flattering  especially from the side  but the front rides up and the neckline never lays flat. it washes well and the tan/white combo is cute  but a little transparent.
1,These got me so excited for fall. the teal is a color i'm really into right now and was the real reason i decided to order these. when they arrived though  i was delighted to find that they are light weight and have the perfect amount of stretch. the fit is snug  but hugs all the right places and are so comfortable! these will be a staple in my wardrobe. i want to order more colors!
-1,Review title says almost all. add to that that it is age appropriate  unlike other kedia dresses  for the very young. just too cute for words. i have all of the other tk peasant dresses and although youthful they are appropriate for anyone young of heart. this however  on an older woman  looks ridiculous. i would have liked it for those 9 months but even then it would cover quadruplets!
-1,Loved loved loved the shirt but...the material was so thin
-1,I loved the design and material of the test  but unfortunately it just did not fit me right. it was tight in the hips and did not have the relaxed look i was hoping for.   also the pattern did not look good on me.   unfortunately i had to return.
1,I love this sweater especially the color. i never would have order this sweater on line but when i saw it in person the color was more of a burnt orange. the fit was perfect. i can wear with skinny jeans or leggings.
1,I absolutely love this dress. it is super soft and flattering for my body type (petite and curvy). though  i wish it did come in petite  as the upper body part of the dress would fit a little better. but that didn't stop me from purchasing as that's an easy alteration. very flattering. love it.
-1,I just can't get past how different the blouse i got is from the photo. mine has dark colors  really dark colors.  this top fits a bit large and the neck is quite wide. i thought it flowed well and fit nicely in my regular size large. i liked the length and the fact that it's shorter than shown. it still covered my bum.  the back has a cute peplum ruffle and there are little bronze colored beads along the bottom edge in both the front and back. i would have kept it had been the blouse shown in t
0,I was so excited to receive this romper. it's a great material  but it's actually a bit drab. the colors are very bland and the flowers just hang. it's not flattering as it is very roomy.
-1,"Despite retailer's claim that they have ""fixed"" the button issue on this coat  beware. they haven't. i ordered this coat november 18th  feeling safe that the issue that scores of other reviewers had noted was fixed  because retailer indicated ""rest assured  this issue has been fixed"" (as noted in the item description). feeling confident that i'd get a non-defective coat at this late date in the quality assurance cycle  i was severely disappointed to open my shipment tonight (nov 24th) immediately di"
1,"I love elosie sleepwear  everything is well made and beautiful designs. i am 5'5"" and wear a size 4  the small fits great. i love the embroidery it is a nice touch  and the pink is a pretty contrast."
0,Embroidered tulips look like they were plucked when comparing the dresses in the product photos. took a chance any way  came out disappointed because i couldn't zip up the bodice. i hate side zips and when you pair a cheap zipper with delicate material  recipe for disaster! i am top and back heavy so though i lost weight and went down a cup size  my back is too wide for the 12p. for reference i'm 135# 36d 38/28/35.
1,This jumpsuit is the epitome of what i love about retailer! unique and absolutely beautiful. i love how it flows and on my petite frame when paired with heels makes me look taller. hopefully the designs for spring/summer are just as beautiful and comfortable as this piece. i plan to rock this with a cute belt and a bolo jacket.
-1,Too big and it's not secure enough to wear for swimming.
-1,"Ref: 5'4""  125# 27/4  32g. i don't think this is for us shorter women. this hits you right where you don't want a vertical line to hit. it flares out at your hip and makes you look shorter than you are. the fabric is like a double gauze and very soft and the colors are beautiful but i couldn't even dream of making this work. i thought maybe with my larger bust it would create shape but it looks like i just wrapped a bunch of fabric around me! glad i tried in-store and didn't online order."
-1,Extremely cute sweater  but after having worn it twice it's already pilling up. i'd expect more for a $100 sweater.
0,I loved this but couldn't believe how small it was.
0,This dress  it is heartbreakingly gorgeous  stunning. the entire idea and design is so gorgeous! the style with the sleeves  embroidery and slight shimmer at the top  two layers underneath  the dress is extremely gorgeous. i am so so so sad i could not keep it. i don't get why the sizes are so off here. i have come across so many clothes with gorgeous embroidery but too loose or too tight. i didn't want to send this dress back but it did not look good. it was just too loose. sad!!
1,Light and flows so nicely. a great length--not to short or long. great with shorts. material is lovely.
0,I was surprised at the high quality of fabric; however  the dress looked like a muumuu on. maybe with a belt it would be cuter...
1,"This is a stunning  flattering  well-designed and sized  magnificent  and yet wearable  comfortable summer blouse! i am a busty  34f  size 8  and this lovely piece makes me look amazing. i most highly recommend to any woman. the 100% cotton body has a very soft feeling and a little bit of ""give"". i experienced no pulling at the chest or back  which can happen for me. the bottom 2"" of the crochet v is backed by the body of the top  so you may not need a cami. the combination of leaf print/crochet"
-1,I was so excited to get this dress since it look so pretty on line but unfortunately the it was horrendous on. the model must have the dress tailored because it looks like a huge tent on me. it was very wide bust down and made me look 30 lbs heavier. i'm 5'4 and 125 lbs- ordered extra small and it fits bust up and arms so i say it's tts up top.
-1,I saw this online and went to the store to try it on. so glad i did! it did not work on me at all! it is so wide - just did not look right. it was also not flattering at the neckline either. i thought it was beautiful until i had it on! too bad - wanted to love it!
1,Fell in love with this romper online  but since a few reviewers mentioned it ran large  i wanted to try it on in the store. this romper is even better in person! extremely flattering  delicate details and lined! it's adorable! i am glad i tried it on in the store. i am usually a size 6/medium  but the small worked better for me. i know this will be a staple of mine all spring and summer.
0,I'd been wanting the blouse for quite a while but hesitated based on reading reviews. when it went on sale i thought i'd try but it was like a tent on me. the fabric was pretty but just hung without any resemblance to photo. too bad because the color was gorgeous & could have been a favorite of looked like photo.
-1,Really cute sweater  well made  but so intensely itchy i couldn't keep it on for more than 30 seconds !
1,"Absolutely love this dress. it is perfect for the summer. yes it wrinkles but that does not take away from how cute the dress is. the style is so unique  love the pleats. i am 146lbs  5'6"" 36dd and the size 8 fits perfectly. not tight through the arms holes or the bust area. the dress hangs perfectly  you can dress it up or where it to run errands."
0,"I have to say being a silk lover  decision was hard to make. the quality is phenomenal. i do agree to a reviewer that said it's pj like. i tried it with belt  didn't help much with the look somehow. it just felt empty. my daughter who i usually turn for opinions said ""ewww  grandma""... i know  truth hurts.    i can't exchange for a smaller size either because the fabric is not stretchy and i'm afraid the extra small would confine my arm movement. on top of that  the background is more peachy tha"
1,This is theoretically a great summer top addition to your wardrobe. i love the floral print - it's bold and lively primary colors on a black background. i'm usually a size small in retailer tops and neither the small nor the medium fit me very well. the small was a bit too fitted everywhere and strangely  the medium gapes at the front when i'm sitting but not standing (i'm 34b otherwise height-weight proportionate with broad shoulders). another reviewer mentioned a design flaw - the floral print i

0,As other reviewers have pointed out  the bum is not flattering. the pockets are wide and the fit sort of flattens you out. bummer. literally. too bad  i wanted these to work more than then coh's parker cropped. the coh's win. my wallet loses.
-1,I built a new wardrobe around the three lovely velvet blazers: moss  copper and burgundy. they are soft  well-fitting  pretty linings and very satisfactory. this new version is stiff material  and ill-fitting. not coming in petite is a problem and it may fit others better  but it is too full across the front. with the stiff materials  this is a bad fit. disappointing and going back.
-1,This jacket looks like such the statement piece online with the soft focus lens  but in reality...meh. i think the pattern is gorgeous and would have worked without the studs. and the studs are unique and would have worked on a simple solid color. but put them together and you have the unwanted love child of a laura ashley bag and a marching band jacket. to me  it all felt more cloying than clever.    the quilted fabric and boxy cut of the jacket also makes it unwieldy and uncomfortable. since i
1,I adore this dress. i bought a little over a month ago and have already worn it many times- rare for me. it is so easy to throw on and yet it's stylish and flattering- i don't have the time or energy i used to get dressed up so i love this. when i bought it  it was knotted on one side in the front. that's the only way i wear it now. it just adds something to it and gives it more shape. i've washed it several times (laid flat to dry) and it has held up well. i'm definitely bookmarking this to buy
1,This top is cute! it adds a pop of color to my day and seems to be of high quality. the colors seem more vibrant in person and the material is quite soft and stretchy. as another reviewer pointed out  the peplum is only in the front! it sounds really weird but i don't really mind the look because i'll be wearing a jacket over it. i'm usually a size 12/14 with a 36dd bust and the large fits beautifully.
0,This shirt has beautiful coloring but the material wasn't as soft as i thought it would be. i was hoping they would be the super soft material  maybe washing them would help  but i didn't want to chance it so i returned them.
1,I saw the tank at the store and was so glad to try it on. i got the small?i'm in between xs and s (34b) and try to get petites when i can but the small fit great with a longer cut. i bought the green and did not find it sheer. i actually thought it was thicker than most tanks and tees these days. i found the arm holes were fine. i usually need to go with a petite just for this reason but no need to this time. planning on getting a couple of more colors!
1,"In accordance with other reviewers  the pictures don't do this gorgeous lightweight sweater justice; the fabric has threads of gold  silver  and black that together make for shimmery elegance--not at all the heather grey in the photo.. i'm 5' 8"" 120 34b and the xs (regular) fits perfect--and actually more slimming/fit than in the photo. sleeves are long--which i love. a keeper  especially on sale!"
1,"Prior reviewer nailed it with the summary of this dress. it definitely needs heels. i'm 5'4""  120#  34d and this is a size 36. i usually wear a size s or 4 with most retailer stuff."
-1,The fabric is too sheer  also looks like sleepwear. just not my thing.
0,This dress is very cute on. very flouncy. i know it looks like a gingham dress  but it's a more like a silk dress with a gingham pattern. the one issue i had was that it ballooned out at the back where you tied it on any size (bug or small)  and i am larger on top  so i don't know what would happen with someone with a small chest. i wouldn't have minded if it did the same thing on the front  but it was just the back.
1,This is my third dress-the first one was the right size  but the plaid fell on the dress in an awkward way. the second one was a size too small  but this one is perfect! i am wearing it with a belt and loving it!
-1,Loved the look of this sweater online. was disappointed when i took it out of the package i was surprised at how stiff and itchy it was. i ordered my usual medium and though at first they shipped the wrong size it was small all over.  it felt cheep definelty not worth the high price. knew it was definitely going back
0,Super large and a very weird cut.  the sides were much shorter than the front and back and this just looked awful on me.
0,This is a lovely dress  with great fabrication. nice detail on the zipper placket. good material. however  it runs small in the waist  if you had a nymph waist this is for you! i couldn't get it zipped.
-1,I tried this dress on at my local store and was very disappointed in the slip portion of this dress. there is no give with the slip so even though the dress portion is quite flowy the slip prevents anyone with a large chest or hips to wear this dress.
-1,"This dress was too cute to pass up! i loved it online but when i got it home  it was so tight i couldn't zip up my normal size. the length was perfect on me being 5'7"". the fabric and detail was beautiful. if you have a bust  order a size up. beautiful dress just really snug up top."
1,I love this shirt for its subdued colors and casual style. it is lighter in weight than a flannel shirt but retains a feeling of softness. it is from cloth and stone  a brand i like. usually i buy that brand in a small because their shirts run large for me. i liked this shirt so much i ordered it twice and waited for a backorder. i sent the small size back and was lucky enough to get a medium before the next out of stock situation.
0,I am so bummed. these jeans are the perfect weight  totally distressed (and torn) in a way that looks like you've owned them for years  they flare out at the bottom of the legs just the right amount...but there is one huge - or i should write small - problem: your thighs have to be incredibly small to get these pulled all the way on.   ----------  i am a 27 in level 99 and ag brand jeans  and a 28 in my other pairs of coh jeans and in mih jeans as well. i do not have an hourglass figure (my shou
0,"Beautifully made. beautiful drape. deep  blue. so long tho i have to role it up at the waist so nix on tucking a white blouse in. why is it so long???? in 5'6"" and got a large. with 2 inch heels i still trip and not about to wear really high herls.   ill keep it tho because its a nuce dressy skirt. may take it to be hemmed but the last item i got hemmed ended up an uneven mess"
1,This caught my eye straight away and it hasn't disappointed on either. really unique and i imagine it will suit many different occasions. high quality and slimming vertical stripes too.
0,I loved the lines in this jacket  but ended up returning it because they didn't show up how i expected. the jacket had a surprisingly baggy fit (s on my usual s/4/6) and wasn't quite what i was looking for.
1,Thank goodness i packed this on a recent trip to adirondacks because it kept me warm in the cool mountain weather. i love gray so i was drawn to this open stitch sweater. it is a boxy bulky look but a great layering piece. most bulk is in front  so it can camouflage areas. i wore this over a gray and black flannel plaid shirt. perfect!
0,This cute dress was very nice on. however my only reservations were the thickness in the arm sleeves. the dress has this thick curtain like material on the sleeves that seemed to big and cut way to wide for my skinny arms. i thought about bringing this to the tailor but i feel it would be a lot of work and the bulkiness of the arms would just be the same.  other than that the colors and dress are beautiful.
-1,"Beautiful floral print and while i like the concept of this dress it was a total failure for me. where the knit meets the print hit me at the top of my bust  truly a disastrous look for a bustier figure since the fabric just drapes down and made me look much larger than i actually am. same with the arms  if the white knit had carried down to the elbow it would have elongated the arms instead of cutting them off mid biceps to make them look like giant hams. i'm 5'6"" and a classic size 8 and this"
0,I love these pants. like  obsessively love  like didn't want to take them off to wash them  love. annnnd i wish i hadn't because they came out of a delicate cycle cold water wash with a huge part of the leg seam ripped apart like a spider web. maybe i just got a bad pair  but i wasn't prepared to have to patch them after one wash for the price.
-1,This looked like a simple  chic blouse  but the fabric felt cheap to me  like thin lining fabric. the neckline is too deep and wide as well and so not flattering.
1,Cute top  a little less fitted than i was expecting.
0,I had been eyeing this top for weeks. it's look so beautiful on the model  however  not great on me. material is fab. the tee is way shorter than it appears online and there is too much flutter material.
0,Yes  it's a swing top  just like many of the other swing tops retailer is offering this season. i find this silhouette unflattering on me  being top heavy  so i was frustrated to discover the swing-ness only after i ordered it and it arrived at my house. it also runs huge  with big gaping arm holes. the sleeves are cute and fluttered. the black panels on the sides are semi-sheer. it is a pretty boxy top  which the photo doesn't seem to capture. order at least a size smaller than usual.
1,For once i found a peasant top that wasn't a balloon. i'm 5'1 and curvier on top and the small fit great. the blouse billowed a bit but it didn't make me look like a hot air balloon. the pattern of the blouse  a mix of various floral swatches  is very pretty. the blouse will look great with black skinny jeans and boots for fall. i can't wait to wear it!
1,"This cardigan can be dressed up with leggings and booties or dressed down with jeans and chucks. i love the fit of the small (5''3"" and small/medium build). would highly recommend for a dinner out or lounging around at home."
1,I love wearing this. it is a little slice of summer  which i am desperately hanging on to. the color pops  it's so very comfortable  & the back is a work of art! can be dressed up with a pencil summer skirt  or down with capri style pants.
-1,So this may be my least favorite thing i have ever bought from retailer. this top had so much extra material it was like wearing a bag or parachute. it looked a million times cuter in the photos.
-1,I ordered this top online during the mother's day sale  thinking i had found the perfect white staple tank i wanted for summer. i had this top on for barely five seconds before i knew it was going straight back. the quality of the fabric and the overall design are both very good. but the problem is that the top comes with an under-layer up top. this is normally a good thing; extra coverage in a sumer top generally means you ca go braless. the problem is that the top layer of the shirt is so shee
0,"I'm usually a petite  but bought in regular xs. perhaps a petite would have worked better  but this was way too low cut in front and back. i did not like the way it hung on me at all. i'm 5;2"" and 105 lbs  but regular xs normally fits better than this did. i could barely keep the shoulders from slipping off. sorry  it's a return for me."
-1,I should have listened to the reviews that said this top was too boxy  but i didn't believe them and bought it anyway. i was wrong! this top is so boxy and wide  just awful.
0,I agree with the other reviewer that the color of this top is more burgundy with purple undertones rather than a deep red like shown online. the fit was very boxy on me and it did not look flattering. i was not willing to to have it altered so i returned it.
0,"I loved the rich navy blue color with the accent pockets. the fabric was a nice weight  not too thin like lots of retailer tops. i liked the top from the front  however the back was way too long  especially with the looseness of the style. it would have been much better if it were not so much longer in the back and maybe a little more fitted. it might work on someone taller. i'm 5'3"" and 120 lbs. and i tried xs."
-1,I ordered my usual size m and when arrived i thought the material and cut was nice.  once i tried it on it was way too big in hips.  i looked rather comical how it extended on the sides.  i returned the dress.
1,Love the colors! love the stripes! great shape! great style! but...i am normally a 12 on top...and this pulled across my back...so i have it in for an exchange for a 14. sometimes i have to do that...i have a broad back. we will see how it fits! but what an adorable shirt!
0,Cute dress to throw on and go. fits pretty true to size except for the slip underneath. it's a little tight and i felt to short for the dress. i ended up wearing a full slip i had under it and that work great!
0,I was really excited to receive this dress. it's a fun concept and different from anything else i have. however  the dress was way too short on me. i'm 5 ft 6 in.  and the size medium was way too short. given the thin nature of the material  i did not feel comfortable keeping the dress  even for wearing it outside the office. i will have to return this dress.
0,"I love the style and the look of this sweater. i wanted to love it and keep it but could not because the itchiness was too much. the style looks so comfortable and easy going  but it was not  it was clingy around the waist and backside. for reference  i am 5ft 4in and 128b and i ordered the small - the sleeves were too long on me  not ""cool"" long like some other sweaters this season."
-1,This should have been cute  but the fabric choice + ruching design made me look like i had elephant skin rippling around my waist -- super unflattering.
-1,When i saw this top online  i thought i'd love it and immediately ordered it in both colors.  they arrived today and i am soooo disappointed.  i have never seen such drab colors.  the blue is a muddy grayish hue (like an overcast day) and the pink is a dusty shade of peach.  yuck.  and i was hoping the ruffle at the bottom would have a chiffon-like flowy effect.  instead  the ruffle is made of a cheap looking knit.  back these go...
0,Nice lines  just a bit tight if you have larger / more muscley shoulders.
-1,I looked at this dress for a long time before i purchased it because of the money. i wear a size 2p. was entirely disappointed in the style and construction of this dress. for one thing the lining is bulky and you could never wear it in warmer weather without burning up. the dress as pictured looks very feminine and light weight silk but there is just too much material going on--- thick and heavy. the overall fit was too big and very unflattering.
1,The blouse is lightweight and is double layered  meaning a light layer over a lower layer. it's not bulky and not super flowy...just enough. i'm 5'1  a bit busty  and generally wear a m in retailer and this blouse fit great. it's figure flattering and not boxy. may be a tad short for taller women.
-1,This product has a terrible zipper that ultimately caused me to return the dress. it's pretty bad when it won't even zip up on the hanger. such a beautiful dress; it broke my heart!
-1,I had high hopes for this dress but my husband said i looked pregnant and that i was wearing a tablecloth- and he was right! i'm usually a size 10 so perhaps this would look good on a talk lanky person with a very long torso... but probably not. way too much fabric around the midsection. it's a shame because the fabric was really pretty  but too stiff a hand to drape well.
0,"I bought this for an upcoming conference and was grateful that it shipped very promptly.  it runs quite large  in my opinion. i'm 5'7"" and about 130-135lbs. the small was huge on me in the chest and shoulders/arms. the stomach also wasn't very fitted. the material is thinner than i expected (you can see through the dress to some extent when you hold it up to the light)  but i don't think this is a problem  necessarily. had it been thicker  it probably would be too warm. but you might need a slip"
-1,The length in the front is too short and the bottom flares a lot which is really unflattering. i love the top half of the shirt but the bottom half should be more form fitting.
0,"Based on other reviews that this top ran large  i ordered this online in two sizes. both seemed to fit alright in my chest (although the chest fit tighter in the smaller size)  and both were much too big on the bottom. the front bottom of this shirt has a series of pleats  so the bottom of this top really  really  really flared out away from my hips. the length seemed fine on me (5'10""). the material is very thin  and i could see my nude bra through the white pattern."
0,I loved the color of these but they bagged out with just one wear. they are going back to store.
0,This top looks good on model and has great reviews online. however it did not work on my bodytype. when i tried it the slit in the front sat too low. i don't like showing cleavage because i dress conservatively. other than that i would have loved wearing it. arm cut is not too big such it shows sides of bra bands. overall fit is loose and drapery.
1,I am 5'5  150lb  generally size medium shirt  size 6 or 8 pants and bought a size 8. i have had two c-sections so my stomach has some problem areas  which can be easily highlighted in a swimsuit- not this one! i felt good  it hid my problem spots  showed off curves and stays in place! i can't speak to the durability of it yet  however  it makes me feel great  and that is tough when i am in a bathing suit. that in itself makes it worth the price! try it!
-1,Again  bought this while wearing my retailer colored glasses. i loved the flowiness and color of the dark pink  and was convinced in the dressing room that this top made me look like a chic goddess  mid-vacation on the amalfi coast. i tried it on at home  and it straight up looked like i was wearing a maternity top. since i'm not with child  this one's going back!
-1,The shirt is cute  but there is no way that the length posted on the website is correct--it's a crop top. this was returned.
-1,Gals  if you absolutely must have this top wait for it to go on sale (don't worry  it will). between the poor fit and the polyester  i have no good things to report about it. this is very much below retailer's usual quality and style.
1,"This is a nice sweater. very soft and while cardigans are not normally flattering on me  i found this one to be slimming. for reference i am 170 lbs 5'8"" and a size medium or 10."
0,Loved the style and color/design but this dress was simply too short in the front. the slip was also slightly tight over hips. i wish this was longer!
1,I saw this and had to have it!  it is so beautiful.  it has pops of color that can be paired with so many options.  i like the uniqueness of the flowers being on the backside.  it is thinner fabric  so i will have to wear a black cami underneath but i have no problem with that.  especially  going into cooler weather anyway.  it is very flattering on.  this one will go fast.  thank you retailer!
1,The material is very soft and the lace has a beautiful design. it looks very elegant and romantic. you will need a racer back bra to wear with it though  because of the design of the straps. it is very flowing and i think the cut is flattering. the material in the back is slightly transparent so you might want to wear a tank underneath. overall  very pretty and i would highly recommend. (i purchased the white and yellow version.)
0,Wore this romper 1x and after washing  the hem on one of the shorts/legs completely unraveled. if i want to ever wear it again  i will have to bring it to a tailor to get fixed. unacceptable for a $200 product. cute design and good fit but questionable quality.
0,"I'll start with what i loved  this dress is made with a really beautiful  quality material. the material is gorgeous in person and the dress is lined which is really nice. however the fit is just so very strange. i am 5'6"" and curvy. i tried both a medium and a small (for reference i usually take a medium or large/ size 8 or 10) the medium was so large and too roomy around the arms and chest (i'm 34 d) the small was too tight. the v neck lay in a very strange way and i'm not sure it would have b"
-1,I ordered this sweater in the pink color in a small and xsmall  in order to see which was the best fit. i was really looking forward to getting it because it looked so great online - like it had a nice flow  the cute zipper and was a good match for a pink and grey skirt that i have. i was really disappointed  the sweater doesn't flow like it does in the picture - it kind of billows out in the front and back and isn't flattering. i have a small build  and  frankly  i usually look good in sweaters
-1,I initially liked the feel and quality of the top but once it was on it was much shorter and looser than the picture of the model. it flowed out from my chest with one central pleat in the front and my husband said it made me look pregnant. then came the tedious task of taking it off with such a snug fit in the shoulders. i'm regularly a size 2/xs  32d and 120 lbs and both size 2 and 4 did not work for me.
1,The material is great!! got them in both colors and went with a tall size for one. everyone compliments them!
0,Very cute and would transition well season to season with different boots/booties.  didn't lay well on chest for me.  returned it.
-1,"I absolutely loved the patterns and colors of this skirt  if only the cut wasn't so odd. the sides of the skirt ""wing out"" for a very distracting and unflattering look. the stiff  felt-like quality of the material only makes matters worse. in that respect  the model photos are not at all accurate. it also runs large. i had to go down one full size."
1,I really love this sweater. i normally wear an 8 and bought a 12. even it is a little snug. but it really is very cute! can't wait to wear it with black leggings and boots.
1,"I have a short torso and short arms  so i purchased this in a petite medium. i probably could've worn the ps  but i do like the little extra room. it is a classic shirt dress with just enough of today's trendy ""frayed edge"" to make it contemporary. the fabric is super soft and lays nicely. i can imagine wearing this through the seasons with a variety of shoes/legwear & accessories! looking forward to it."
0,I took a chance on this top because i liked the style. i prefer natural fibers like cotton and linen. this is rayon and spandex. sure  why not at least give it a shot and go outside my box?! if the fabric would have been my preference  it would have been a keeper. i did not like the feel  nor the semi-sheer quality. maybe it would work for you  but not for me. back it went.
0,I read the reviews and everyone loved them so ordered them online. for me  they are a no. i thought the fabric was cheap and the quality not so great compared to typical retailer items.
1,"Although this is not my husband''s favorite (he prefers things a little more tailored). i absolutely adore this! i got this in the ivory/cream color not realizing they had it in two more colors. i just ordered the blue. i loved the way the size small fit (not as wide)  but the medium for my height (5'7"") fit better and was longer. if i want to wear it as a dress  i could. i highly recommend this!! well made and looks great!!!"
1,I always chuckle when i see this dress because it looks so busy and so crazy with all the mixed prints  i think it's a lot of fun. not so fun to put on  but it's worth the trouble. i swear my shoulders are sore after manipulating this on myself. i also own the mona dress in 8p  but i had to size down to a 6 for the melodist because the hips were not fitted enough and the back bloused out too much.
0,Just a warning  the yoke on this dress has sequins underneath. i'm not a sparkle kinda gal  so as soon as i saw that  the dress went right back in the package and will be going back to the store. i wish that had been described or more evident in the pictures  to me  it cheapens the whole dress  which would otherwise be adorable.
1,I was attracted to this sweater because of it's unique style. i really love it. it looks just like the picture. it is of good quality  as is the leather belt. it is the perfect fall sweater and i love that it's different. i highly recommend this sweater.
-1,"This may be the ugliest dress with the worst fit i have ever tried. the blue stripes are brighter than they appear in the photo  absolutely garish. the top is baggy with awful beads on the back ties  it just looks cheap. the skirt is an antebellum nightmare.    i did not even want to try it on  it's that bad. i considered adding a photo  but was too horrified.  for reference  i'm 5'10""  approximately the height/ size of the model  but it was shorter than the photo depictes. i wanted to like it "
-1,I ordered the ivory of this dress  expecting it to be a nice dress i could wear into my second trimester of pregnancy. instead  i received a dress that looks like a ugly  vintage-gone-wrong curtain of fabric. the 'ivory' is the color of yellowed newspapers. the fabric was cheap and had thread pieces sticking up all over the place. i would've been better off sewing myself a dress out of drapes a la gone with the wind or sound of music. the fit isn't that great  either. big and boxy. it could acco
-1,Loved the look of this shirt online. i tried it on and was sad to see that the frontal view is all wrong. the cool shoulder design is almost too exaggerated (almost looks as if i'm ready for take off!). unfortunately  none of the featured photos on the product page display the frontal view of the model. i really wish the shoulder design was slightly smaller in shape and size - i would have loved it! looks great from the side but sadly i can't walk around like that ;)
1,Absolutely love this top! i've been on the lookout for a cute cotton top  something that'd be ideal for summertime. this beautiful piece doesn't disappoint. the color pairing - white cotton base and lovely red thread embroidery - looks stunning. not the mention the unique back detailing makes it a must-have. highly recommend.
1,What more could you want than a dress that slips on easily  hugs all the right places and skims the others  feels like pajamas  and looks great for any occasion? i am about 120  5'-1'  32 dd  usually a 4 petite. i ordered the petite small in navy and it fits just like the model photos. i tried it on in the store in a regular small and x-small  and could have gone with either  but the petite had better proportions  especially where the v-neck hit (i would have had to wear a very low plunge bra wi
1,"This is a love at first sight item! bought that home after seeing it on the model. very soft and lovely! especially love the tie back! i wore it with a t shirt underneath. i am 5'4"" and size small. i bought xs and still a bit long. wish they have petite at the store."
1,These are beautiful and very comfy. they do run very large. i ordered the green in medium and deciding wether to exchange for a small. the washing instructions in the pants are to dry clean for best results. the description needs to be updated to reflect this.
0,First  the good: i like the basic shape of the jacket  with its crisply cut lapels  and rounded corners at the bottom...the functional pockets (including the  cool watch pocket)  the size of the buttons  the color. i got the honey   and it was lovely and intense . now  the bad:  i got the regular 8. the jacket is at least an inch too short. although it's  a small  tight 8  the sleeves are strikingly too long. they would have to  be folded  and the lining which would show is not that attractive.
1,This top is awesome!! it is feminine and flattering at the same time! the color also makes it a little romantic. i will wear it with jeans or very a little dressier night out  black pants. buy this and you will not be disappointed!
0,I tried this on in my usual size and it was tight through the chest because of the lining. i would have preferred to wear a cami beneath and then it may have worked. the color and pattern are gorgeous  the fabric feels a bit weird  kind of dry and rough? would have liked to see this in a longer length  and more tapered. it is an absolute pregnant top. so sad its so pretty!
-1,I'm worried about the quality of the shirt. it looks like it may snag easily. i've decided to keep it  so hopefully i will get some use out of it. in hindsight i would have not bought it when considering the price and quality of the shirt.
1,Great quality and extremely flattering. bonus that it is on sale. i felt like this dress was a godsend. i am five months pregnant and needed a dress that made me feel comfortable but not frumpy. i think i'll get a lot of mileage out of it  as there's enough stretch to get me through the next few months and then (hopefully!) i can wear it after too. also can be dressed up or down  so appropriate for many occasions. i believe it runs true to size (i sized up  from xs to s  for obvious reasons  but
0,I just received these jeans and the fit it good. but they smell like moth balls and i have washed them twice already. i hope it will go away  otherwise i wasted $100.
-1,I almost ordered this online to wear to a party later this week  but i'm glad i waited to try it on at the store (i wasn't sure if i'd like the length of the petite or regular better.) i was so disappointed and didn't end up getting either! i have two bailey 44 dresses from several years ago that are much more flattering and incredibly soft/comfortable. this fabric on this dress was much rougher and it really bothered me that the stripes cut off at the side seams and then don't match up from the
-1,This looks like the perfect easy sweater with the white shirt appeal to it  but sadly the fit of this number is really off. it looks more like a tent. it must have been clipped in the back or something. i cannot see any scenario in which this would look good...
1,I just love this top  it has a flattering cut  fun summer colors! i purchased the white and paired it with the plata chevron skirt. both pieces go with everything and can be dressed up or down. perfect for traveling. only tricky part for me was reaching all the buttons in the back. highly recommend!! stock more pieces like this retailer!
0,The colors on this jacket are a murky blue with a pale mauve tone for the lighter color. size is a bit on the large size. i did not feel that the jacket was that well-made and would hold up to much wear. i was looking for a jacket to dress up jeans  black pants etc and this did not fit that need. it would be a warm jacket if that is a need.
0,In the photo and from far away this top looks more elegant than it truly is. wearing it feels like something better suited for sleeping in. it's a sweatshirt with the sleeves torn off and raw edges  which looks rather cheap and sloppy.
1,I am usually a 00 or 0 in dresses  and i ended up with a 4 in this one. i could barley zip up the 0  and while i could have gotten away with the 2  there is no elasticity in the waistband. the 4 is very slightly roomy  but more comfortable than the smaller sizes on me. for reference  i'm 109-111 lbs  5'4  and a 30b.     when i was finally able to wear the dress  i got compliments galore. it really is a beautiful dress! just be sure to size up!
1,I'm petite and pear shaped so i'm small on top and curvy around the hips and love the way this dress fits. it's a relaxed fit so it's not super fitted and it's loose around the waist which is great. it's a wonderful casual dress to wear with a pair of tall boots. i adore it!
1,"This sweater dress is beautifully unique in that it has lovely sheer sleeves to dress it up  but it's made of a soft sweater material that feels comfortable  warm and wintry at the same time. it does run true to size  i ordered a small (5'5"" and 118 lbs). knitted and knotted has come up with some killer sweater dresses this season!!!"
1,This skirt fits amazing. i run between a s and m in bottoms and went with the s. there is a little give in the fabric which is always a plus. this will surely become a staple in my wardrobe.
1,When i received this blouse  ai noticed that there were gold dots all over the blouse and they were very sticky. some of the fabric would stick to these dots. i thought it was because the weather was sticky and humid. however  after hanging on my closet door  the dots are still sticky. i do love the design and fabric so i will try not to let the sticky dots bother me.
0,Runs a little small in the shoulders/bust
0,I ordered this in both the white and navy colors - navy being what looks like an ivory background with navy spots. when i received the blouse  the background on the navy is actually a light grey/beige color that makes the whole top look kind of dingy. when ordering the navy version  be aware that the product images don't show the true background color on the top!
1,I know a lot of folks thought this top was too big/boxy  but i'm pretty slim up top with a big booty (quintessential pear shape)  and i think the shape is totally flattering. your mileage may vary  but with free returns i'd just try it on first.  i sized down one size  which helped  and got the raspberry  colored one. i adore the color -- it's impossibly vibrant  and beautiful for spring summer or fall. the eyelets don't have any cloth underneath  just bare skin   but they're so small that i don
-1,Too wide! the design is cute but the wideness of the overall piece and arms made me lose my shape. you can't see your figure underneath at all. i don't like pieces like that. this went back.
-1,I was so excited to get this dress...i even paid expedited shipping! i read the reviews and thought that i ordered properly but i sadly disappointed. it was just too big. i'm a size 6-8 petite and the size 8 was overwhelming. the side of the dress were down to my stomach and i just can't wear the dress. not sure what to do but buyers be careful. pretty color and design but not well-designed.
1,Love the colors and design of this lace-printed top but didn't realize it's not lined. the description says its polyester lace with polyester lining so i assumed it was lined and when you look at the photos  there is a lining under the top. the arm holes are slightly cut-in both front and back so it will be rather difficult to find a camisole with thin straps with a similar cut so they don't show. other than that  it's a beautiful  unique summer top.
0,Colors washed me out  i need more vibrant colors. so cute on the model
1,This top is absolutely adorable  fits small on top and then flares out a bit as shown. i bought it months ago and haven't worn it yet though. might try it with white jeans as shown.
-1,I really wanted to love these  i bought them in a rush because i needed to replace my skinny jeans asap. they were a little long and didn't quite hug my calves but i figured with hemming they would be fine. i was told they wouldn't stretch out much. well  they fit great at the waist but the legs are now huge on me and i can't get them to shrink. wish i spent a little more on a different skinny jean. too late to return  so my hoping to be going out jeans are now lazy day jeans.
1,I love this jess. i got it in the blue gray color  and i think it's going to be great for spring and will work into summer as well. cloth and stone is always one of my favorite brands and this dress is so soft. i'm thinking that i'm going to belt it to give it some more shape but i like how it looks unbelted as well
-1,Colors and patterns of this dress are beautiful and that's where it ends. cheap flimsy polyester and no lining. far too expensive for what it is. on me it bulked out in my chest area and did not look so great. i would say it runs a tad big but in my case ( i have wide shoulders) not big enough to downsize. too bad because i really love the colors and idea of this dress.
1,This dress just feels and looks amazing. i love how it isn't too short like a lot of new styles. i think it will be wonderful with leggings or tights in the winter. i also love the plaid cuff detail. the only drawback is the buttons need to be reinforced. i got home and realized one button was missing. i went to the store to swap for a new one and when i went to cuff the arms  2 buttons popped off!
1,This is even cuter in person than it is in the picture. it was hanging on a rack by the dressing room  so i tried it on on a whim and loved it! so  so soft too! runs true to size. i am 5'2 and 125 and got a small.
1,"This. jumpsuit. is. amazing.    i ordered the small  and it fits perfectly - loose and flowy  with room for boobs (i'm a 32d) and hips. perfect for humid summers when you'd rather your clothing hang a bit away from your body. the fabric is deceptively light for how it hangs (in a very flattering way) when i have it on.     i would say that if you're shorter than 5'4""  the petite is the way to go. however  i am 5'4"" and the length hit me almost exactly where it is on the model. i lifted the leg a"
0,This sweater is big and box. it looks very similar on as it does on the model. as other reviewers have mentioned  the embroidery on the shoulders is a bit itchy.
0,I really like the sundry brand. however. this is thin and to me out of character for an retailer tee. it look adorable in picture. however the coloring is way off. the navy is almost black it's so dark and the kaki stripe is a green. it's nothing like i had hoped it would be. fabric in very thin and more like a pajama top. so disappointed. it will go back. i do not make it a habit to bash a product. however with tax  shipping and 83.00 price tag. 103.11 is absolutely terrible.
0,This blouse is super cute but oddly sized. i bought a size up and still i squeezed into the top around the bust. the front slit is too low and shows a bit too much cleavage  so this had to go back. i really tried because the fabric is wonderful and the shirt is light and breezy for summer  i just couldn't make it work  .
1,I really like the red version of this shirt. it will add a pop of color under a blazer for work or it can be easily accessorized with a necklace  for the weekend. i am 137 lbs  a 34d chest and the small fit me perfectly.
-1,Ordered on line and thought these are a great quality as i pulled them out of the box. tried them on and found minimal elastic for the waist. within minutes of wearing  the waist fell down past my hips...glad i was at home. looks cute but will not stay up.
-1,I was so so excited to get this sweater in the mail. unfortunately  the sweater is lined with the same material (very soft and warm btw) as the polka dots  which sheds like crazy. i wore a white tshirt under this for the first time  and my shirt was covered in black fuzz by the end of the day. so much so that i was gathering balls of it to be thrown away. very disappointed. a lint roller can't even clean up the tshirt.  in terms of sizing  this fits tts  i normally wear a l or xl  got this in an
0,I got the pink version. it is a pretty color  but the metallic border is painted  not a metallic yarn. the weave is wide and it looks like it would snag easy. it looks cheap to me--not what i expect from retailer. am returning.
1,"I am normally a size medium or small at retailer (depending on the bust) and could not even get the medium in this top past my neck. it runs very small. unfortunately the size large was not in stock for me to try. truthfully  i might have needed the xl in this - it runs that small. for reference  i am 5'6""  145 lbs  34dd. also  the beading on the top i tried was coming loose and some was already missing. seems to be a common fault based on what other reviewers have said."
0,"Just received pants and even though they are labeled ""petite"" they are not. the inseam is 28 for a waist size 26  which is not what the description states."
0,This runs a bit on the large side. i ordered my usual m and had room to spare. the green color was lovely  but between the fit and the scratchy fabric  this is headed back. too bad!
1,"For the last two years  i have only purchased clothing for myself if it is secondhand  but then i saw this skirt and succumbed to temptation. first of all  the print is gorgeous! i'm a sucker for blue and white anything so it wasn't that hard of a sell. as other reviewers have mentioned  the seams line up! this kind of quality is so hard to find in clothing items anymore and really makes the skirt seem much more pricey than it really is (if you're buying it on sale like i did). i'm 5'3"" and will"
-1,I loved the look of this blouse online. i really wanted a cute eyelet top for summer. the blouse looked great out of the package but the fit was not good. i am a 00p and 32 b bra size  this top was too tight across my chest but billowed out in the back. its as if the armholes were too far forward. it is fairly short but i am short waisted. i really wanted this top to work but i had to return it. if i went up one size the back of the blouse would have been ridiculously large and the top was too e
-1,"This is a beautiful spring/summer dress  and the quality of the materials is great. i wanted to love it. but the sizing is ridiculous! i'm 5'3"" and 115 and i think you could fit three of me comfortably in the xs. while the pictures of the model in the dress don't suggest it has a shapeless cut  it definitely looked like a sack on me. a sack with a lovely print  but still an ill-fitting sack."
-1,"I wanted to love these jeans  but as a woman who is almost 45 there was way too much stretch in them. i am always a size 26 and i couldn't wear these  they were way too tight! they went back the next day. i will say  it could be my body type  i""m a runner so my legs are muscular. if you have very thin legs  these could be great and work for you. i loved the color  dark blue."
1,I recently bought this blouse  the soft fabric drapes nicely and the stitching is wonderful. love it!
1,Okay  so in terms of quality  i'm not sure these are really worth the price given i paid $18 for similar pants at a cheap 'teeny-bop' store  but i do love them. the legs are much wider than they look on the model but the shirring at the waist and the inverted tucks below the shirring make them hugely figure flattering. i found that they did run a little large but couldn't size down so i hope they don't stretch out. (bought xs  5'7  115lbs) the shirred waistband is a little loose but i like how t
0,"I'll start by saying that i loved this dress. i tried it on in the dressing room and knew i had to have it. the colors and design are beautiful and the fabric is soft. i did have to size up but it fit me perfectly once i did. i'm 5'1"" 130 lbs 34 d size 6 fit great.   the first time i pulled it out at home  i was gently pulling up the zipper and once it hits those ribbon areas on the side  the zipper seam split. i tried for a half hour to get it to realign. i finally decided to go exchange it for"
-1,Like the other reviewer said this top is extremely wide and boxy. it must be pinned in the picture online. it's very frustrating when they do that. thank goodness i didn't pay for shipping! for reference  i'm 5'2 and 135 pounds and bought the xxs  it's going back for sure. i'm trying to lose baby weight  not trying to look pregnant!
-1,"Great hopes but a sorry disappointment. at this price  one should be able to expect better pattern alignment as shown on model. the pattern in the garment i received was poorly matched on either side of the button placket. i am 5'6"" and ordered xxs. garment was significantly over-sized. i would have had to order one and probably two sizes smaller to achieve a decent fit. because of the oversizing  the shape is more boxy than it appears in the catalog photo. sadly  this buttondown has to be retur"
0,I bought 3 of these tops in different colors  the blue one had one sleeve noticeably shorter. sent it back. now less than 10 days later they are on sale. the style is darling and get many complements on the two i have. fyi i'm a 36d 130lbs and med fit great
0,I was in love with the green print  so i ordered this despite the reviews. i wish i'd listened. the fit is incredibly weird--huge at the top but tapering in at the hips. so sad this didn't work.
-1,Loved this dress online  but my small pettie stature made me looks like an orphan from the prairie.
1,"I actually like this better on the instagram picture than on the model... anyway  i ordered the xs petite (for 115 lbs  5'1.5"") and it fits really nicely. not too short. the material is nice and soft  nad looks like it may not wrinkles  which would be a bonus... the little gold buttons are super cute  but you can't really wear this untied  so it is pretty much a strictly tied short. sleeves are flattering... i think i may keep it :-)"
0,I looked like i was going to work on a farm. well made  but seemed fit big. i like and have owned wide leg pants/capris  these were cartoonishly wide.  needless to say  they were returned.
1,This hoodie is just what i had hoped it would be...it is super soft  comfortably loose  but with the tie bottom hugging the hips and low v-neck - it's just the right amount of sexy. it will be my go-to this fall and winter!
-1,"I ordered these pants after seeing the good reviews  but i don't agree. these are going back. i ordered a small. i'm 5'5"" and 135 pounds. i am usually between a small and a medium in pants  but the small in these pants is huge. i could definitely fit into an xs. but i also don't think they are very flattering and don't like the feel of the fabric. it's too bad. i love the idea of these."
0,I bought this a few weeks back. when i saw it (the blue one) in the store i touched it and it was extremely soft and even plush like. i tried it on and found it odd that this cloth and stone garment  like other viewers stated fit my bust and hips  typically they don't. i love the side buttons. i wear mine opened half way. my only complaint is i've washed it like the instructions state and my blouse is no longer as soft as it was before  and it needs to be ironed as it wrinkles easily. i still li
-1,The quality and fabric of this dress are lovely  but unfortunately i found it to be very unflattering and shapeless. it fit me like a sack  i ordered the m and i suppose i should've sized down  but even in the s i'm afraid this would be far too large. for reference  i am 5'7 and 135 lbs. i have a curvy build so this shape dress just wasn't right on me. i imagine it will look cute on more of a boyish figure. returned.
0,This dress is really attractive in terms of the pattern and the neckline. but the dealbreaker for me was the lack of darts in the back hip area--so that the stretch fabric really hugs the full curve of your booty. a size larger gave me bagginess in the top and a still snug fit in back that i just didn't feel comfortable about. some darts could have made a nicer fit here. but this is a a great dress if you don't mind a super body con fit.
-1,I though this dress would be similar to the turtleneck swing dress by maeve. it's not. first of all  it runs very large. i purchased a small (i am usually a xs or small in maeve  i purchased a small in the turtleneck swing dress). the shoulders were very wide  you had to manually cross the fabric around your neck but it didn't lay as flat as what i wanted around my chest  and it was quite large around my rib cage and stomach making it rather shapeless. i really wanted this dress to work (i love
0,I'm 5'6''   athletic build-thought it was cute but in the end didn't like the color of the inner sweatshirt--wish it was black or white. send it back.
-1,I was really excited to get this dress  i initially ordered a small (i am a size 4) but when i tried it on  it was really tight. the bodice at the top fit strangely-i had to shorten the straps quite a bit  and the dress just looked off. i love retailer and get all of my dresses from there  and the look of the dress on line was beautiful  but just didn't fit right. i did love the lace look  and would love seeing more dresses with this design.
1,Love the way these pants look in the pictures  great quality  but the style isn't really me. i gave it a try  so that's what counts!
0,"I tried this on in the store as soon as i saw it because of it's ease  modern look  and my obsession with stripes and wrap skirts. i am between an 8 and 10 in retailer most of the time (although sizing has been quite erratic in the last couple of years)  but picked up a 10 to ensure an easy fit. was so surprised to find you have to not only buckle (cute detail) but button and zip this ""easy"" skirt  and with all that there were also straps that buttoned that i believe are there to keep it from flyi"
-1,So disappointed. bought these in a 29 and should've gone with a 28. they're super cute - i got the green. the fit is off. like the other reviews  they stretch out way too much. i would return these but have already washed them. they wash terribly  too. there are weird fading marks all over  even when washed in cold water like the tag states. so disappointed that i spent my gift card from christmas on these. i've been a loyal retailer customer for years and this is the first time i've been severely
1,A fun  casual romper. i loved the pink color (not usually my thing)  which looks great with darker skin. like another reviewer said  the waist is quite small so i would recommend sizing up one or two sizes (i took a size 6 in this  but am usually a 2/4) - this will make the top part a bit blousy  but i think that adds to the appeal/ look.
0,Usually i am a huge meadow rue fan  but not this time. the print is okay  but the shirt seemed stiff and the material was not soft. if the print was just okay but the shirt was super soft or vice versa i would have probably kept the shirt  but since it was neither it was returned?
-1,This top looked super cute online but when it came it was super short and boxy. looked like a tent on me. this one went back the same day it came!
-1,The fabric of this vest is identical to a old white dish cloth! the cut of this vest is also bad! will be sent back!
-1,"The material is horrible  it's heavy and cheap. the skirt does not ""flow"" as it appears in the photo. instead the bottom part of the skirt just stands out like ruffles. am returning."
-1,"I purchase this top of ""what i thought to be a beautiful denim tunic/top"" in a small on the sale rack with additional promo with beautiful details   but what is going on with the mid-section where there is at least 6 inches of space where there is no button or way to close the lower placket! and the lower bottom of placket is sewn shut so it makes the mid section bubble out  but why no buttons to close what would be a button down top???? you can slide your hand through this open space and it ope"
0,Not flattering if your have large top. made well and very cute for thin no boob person
-1,"This arrived this week and i was so disappointed. the proportions are all wrong--- from the empire waist to the dolman sleeves  to the weird texture added to the material. if i could sum up this jacket with one word it would be ""weird""."
1,First time trying pilcro  but glad i did. these shorts are extremely soft and comfortable without being too short. love love!
-1,Wasn't crazy about this top. it looked great online but in person it's just a boring and lifeless top.
1,I like that you can dress this shirt up or down. go out  or lounge in it! very comfortable and i would recommend buying it.
-1,Quality was not what you expect from retailer  especially for the price. top is lined but skirt is not. material is tissue paper thin and see thru. there is a point at the bottom of the sweetheart neckline that does not lay flat  it keeps popping up. however the back is very cute and for that i wanted to love it but too many negatives. was returned.
0,This shirt is beautiful  however i thought that it was made of a softer  lighter material. it is  instead  made of a thick  heavy material that was unflattering for my shape. ( short torso ann's large bust) it made me look boxy and chunky in the middle. sadly  i'll be returning it.
1,This is one of the most comfortable swimsuits i own. i purchased it in the turquoise dots print and found that it was colorful and perfect for a beach getaway. the adjustable halter style makes it really comfortable  yet cute. i highly recommend this suit to those looking for a unique  yet whimsical swimsuit style.
0,Although the fabric and color is beautiful   the sleeves do not lay properly. they are too stiff and look like wings on me. sadly i must return. the quality looks great. it is unfortunate that the design was a miss.
0,Looks so beautiful.... on a hanger. does not really do anything on a person. beautiful beading but the dress on is very sack-like. i will be returning it
0,It is very sheer which is too bad because the design is super cute.
1,It is easily paired with a nice tip for work and feels great to wear all day
1,The red detail at the shoulders is pretty  and i liked the contrast between the red and white. the fabric is soft and comfortable. it is a sweater knit fabric  more substantial than you might guess from photos. the sleeve ruffles were a little poofy for me  and combined with the loose fit it made me feel a little too girl-ish. this could work for you if you are looking for a peasant style blouse with a forgiving shape and nice details  but it wasn't quite right for me.
1,"This dress is extremely flattering on and looks a lot better when worn than on the hanger. the cut drapes very nicely and is true to size. i am 5 feet tall / 95lbs and the xxsp fit perfectly. it is a bit short however  so i would caution that it may not be work ""office"" appropriate if you are taller. like most hd in paris dresses  it is also quite thin although lined. this dress would look lovely with a either delicate jewelry or a bold statement piece and is casual enough for a lunch outing or"
0,"This top hit at my hips not as it appears on the model in the photo  and i am short at 5' 2"". cute top  but shorter than i had expected and definitely not a tunic style."
1,This dress has a really lovely design and is very  very comfortable. it is not quite as flattering as i had hoped  and doesn't have quite as defined a shape as i expected. still  it's cute and i'm happy to have it!
0,I tried this on in the store and decided to order a larger size online. the fabric by the buttons is very thin so any pulling will cause tears the one i tried on in store was shredded by someone else trying it. i'm a 34 dd and bought a 14. before trying it on i noticed the fabric is already pulling a little right out of the package. trying to decide if it is worth keeping or will be destroyed from wearing.   it really is very cute on.
0,I have more of an athletic figure  and the sleeves tend to come in closer to the body than pictured. i didn't like that cut on my arms/torso. the shirt is really cute  otherwise! i am usually a size 4/small and this was a little short and snug.
1,This is a beautiful piece that can be paired with multiple ways.. the color is rich and classy
-1,The fun colors drew me to this but it sure fit weird. the top was fine but it became a bit tent-like in the waist. the material doesn't feel great either.
-1,I wanted to like this and even considered getting it altered  but just decided to return. it runs big and from the front it looks good  but the back just looked like a big oversized  stretched out tank. it was so comfy on though and not sheer or revealing. so if you're tall  go for it!!
1,This is very cute. i got a lot of compliments when i wore it. i'm 5'10 so i always struggle with tops being too short but this was ok
0,When i first saw this shirt online i was so excited! it reminded me of why i love shopping in the fall! unfortunately when it came i was so disappointed. in person the fabric and the colors are gorgeous. it's fairly lightweight for a flannel but so soft and comfy cozy. i love the navy/cream polka dot that is on the inside of the cuffs and collar as well  and the buttons are cute too! when i put it on it was so comfortable  but it made me look like i was pregnant! especially from the side it just
1,It's too hot here in ca to wear this yet but i can't wait for cooler weather. i tried it on with skinny jeans and it's darling. love how it's much shorter in front with the side splits and long back to cover the bum. perfect for leggings. nice slim  but not tight fit.
-1,I wanted to love this shirt so much! i got this as a gift for christmas in the black. the first time i wore the shirt 3 of the buttons on the back fell off. keep in mind that they are not decorative and they held the shirt together. needless to say i was not so pleased to have my shirt fly open from the back. retailer and their amazing customer service took this shirt back no problem  but i wanted to give the fair warning!
0,"I bought three of these tees. i kept the turquoise one only though. the color was pretty - a little drab but not too bad.      i love the style.  the fabric is so soft and the one i wore was super comfy. the sleeves are cute without being too dramatic (like the ruffle sleeve tee - the sleeves were kind of ridiculous on me)     now - the cons - the colors are pretty drab. i normally look better in more vibrant colors. the ""red"" i bought made me look like a corpse. it's not pretty at all. can't re"
-1,It's not a bad concept but i wished for more. i wish this tunic was a: different material as it was wrinkley and drop-waist design instead of at the waist. too bad. i wanted to love it but it will go back.
1,Fits great and goes great under cardigans and jackets
1,Fits true to size and rides the line between contemporary and retro exceptionally well.
1,"I tried it on and it fit like a glove. i'm only 5'2"" and i can wear with heals or flats. great built in bra. i'm a c cup and i've got a bubble butt. very flattering on my figure. quality worth every penny. many compliments. work appropriate or a luncheon! my fav retailer purchase by far."
0,Gosh this is beautiful but it is way wider and puffer than i imagined it would be. in fact it almost looks like a costume or something you would buy handmade. i would just feel silly wearing this out to dinner with a group of friends. i gave it high ratings on the quality however because it really is beautiful but the design is just not what i had hoped for.
0,I have been eyeing this piece for months now! i broke down and bought it when they finally had my size in stock. i am 5 '4 and 110 lbs and have a very small chest so i ordered an xs. i think the top is too baggy for me. yes  the top and bottoms fit overall  but it doesn't look as nice and form fitting like it does on the model. it is very sheer--which is the thing that discourages me the most. i love the concept of this piece but the execution could use some work  which i am willing to work on s
0,I love the wide straps but it runs small and is short. still great for layering. great  soft material. i hate that it is so tight and short but if i size up them the arm holes would be way too big.
1,This jacket looked so good and felt so comfortable on- i almost didn't send back the first one that arrived with a little bit of damage at the bottom of the inner zippered sweatshirt  but i did exchange it and am just as happy with the fit and feel of the second one. it hangs well no matter how you fasten the front  or leave it open. great looking  casual but stylish and neat. a good grey  and a good blue.
-1,This is a beautiful dress but unfortunately it is only for women who are not well endowed - it is extremely well fitted in the chest. the high waste also poufs out due to a lot of extra material and the double lining. a beautiful dress but a very very poor construction. also there are bright blue and yellow beads in the chest area that are a bizarre combo to the corals and browns of the fabric. i am normally a 4/6 at retailer and the 8 was extremely small.
-1,"I have been looking for a nice  white tunic and i should have known when i saw this was one size fits all. maybe because i am petite (5'2"") but there was so much material hanging everywhere that it made me look even shorter and fat. who wants that? so sending it back."
1,The size s arm holes are a little too over-sized and i find i keep adjusting the shoulders so the sides of my bra won't show (and sizing down to an xs made the body too tight). it's a bit pricey for a basic  thin tank  but it's a good every day  wear all the time staple.
1,I just received this in the mail and i was so surprised how flattering it is!  i ordered the print and i can see wearing this to work  out with friends or for date night!  perfect summer tank!  comfortable and flattering!  a great addition to my wardrobe! it fit true to size for me!
0,I love maeve dresses but there are several issues with this one (for my taste). 1) the fabric and color closely resembles my medical scrubs  2) the zipper is cheap and barely goes up or down  even when it's just on the hanger. 3) the bow is really cute but doesn't make up for the other shortcomings.
1,Ordered two of these and they fit great and will be perfect for layering.  true to size fit.  cute detail in the back for a racer tank!
1,Soft fabric  waistband is flat no vpl!lace trim cuts in a bit for a little vpl- but still nice lightweight  barely there but full coverage. would buy again!
-1,I ordered a med petite. usually this fits but this shirt was long and the sleeves wouldnt stay down. as a regular shirt it was not cute.
-1,Love retailer's kimonos and when i saw this pattern i had to have it! unfortunately  when i bought it the tag was already showing holes so they gave me 15% off... went to wear it for the first time  there was already a huge snag in it! i love retailer but for 98$ this is not worth your money.
-1,I wanted to like this top  especially because of its comfortable material and color  but the asymmetrical shape didn't hang well on me. it also runs big - i got a small  and although the bodice fit okay  the sleeves were long  and the bottom of the top looked mishaped and dumpy. this top will be going back.
1,I ordered christmas presents online this year. they arrived very quickly and were well received! they are ferry pretty!!! i will order online again!!!
1,This piece is very comfortable and feels well made. it is not slimming.
1,Found this jumpsuit in standard size small/red motif (pictures don't do it justice) in-store and to my surprise  it actually fit! of course  it was billowy since i'm short/ 113lbs.  and it came all the way down to the bottom of my ankles where they meet my feet  which i don't mind. i love that it almost looks like a maxi dress when on. the smocked bodice was snug for a size small so there is a little bit of skin bubbling out in the chest area/near my armpits..like normal women usually have. ladi
-1,I wanted to love this shirt  but was very disappointed. i had read other reviews and still ordered  but wish i would have listened. the shirt looks nothing like photos online and is extremely boxy and unflattering. had to send it back.
-1,I just got this and couldn't wait to wear it to work today. it is such a pretty designed top. unfortunately  it is falling apart as i write this review. one sleeve is unraveling. there are strings hanging off all over the lacy arms. am so disappointed in the quality. i'll be sending it back when i get home.
0,It's a beautiful top  but not for the price. very thin material (not see-through though)  i fear it may easily rip.
0,I so loved the look of this top and most of the reviews seemed really good. i thought the material was great and i ordered the blue which is a beautiful color....but......the fit was way off and the design is way off for a girl with hips. first the fit  the arm pits are low and don't actually tuck into where your armpits are  so you have this weird restriction in arm movement. then the design is not great either (and others mentioned this)  the sweater at the bottom has way too much extra materi
-1,I have been continually disappointed in retailer's clothing for the past year. i feel like their prices have soared and the quality has remained so-so  but dresses like these somehow make the cut. it does not make sense. since when did retailer exclusively market to older women? no  retailer's market has always been young adults. this dress is extremely matronly. although the bottom print is nice  the hot pink belt?? is completely mismatched and gaudy. i really hope retailer starts curating better dress
1,This dress is gorgeous! i sized up from my usual 6 to an 8  cause i'm not much for form fitted dresses. however  it was still pretty body con for me. i passed in it for now  but in the future i might try a 10 petite?? the color is a nice brick red with a textured whitish pattern. and it is soft ... like i wanted to snuggle up on the couch in it  but i had to refrain! i've been having bad luck with zippers from retailer dresses recently  but this one was smooth sailing and pretty too! the length wa
-1,Hahaha..this dress is hilarious! it looks nothing like the image! i am usually a 0/xs  and 4 was the smallest size available  so i ordered it. when i opened it  it felt like 10 lbs of fabric. i thought maybe i ordered a size way too big  until i could barely squeeze into the top of the dress. once i looked in the mirror  i almost fell over laughing. the rest of the dress is huge. i don't believe this dress would be flattering on anyone.
1,The retailer store by me only carried these in the petites  but i've learned to always snag a petite just to see because sometimes the petites fit just as well  if not better  depending on the length of the outfit!  ______________  pros:  - looks exactly the same in person as online. color runs true.  - well made  good stitching  solid dress.  - great length in the sleeves.  - fits tts. i'm normally a size 10 or 12 and grabbed the 12p to see how it'd fit. other than being too short in length on my
-1,"1.) if you look at the 4th photo of the grey shirt and zoom in you can get an accurate view of the back: this shirt is attached in not one  but two places in the back (in the photos of the black shirt it looks like it is only attached  or ""knotted"" in one place  and that is not the case). disappointing.   ----------  2.) unless you want to wear this as an off-the-shoulder shirt with a strapless bra size down. caveat: sizing down will become problematic though for those with large arms as the sle"
0,I bought this dress to attend a couple of summer weddings. it seemed like it would be a nice  light summer dress that i could wear all day. i do think it fits that qualification  however  it wasn't as flattering as i hoped. i'm generally pear shaped - small waist  larger hips. this dress does fit well over my hips  but does very little to show off my waist. overall  it is just ok.
-1,I really wanted to love this cardigan and did until i tried it on. the arms are so tight! i ordered in a m  which is my normal retailer size  but couldn't move my arms. took it back  was going to try in a l  but store didn't have any. for the price  i need to be able to move my arms!
0,The fringe and fit were beautiful  but the lace with it (a little hard to see in the photo) seemed like an odd pairing -- just too much going on. returning . . . .
-1,I wanted to like this top so so so so badly. so badly in fact  that after the first size didn't fit  i ordered two other sizes to make sure: xl  l  m. none of them worked i really wanted to like this top. the online photo makes the clothing look so flattering and the shirt is just not....at least on me. the shirt online on the model looks slimming and a lot longer than the actual piece of the clothing. the beaded work is very beautiful  but short causing the very poofy peplum to start at the mos
0,I live in ny and bought his coat for the winter  thinking since it was made out of wool it would be warm. this coat is extremely thing  more like a spring/fall coat and therefore i don't think the price justifies the quality. i am going to return and consider repurchasing if it goes on sale. i also wish it had a button or way of keeping it closed rather than just hang loosely.
-1,This top fit perfectly but too much of my bra was showing through the black lace. it would be a great top to use as loungewear  though.
1,"This one is perfect for the taller ladies (or those looking for a longer fit). i was a little discouraged by a few short-fitting tops recently  and this one finally works for me (at 5'7"" with a long torso). awesome quality  not overly delicate  and beautiful detail."
0,The quality of the fabric is soft and thick and well made. loved everything about it but if you are ample in the chest  it is snug and does not hang and drape as well like on the model  so you may want to size up. i am sending it back as the fit is not flattering on me for the price. someone with a boyish no-curve figure would look dynamite in it!
0,I definitely like unique things  but the sleeves are way too much on this sweater.  it's a shame because it is so soft and comfortable  but overall i felt it looked somewhat silly on me.
0,"I tried this on in the store and the colors and fabric are terrific. it's very light-weight fabric but isn't see-through. the colors are medium in depth  not too bright. if you typically wear ""cool"" colors and avoid browns  you may be able to wear this because the brown is very muted. there's two strings inside that you tie around your waist to pull the bust of the dress in. i'm 5'4"" and 125 lbs  so there's simply too much fabric in the dress. i would have bought a petite. the tag says it's avai"
0,Overall nice material and styling but be prepare for it to be huge. i purposely sized down and i still felt like i was swimming in this.
-1,I don't typically write bad reviews  but this dress is so bad and i want to save someone else from buying it. i read the mostly bad reviews and still purchased anyway (my fault i know). the dress is super stiff ( i know denim can be that way and it is possible it would soften up after a few washes). i'm typically a 6/8 and the size small swallowed me  and the xs was big everywhere except through the bust (i ordered both sizes to try). i wouldn't recommend buying this if you are a size 8 or small
-1,I was very excited about this dress having seen someone where it on the street months ago. i got my usual size 6 and could not button it up for the life of me. i get it  i'm busty and sometimes button downs are a tricky. however  the arms were impossibly tight. my boyfriend starting cracking up when he saw my arms busting out of the sleeves.
0,"Just didnt like the fit. it ""puffed out"" in front  so that wasnt very flattering. i have an hourglass shape  and this was not a good fit for me."
-1,"I wanted to love this coat so bad. the material is lovely and it's beautiful on the hanger but being tall and skinny is a must to pull it off. if you have any hips forget it (my hips are 38"")- you end up looking incredibly bottom heavy. the jacket also ran funny across the shoulders....like the underarm was sewn low down the arm so arm movement was restricted  it was weird. but it buttoned nicely without any pulling so it wasn't a size thing. i bought a size medium  at 5'5"" and 140 pounds."
0,This is a comfortable sweater dress  and the quality of the material seems good. the solid blue strip down the front makes it look very bland. i think it would need some dressing up with a necklace or scarf. i decided to pass.
-1,I thought the dress was ok  but was surprised by the cut away triangles of material right under bra band on the sides of dress. i will send back  also a bit too high waisted for me. other than that  the dress is as it appears.
1,I definitely agree with the other reviewers who said this top is better suited for someone tall and slender. the design on the lace is beautiful and i love the scalloped hem. but it is somewhat boxy and flowy  which didn't seem to work on my curvy body proportion-wise.
-1,"Ordered online  and when it came i was very excited to open it - but the photo doesn't show how incredibly wide the cut is. it is also quite cropped and looked very awkward on me - 5'9  130. the embroidery is lovely  but the style doesn't work. i had a small  but the area in the shoulders was cut very tight and it would not have worked well if i wanted to raise or lower my arms above shoulder height. might work better on someone with a more petite frame  but i do caution how ""voluminous"" the cut"
1,"I adore the tiny brand blouses! this one is lovely  and i feel new and beautiful in the navy with the sheer sleeves and bumpy  embroidered material  very pretty indeed. this probably is equally stunning in the nude color  but it doesn't show well somehow online. the navy is certainly amazing  and i was so proud to wear this blouse today for work with jeans. i always find the tiny sizing to be one size off. the large fits me perfectly  although i am a medium in most all other tops. 5.1""  130 #  3"
-1,Really wanted to like this and took chances based on other reviews  even with the sale price and addtl discount. it's basically $30 blouse fabric with design and detail-work of a much more expensive blouse. the white is sheer and and fabric will wrinkle easily. if it were black  you could probably get away with it  but the white shows too many flaws and will wrinkle. sad to have to send it back.
0,So  this is a super soft comfy sweater. the color is great and i really wanted to love it. but the dolman sleeves sort of annoyed me. that being said  all of the good things about this sweater almost made me keep it. the neckline is also really neat. it drapes nicely  and stays that way. if you are on the fence give it a try!
1,First mermaid-ish skirt ever that's flattering enough to pull off with a curvy lower body. the material is light-weight sweater knit that hugs in all the right places and its unique cut along the bottom make it very in the moment. the color is a rich  deep  gorgeous brown with subtle highlights that draw from whatever top you pear with it. runs large so size down.
0,I ordered this dress in my usual size and unfortunately when it arrived  it was damaged and also a little too big. the fabric had lots of pulls in it like it had been tried on many times.  i called customer service and requested a replacement in a smaller size. it fit great and looked beautiful but there was a rip in the sleeve.  this is a gorgeous dress and very flattering and well fitting (if you size down)  but i had to return both and wear something else to a holiday party.  i'd only recomme
0,"I expected to love this  since i usually look good in this style of jacket. it's definitely comfortable and the fit was fine  but i really don't care for the wooden buttons and the overall look was just ""meh."" it's going back  unfortunately."
-1,First of all  this is not pullover styling. there is a side zipper. i wouldn't have purchased it if i knew there was a side zipper because i have a large bust and side zippers are next to impossible for me.  second of all  the tulle feels and looks cheap and the slip has an awkward tight shape underneath.  not at all what is looks like or is described as. sadly will be returning  but i'm sure i will find something to exchange it for!
-1,Wanted to like this type. cute print. something about the width and length of this top didn't work on me. was a little boxy. i'm 5'4  135lbs  size xs-s. might be cuter on different body type  i'm hourglass and athletic.
1,I did not try this on alone but rather with a long sleeve white tee and white button down shirt. i really liked both looks. if i find it to be itchy like the other review i will have to return. this is an effortless fashion statement yet it could easily be a weekender cozy staple. my only complaint is why two neutral colors? this would have been great if offered in a richer darker yarn. the two offered colors are so similar and both looked drab against my skin tone.
-1,"These socks were so narrow  especially on top  that they pinched my thighs and we're almost painful to wear all day. my thighs are pretty narrow  i'm only five feet tall and my legs and hips are the thinnest part of my body. i understand that they need to be reinforced on top so that they don't slip down but these are definitely made for a person who is unhealthily skinny. ""one size"" is definitely not true. they also snag easily."
0,I kept this top  only because i needed a plain black tank  but there is nothing special about it. i found it a bit large and thin cheap material.
1,I agree the pictures are confusing. the front top of the dress is not cut out as some pictures seem to indicate. this is such a great dress! it has a great lining underneath and is really flattering and nicer/dressier looking in person than i imagined it would be. i think it fits true to size. i either wear a 4 or a 6 in most retailer dresses and the 4 in this dress fits me well. i'm planning to wear this dress to my bridesmaids luncheon! i definitely recommend!
0,I am sure these pants are right for someone  just not me. i am wider in the hips  and they just were really unflatering. the fabric is very lightweight  which i wasn't expecting  and so while the pleats are interesting  with my hips they ended up hitting in just the wrong place. the waist was also much lower than i expected -- not low rise  but i'm used to thinking high waist with wide legs. in short  these pants are probably great on some body types  just not mine. also very long. i'm 5-8 and a
0,I really wanted to love this romper and couldn't wait to try it on.   it's super cute and love the material but once on the top portion is way too baggy even after cinching the waist.   if i pulled the waist all the way down it looks smoother and nice   but if it sits at my natural waist   the back balloons out and it's unflattering.  it's too bad   i love the print and ease of this design.
-1,I saw tons of people raving about this piece so i had to check it out for myself. i love the vibrant colors and the design and while the fabric is delicate it feels amazing and light. i sadly had to leave it as the store as i am a girl with a larger chest and big hips. i looked huge and it was not flattering to my shape. if this dress came in a maxi with a high waist like i would be all over it. it is beautiful.
-1,This blouse has too much drapey fabric and it's just not flattering.  in the front part of the blouse the fabric is relatively short  but the sleeves have so much excess fabric it almost looks like a clown suit.  sending back.
0,I really wanted this jumpsuit to be my holiday staple! i ordered this jumpsuit in a sz 4 (my typical size) - the jumpsuit doesn't have a waist  i suppose the ribbon created the illusion of a waist. most jumpsuits are super slimming because of having a waistband and this does not besides the bow. also what i found strange is the back zipper goes all the way down passed your bottom - it's the longest zipper i've ever seen. it's very body hugging so it shows your curves if you have any. i will sadl
-1,The fabric is great. the design is fun. i thought the dress would be perfect for work and also wear for a fun night out. the fit was perfect up top but the bottom part was to full and a lot longer then i expected. so i had to return it.
1,Love the sleeves - good length and fit. it's a basic tee that has added flare.
1,This is such a pretty top.  i love the mix of patterns. the colors are beautiful!  it really looks great on.  the peplum is very minimal in this top.  the entire top itself is somewhat oversized  but in a pretty way.  i bought this in a large and probably could have gone with a medium  but didn't want the length to be any shorter  so i'm sticking with the large.  for reference   i'm 6ft and 175lbs.  i usually wear a size 10/12 or medium/large.  also  i didn't notice a puckering between the two m
-1,"I ordered this dress in a xs petite. i am 5'0"" 105 lbs. the plaid looks more drab in person and the fit was very frumpy. the wrap style is typically flattering but on this dress  the dress tied above my natural waist and the fit made my hips appear larger. i was pretty disappointed in this little number and will be sending it back. it might work on taller people  like the model  but i would steer clear if you are a petite."
0,I loved this dress the minute i tried it on and am actually really sad that i had to return it. however  the embroidery was unraveling in several places before i'd even worn it  so i thought it would probably only get worse. too bad because it's gorgeous and flattering!
0,It reminds me of maternity clothes. soft  stretchy  shiny material. cut is flattering and drapes nicely. i only found one button to close front... looked awkward. nice long sleeves. not for me but maybe for others. just ok.
1,I am a huge fan of absolutely everything tanvi kedia designs. her clothing is intricate  boho  colorful and fits like a dream. when i saw this online i had to have it. it just arrived today and its everything i imagined it to be! the fit is more like the studio pics and less like the first catalog pic. the dress definitely has some room  but it isn't quite as swingy as the catalog photo. i have a lot of curves  so it may be swingy on a more slender figure. i ordered an xl mostly because of the s
1,I was looking for a lightweight top to wear with black linen trousers to a party  i was not sure of this top seeing it on a slender model (i am a more typical 50 year old mom body) and i have never worn a peplum style. i put it on for my husband and approved  so i wore it. i received many compliments - a few from good friends who congratulated me for going out of my 'comfort zone' with the style!
-1,"This dress is just too baggy overall. i am 5'6"" 140 lbs and a size small was so unflattering. i can't go down in size because the waist detail will get too high on me. it was already a little high on the small."
-1,I purchased the blue with white dots. the shape was awful  but looked like a sack - returned
-1,This is a beautiful kimono but just isn't made well. the one i received already had a couple small holes and a pull in the thread that was very noticeable. after reading the additional reviewer who wore it an hour and it was already pilling  it is going back for good. such a shame!
1,This shirt feels amazing. it also drapes nicely and is very feminine and flattering. great versatile piece.
1,I am pleased with this skirt. the jean material is of good quality and it hangs right on my waist and hips. i ordered a 2 which left a little room in the waist to tuck in a blouse. i am 5/5 and 119. it works well for work and leisure.
-1,I found the fit of this dress odd. i typically wear a 6 or 8 in dresses. the 6 fit across the chest but the armholes were large so wearing a bra would be a challenge. i am a 34c so i need some type of support. i also thought the fabric was a bit flimsy for the price. i am a huge retailer fan and usually leave glowing reviews but sadly i left this one in the store.
1,"Since several reviews said that this dress ran small online  i decided to go to my local retailer store to try this on in person. i am 5""6""  120 lbs. and normally a 0 or 2. the 2 worked perfectly. i loved the red version online but thought the green was better for me in person (the red is a tomato red and was more overpowering on my fair skin). the green also has light blue in the detail print so maybe good if you have blue eyes. no problems with the zippers on the ones i tried at the store."
-1,Seems there was a design defect in this item--sleeves are way too tight and hardly go on without ripping the shirt. i have pretty thin arms so it's hard to imagine this not happening on anyone. too bad because it's otherwise a very nice top.
0,It's rare for a dress to completely not work on me  but this dress completely did not work on me. i'm tall and have an hourglass figure. i got this dress in my usual size s. this dress somehow made me look ridiculously pear shaped. the empire type bust of the dress made both my bust (32c) and my waist look pretty much non-existent. it looked so bad on me i actually laughed. it's a shame though  because i had been eyeing this dress for a long time. and it is a beautiful dress  but i would not rec
1,This dress intrigued me a bit online  but not enough to order it to try it. even on the rack  i wasn't so sure about it  but decided to try it this afternoon. i couldn't have been more pleased. it is fresh  flattering  flowy  light and beautiful. even though there is quite a bit of fabric  the vertical stripes and nipped in waist make it extremely flattering. i didn't realize this came in blue as well. i may add that one to my wishlist  but the red one is a definite winner. it will make a great
0,I love how different this dress is in terms of the design. it catches light beautifully. the short  biased hem makes the dress fun and flirty. but  this dress is completely sheer. there is no lining which is very disappointing. i do have a short  nude slip that makes this dress work for me. you will need a slip  for sure! unless you are rhianna. the sizing runs a little large  i probably could size down given the loose cut but overall the proportions are flattering showing off my legs. i will re
-1,This shirt runs gigantic and it's not even cute. i.'m done buying retailer online.
-1,Material is strange. triangle top is funky. this is just not awesome in any way.
1,I bought this dress for summer celebrations. the fabric is beautiful and the colors are soft and enhance the flow of the dress. the fit is true to size and i especially like that it is not too low cut in the front. i will pair it with a light sweater or denim jacket. definitely a dress than can be dressed up or down. very feminine and has a romantic feel.
0,This top is very nice. i ordered it in black  it looked very good. the embroidery and pleated details give it a very nice look. the fabric  however  feels like heavy cotton. it didn't feel very soft and comfortable  it was a bit hard for me to wear because i usually prefer soft cotton. while i think this will retain it's shape and not stretch like softer cotton  i am sending it back. it felt a bit heavy to wear.
1,I bought this dress to wear to a pre-wedding event at an out of country beach wedding in late fall  so i bought it a size smaller than normal  but it fits  so i could say it runs a little big. very cute though and i thought even more flattering than i thought it would be from the picture! i'm more top heavy  and it kind of camouflaged that  which is always great!
-1,I splurged on this top and was sadly disappointed. i'm a 36d  and the l was so tight i couldn't get it over my chest. also the arms were super tight and the length is nearly cropped.  and the fabric is shiny  the picture makes it look like it's matte. if it did fit like the model i would've loved it. the print is beautiful though. bummer
-1,1. this looks so cute on the model  doesn't it? i have no idea where you wear a suit with hot pants  but it looks cute.  2. that said  keep in mind the model is probably 6 feet 10 inches tall. i'm 5 feet 6 inches tall  and this jacket came down to my knees. i'm not kidding. the 3/4 length sleeves were at my wrist  so more like 7/8 sleeves.  3. i'm normally a size 12 in cartonnier jackets  but this only comes s  m or l. the medium is really a size 10  which was too tight across the shoulders and

-1,"Finally received this in the mail today and was very disappointed. i am swimming in the xs (5'4""  110lbs). the colors are much more vibrant that shown in the pics - the green is a bright kelly green  the red is much more red than rust colored  etc. and it's a sweater coat! for the price i was expecting it to be lined and higher quality. i don't doubt that it will be warm  but can't justify the price. it's going back to the store."
1,I love this dress so much. absolutely beautiful true to the size. since i start wearing it i got so many good compliment. the flowers is very spring and summary. very sexy to the bottom....
0,I am undecided if i will keep this dress or not. i am 5/4  155 lbs and ordered both the small and medium. the medium was comically large on me  with broad shoulders and a sack-like appearance. but the small fit very well and felt very french girl chic. the brownish-greenish color is really stunning in person  like a greenish copper. and the gathered sleeves elevate this into a dressier look. but the material is sheer  so you would need to wear a slip  and the elastic waist still has somewhat of
1,I worry when i have an elastic waist  or something that resembles this  but the dress hangs like a dream. no puffing out  no gathers that you can see. it is not sheath  but not a line either  kind of in between  hits several inches above my knees  but perfect with some black tights for winter. i saw the note about grey  have to try it on agin in daylight  but i would say think black on the top  light camel color on the bottom i am 5'8  typically wear a size 12  and it was true to size for me the

0,There is simply a ton of fabric on this tee. i am a size 8 on top  with a fairly thin upper body but still an 8. at retailer i often order small for swingy tees  medium for more slim-cut. this tee in the small was huge. the shoulders fit well  but the body was so big and was a weirdly long length. just odd  especially for $78...

0,I absolutely love the look and fit of these jeans. i did have to size down. i ran into problems after washing. the fraying on one leg was twice that of the other  looking very unbalanced. after looking closely i found that one leg had a top stitching very close to the fray to prevent further fraying. the other leg did not have this stitching  thus the fraying double in size. i have sent a request to customer service for a replacement pair. these are adorable jeans just be sure to check for stitc
1,"This dress is still super cute despite its shortcomings. i agree with other reviewers that it definitely runs large  and very small petite/thinner ladies might feel it's overwhelming. it worked for me in my usual size l though. for reference i'm 5'3 and this hit just above the knee. and while the dress is ""roomy "" a smaller size would likely have been tighter or pulled on my fuller (36d) chest as there's not much give in that area. i agree that the armpit holes are ridiculous  but a thin camisol"
0,I really want to like this dress - it's beautiful  but it just fits like a sack. the yoke exaggerates my bust and the dress makes me look 20 lbs heavier. perhaps if you are tall and thin like the mode  or small chested  it would be great! the quality and color is beautiful.
1,"I agree with the other reviewer that the color isn't as pink in person and more subtle. my thoughts below on some other things:  __________  pros:  - pockets! makes it so fun and chic with the overall style.  - the material is lovely and breathable. i didn't find it sheer at all! of course  i didn't wear it outside the dressing room. the material is thicker but it hangs on the body well.  - runs ""mostly"" tts. i only tried on the medium and it fit everywhere being slightly tighter in the chest. i"
1,This is one of my favorite retailer dresses of all time. it is soo much better in person and on than the stock photos. very romantic and fun.
1,I loved this dress the second i saw it in the catalog and had to have it! i had been looking for a plaid dress for awhile but couldn't find anything that i fell in love with till this one. i love the front of the dress and the asymmetrical details. it's just beautiful. my only complaint would be that the back of the dress is pretty blah. after all the awesome going on in front  i was disappointed in the view from behind  but i still love this dress and will be keeping it and wearing it for a lon
-1,I purchased this in the yellow xs. it is very comfortable  but extremely see-through. you'd have to wear a slip or something underneath it  but i'm not sure what would work based on the style  and even if i wore a strapless bra it was still see-through. unfortunately i had to return it.
0,I like the look of this sweater and i am keeping it. however  i found the fit under the arms a little uncomfortable. there is a large seem that goes under the armpit and is a little bulky and irritating. also would not recommend if you are busty. because of how the stripes run  it looks stretched out over my chest.
1,"This is such a cute dress! the skirt is very full but does not add visual weight to those of us who already have enough actual weight. i ordered the black/beige print and the fabric is beautiful. it really drapes and hangs nicely. because there is so much fabric  i don't think this dress needs a lining. it seems to wash and hang dry well. i'm 5'4""  about 160 lbs. i like the way the medium fit. the length was slightly above the knee  which was ok with me (i'm nearly 60.) all in all  i can see mys"
-1,I wish i had read the other reviews before purchasing this product. label says that you can wash and dry normally. however  upon washing  the outer layer shrunk and the inner lining did not. the robe will now not lay flat; the fabric pulls at the edges  and results in the inner lining being revealed when the robe is tied shut. extremely disappointed. for a $100 garment  i expected much more. i wish i could return this.
0,I really liked this top when i saw it online. i went to the store to check the sizes. i am a small or a medium. i tried on the s and the xs. even the xs was huge. unfortunately the xxs is sold out. i don't understand the sizing on this at all. it's a shame because the top itself is very pretty. just be sure you try it on before purchasing.
0,Love the print  length  and cut. but the tie waist hangs in a weird way and seemed like it would stretch out and sag after a while. sad to return it.
-1,I liked this top okay but i did not think it was worth full price. i thought it was only average.
-1,I ordered this cardigan on sale and it was a wonderful fit and color. just the light sort of cute pullover i was looking for to keep and wear at work. unfortunately  it is poorly made. i wore it once and it already started to fray and fall apart. after closely inspecting the cause  i realized that the threads in the sweater are not fully sewed together  so the minute you put it on  one will start to unravel leading to a domino effect. it is a shame because the design and cut were truly a great f
0,These pants are cute. they seem  to me  to have a wider leg than appears on the model. they do run big  so i would recommend sizing down if in doubt. these are cute pants that can be dressed up or down  but unfortunately  look pretty sloppy by the end of the day  as they stretch and wrinkle very quickly. since they already run a bit big  this is a major negative. i wore them to church  and they were quite wrinkled by time i got home. by late afternoon  they looked like a different pair of pants.
0,I bought this because i loved it online but in person there is another level to the shirt that i did notice in another picture. i didn't like the second level on me since i am a shorter person. just didn't fit my body quite right.
0,Run large and leg is very wide. even sizing down  they seemed too floppy.
1,This shirt is so cute with skinny jeans and crossbody bag! i am 34b so i did not have the issue with the cut of top at the bustline. love it!
0,Love the top. love the color. love the back detail. as a larger chested woman  the shape was lost a bit. but i just couldn't resist.
0,I purchased this dress to wear to a beach wedding. i loved the color  the fit and the style. i even got a lot of compliments on it. the problem was that the wedding was on the beach  in florida 85 degree weather and when you are sweating the fabric changes colors and takes a really really long time to return to normal! unfortunately i had to return it. would be great to wear indoors  just watch getting water or anything else on it!
1,Beautiful cobalt blue dress. i wore it for christmas and had many compliments.
0,These are a wonderful trouser style pant. i love fitted than flared denim so this fit isn't my top pick but it's a cute style! thick quality denim fabric with a medium rise cut.
1,This is my new favorite top! looks and fits as described.
0,Online this dress looks so perfect  but in person it's a bit dowdy and unflattering  at least on me. i'm a size 4 with curves  and i was hoping it would enhance my waist and flatter my figure. but  sadly  it was too large on the waist and too poofy in the skirt  so it just did nothing for me. i considered sizing down to a 2 so that the waist would fit  but the skirt still has too much fabric  making my hips look large. so much potential  but missed the mark for me.
0,I was so excited to get this top..but it's boxy and a little itchy from the design. i just didn't think it was worth the hefty price. i'm normally a small in retailer clothing
-1,While this is cozy and well made  the problem lies with the unavoidable exposure of the inside of the poncho  which looks unfinished. had the inside been lined or had the hue of the stripes continued through the material  the draped look of this piece would be gorgeous. unfortunately  the faded backside of the pattern (a glimpse of it under model's left hand)  viewable through the very large arm holes (and impossible to hide)  disrupts the effortless  fluid feel that a poncho should have. i was
-1,Really like this dress but.....  the dress is lined in a heavy fabric and weighs a lot for a summer dress  worst of all there is no chance at all of getting the buttons through the button holes.  impossible!  has to go back
1,"I read the rave reviews  but tried this on with low expectations. i am curvier on top so i thought the dress would make my chest look huge and show my tummy budges. the dress was the exact opposite - so flattering and a piece i could truly dress up or down. i am 5'6""  135lbs and a small fit perfectly. i rarely purchase anything at full price but plan to circle back to my local retailer to pick this up today."
-1,Loved the look  fit and styling of this turtleneck. but dry clean only  you have to be kidding?
0,This dress fit perfectly  i think it fit just like it shows on the model i also think the color represents itself nicely in person as well. i do however think that the dress is over priced. for as often as you would wear this dress (given that isn't a basic black and would definitely be remembered by people were you to wear it more than once) i think the price is way too high.   a must have on sale or clearance  but probably not a keeper for me full price in this color combination  we will see t
1,I ordered the red motif in size xl. for me  the fit matches the model so i think it's true-to-size. the only larger area on me is for the armholes. i use a cami so my bra won't show when raising my arms. since it's made of rayon/spandex and is a longer length  it's a little clingy along my hipline for my pear-shape. but  overall  it's so soft and comfortable. the colors in the floral pattern are beautiful. prettier in person. there's no problem with pattern placement either. a great top for summ
0,This dress is very cute on the model online  but in person it is quite large and just hands there and doesn't do much for the figure. cute but not worth the $148 price tag.
-1,I usually love a cowl neck sweater but not this one. you can't wear it off the shoulders and it's weirdly sheer too. the only pro is that it doesn't include wool or fur.
-1,Just piping in here -- ordered my usual size of small petite. the slip that came with the dress is about a size negative zero  it could hardly squeeze over my body and the dress itself is a bright pale aqua and it is a shift. and because of the smocking it hangs very strangely. i think it looks very cheap and is ill fitting. i would say if you are a person on which shift dresses look awesome you might like this  but mind the size of the slip in the petites range  and also it is aqua.
-1,I was interested in this sweater because i actually thought it was a tunic. the sweater is much shorter than i thought. i wish i could return it. i bought a size large which is my normal size.
0,"I found this dress to be beautiful. only down side? you'd need to size up two sizes if you have any breasts or butt. i'm usually size s/m in maeve. i bought this in l and looked like a stuffed sausage. i'm 5'1""  140lbs  36d  39"" hips. i'd need an xl."
-1,I ordered this in white and it's quite sheer. as others have noted  it is really full and it hits at mid-hip which doesn't work on my figure. if it had been a few inches longer and more of a tunic  or less voluminous  it could have worked but nope.
1,Very comfortable and attractive pullover. not too long or bulky  although i find myself rolling the sleeves up to keep them out of the way!  but it's a keeper
1,This dress is very soft and ultra comfortable. i got a size 10 and probably could have gotten away with an 8 but due to being busty on top stuck with the 10. i love the length  even though i got the regular and not the petite.
-1,I received this dress in the mail yesterday. right away  i noticed the coloring wasn't quite the same as it appears in the images online. in person  the hints of brown appear more bronzy and shiny  as opposed to more muted. i was willing to look past that  but then i tried it on. i ordered a small  which is my typical size in retailer dresses. it ran quite large and was way to long for me (i am 5' 4''). overall  between the coloring and sizing  this dress wasn't a hit for me.
0,For my body type  this top looked ridiculous! i am small-busted and thinnish on top. this seemingly very pretty top look like a big rectangle on me. very unflattering. hard to tell if it was true-to-size because it hung so wide. i think for a gal with more substantial upper body (i.e.  boobs) this would work better.
0,I ordered this in a size 4 and it is great quality. the only problem is the size of the slip. the top is very tight across my average chest  but fine elsewhere - odd fit. the dress fits great and i debated finding another slip  but ultimately decided to return it.
1,"I was not sure whether i would like an xs or a s. rompers can be tricky. i am 5'6"" 123lbs. i went ahead and ordered the xs and it is perfect. it is just long enough in the body for me. the shorts length is perfect  not too short or too long. i can't wait to wear this!"
1,"This pants are very comfortable  and add a little flare to my typical ""mom pajama"" look. i found them true to size; size small fit my 5'7  135lbs frame. comfortable to sleep and lounge in!"
-1,I really wanted to like this because the color is beautiful and the knit is obviously good quality. but the shape is impossible to work with. it doesn't just run big  it just hangs there. really disappointing. it'll have to go back.
-1,I'm usually a maeve fan. i found this top to look cheap and fit poorly. it is also very thin material and showed everything.
-1,I love everything from retailer but this top did not fit all that flattering. the neck line fits a little weird. too bad. color was nice though. i returned the top.
1,Cute and comfy shirt! tts- got my usual m (i'm a 10) and it has a generous fit but i think it's supposed to. it's actually a silver grey color.
1,This was an impulse purchase for me. a year ago i would have never considered a jumpsuit but they are growing on me. i had yet to find one that fit without too much need for tailoring. this one did the trick! i like that the cut is in such a way that you can wear a normal bra underneath it without it showing. the fabric itself is very lightweight so i would recommend a bra for some support. i like that the fabric is incredibly lightweight so you can wear it on a hot summer day. the jumpsuit is l
-1,"It just didn't work for me. i don't know if it is my fair complexion and untanned legs  but this dress was a strike out. the orange floral design and beading is beautiful and the fitting i would say is pretty tts. for reference  i am 5'7"" and 145lbs with 36"" 30"" 40"" measurements and i purchased a medium. the chest and arms were not too tight like other reviews stated. the length is about the length in the picture and a lot of fabric to make it very flowy. overall  very good quality and beautiful"
1,This skirt is perfect! it just pulls on and lays nice and smooth. the fabric is soft and just the right thickness and stretch. i wore it with black tights and knee high boots for new year's eve and had many compliments! it runs a tad big. i am about 130lb and the small fits great although a tad larger than i would have expected. i assume it might srink in the wash a little anyway. my new favorite!
-1,This dress looked adorable online  but unfortunately  it's not flattering at all  and it's completely see-through. completely. the material is so thin that i can't imagine it would hold up very well over time. this one is definitely going back.
1,Love this sweater! great quality & styling. slimming and the side slits add a feminine appeal. pair with your legging and boots and enjoy the compliments.
1,Love these! so comfy and a great color! also love that it came in petite! it is so hard to find avoid crop pant in petite!!!
0,I found it very thin and much more sheer than i expected. not sure i could get away with wearing it without a slip.sadly i'll be returning it. also  runs a bit large. would have returned it for an xs if i loved it.
-1,When i wore this the two times i did  i got a ton of compliments. it runs small  and is a bit tight when sized correctly but its really stunning. after the second wear  the fabric under the arms frayed and its now unwearable. i have to return it and am so disappointed. sadly  i would not recommend buying it for that reason.
-1,I also expected this sweater to have more bulk to it per the images. it is very thin as others have said. the design is awkward with the sleeve placement and that makes it more flowy vs. structured. it is more similar to a cape or shawl design. if you;'re looking for a warm cozy blanket sweater design  this is not it. i will keep it though as a layering piece and because of the sale price and classic color design.
0,This is a gorgeous top; however  it is very sheer and see through. maybe the fabric would have been better if it was a bit thicker?
0,This dress is such a crazy beautiful color  the picture doesn't do it justice. i ordered this right when i saw it  and i almost love it. the color is very bright and the fabric seems nice  but i just didn't find it flattering at all. the slip wasn't the nicest  but completely not a deal breaker. i didn't think it was overly flattering on the model either  so i was hoping by some miracle that i would like it anyway  but something about the way it's cut is just a little off for me. it was very tru
1,Lovely dress that i recommend  just not for those with my body type.  i'm broader and rounder on top so i assumed the vertical stripes would slim me down.  from the front everything is awesome--from behind it was less flattering.  made my flat bum look flatter.  also the stripe patterns do not match at the break.  other than that the quality is fantastic  the fabric is a great transitional weight  the fit is comfortable  and the style is classic.
0,This is a pretty dress  although it runs smaller and the colors aren't as vibrant as on the website. the waist ran very small for me in a size 10 which is my normal size and normally runs looser in the waist area as i have an hour glass figure. this probably will look very nice on someone smaller.
-1,I'm a petite so as usual i have to order from retailer. i saw this on line and tried it on in a regular size in the store. even though of course it didnt fit  the style of the tee was nice so i ordered it. i couldnt have been more disappointed when i received it. the quality was truly awful. i'm not even sure why it is being sold. the neckline was warped and wouldn't lie flat again the neck or chest; the bottom hem was crooked. it was really bad. also having purchased tees in similar material befo
-1,I absolutely loved this top. it fit great and was easy to dress up or down. i wore it once and washed it according to the tag. cold water and flat dry. it is now 4 sizes too small and unwearable. extremely disgusted.
1,I needed a white denim pant and this one fits fine. it isn't as slimming as i had hoped for because it isn't a stretchier denim. but  my husband says he likes how they look and they do fit. pants are not easy for me. i have a generous booty and thighs and a small waist. quality is good.
-1,Don't buy this dress unless you are normally a medium or larger. order it one or two sizes smaller than your normal size. i ordered an xs and it's more like a medium or large.
1,Great buy. i bought the cream jumpsuit.  i'm small on bottom and larger on top. this was perfect  shouldn't fit tight  should flow  has lots of room  it is linen  adjustable buttons on front and adjustable on the back of jumpsuit. legs are wide and flowy. casual but classy. both sides have about 3 buttons at hips. great addition to any closet. unique in its own right.
0,I stumbled upon this item at my local retailer  and immediately had to true it on. the colors are so lovely in person. after trying it on  i was disappointed :( the material has a foamy/air feel to it  and the skirt seems to run small. needless to say  i didn't purchase this item.
1,This will be a great summer staple.  good fit and very comfortable.  may go back and buy another color
1,Love these! they are my new favorite weekend pant. they are comfortable  versatile  and cute. the fit and cut are great too. a must have for your wardrobe.
0,Got this in the moss color. i throw on a hoodie almost every day to walk my dog so i justified the high price. returned it because it was not cute on. the waffle fabric didn't stand out  and the bottom just hung straight. i thought it would be more ruffle-like. even on sale i won't buy it ~ it's just that blah
-1,This jacket is just too small for me anyway and i am no way big. i am tall and athletic and this thing looked like it had shrunk in the wash. there are so many better fitting other types out there  this went back
0,I ordered this dress in two sizes  pxs and ps. they both arrived in a timely manner but the pxs was snagged upon arrival. there were a few other reviewers that stated the dress snagged easily but i loved the classic look of this dress so i thought i would take the chance. unfortunately i had to take both back to the store because the potential for snagging the fabric was too high even considering the sale price. also  the dress comes with a cotton slip but the slip for the pxs was tiny while the
1,Since there isn't one where i live  i ran into retailer while waiting for my daughter to pick me up. saw this and bought it off the rack w/out trying on. had to get a m as they were out of s  and yes  it's a tad large on me  but still glad i got it. i think it will be a nice transition piece into fall in hot texas. love how the linen drapes and it makes me feel a bit more dressed up than a cotton tee. the ruching on the sleeves is an extra nice touch.
0,Like the previous reviewer  the biggest problem with this shirt is how short it is. i'm 5'4 and ordered a 12  which is usually what i wear at retailer. even only being 5'4  this shirt is much shorter than i anticipated. it fits everywhere else  though. i'm obsessed with the back so i'm going to keep it and wear it. i'd say it's worth it at the sale price.
1,I am 9 months post baby and still have some body self-confidence issues. i am just not ready nor do i think i want to ever wear a two piece again so i was looking for something that was still made me feel attractive. this swimsuit does the trick. makes me chest looks awesome and my tummy super flat. love this suit!!!
1,It is one of my favorites from retailer. i received so many compliments while wearing it! i usually wear a 6 but i sized down to a 4 and still had plenty of room.
1,I ordered this dress online and did not realize it had beaded details on the bodice... gorgeous dress - perfect for festival season.
-1,This suit did nothing for me. the top has zero support. this would work for a younger woman who does not require any support and is smaller chested. also  the top gapped in the center. it just did not fit right. the top is very thin showing everything. a light padding would make a big difference in this suit. also i could not get a good fit. as i tightened the top  the back would ride up. the bottoms are ok. not renatkable
0,I thought this top had shimmery dots  that is what it looks like in the picture. but when it arrived  it looks much plainer in-person and i could not believe it was this top. the dots are polka dots. the embroidery at the v-neck doesn't stand out much in the photo but it does in-person. the top runs true to size but the fit didn't feel as perfect for me. i am sending it back. i needed a more shimmery top.
1,These pants are perfect for any casual occasion. they can be worn to run errands  hang around the house  or even go out with friends. i love how versatile they are and they are so roomy for those times when you don't want to wear jeans or anything tight. they are a bit pricy  but i'm very happy with how they fit.
-1,Material is too thin and quality is poor
0,I purchased these on sale and am only keeping them because they were such a low price. i ordered the 2 petite  but they do not actually seem to be made for a petite person. they are still very long (to my ankles) and the legs are very wide. the waist fits fine though.
0,"I loved the pattern  color and mock turtleneck style of this top  but it was just too short on me. i purchased the xs in the ivory color (i am 5'5""  32d  110 lbs for reference). i had planned to layer this under jackets for work  but every time i raised my arms  you could see my stomach. i would not have felt comfortable wearing it to work because of this. the fit was slightly boxy also  and it was not flattering when i tucked it into a skirt because the boxy shape caused the shirt to bunch up s"
-1,This was disappointing to me. i love how this looks on the model. unfortunately it made me look huge. it was all bunched up after i buttoned and put it on. i didn't find it was tts  i am a 10 m and got the m. it was too tight in the waist. before i'd even put it on  i noticed the waist looked very small. i don't even think the sizing issue caused the material bunching. it's like the buttons didn't match up or something.
-1,Very disappointed in this top. i have a short waist  and it was still too short for me. :-(
0,This sweater was unflattering me  very boxy and did not fall on me like the model. soft fabric and looks nice off  however this one went back.
0,A little boxy but will be a go to basic. the off set ruffle gives interest
0,I purchased this on sale  xxs petite and i'm glad i did. it's an adorable sweater  but i knew the moment i put it on - itch city! bummer. i wore it with a tank underneath and that helped. it's a very warm sweater and the style is really cute. looks really soft and cozy  but i would say itchy and cozy!
1,This looks just as pictured. it's comfortable but dressy. i love it!
0,They are beautiful in person  until you put the on. the fit was a bit weird; tighter in the waist  roomy in the crotch. the fabrics work 100% against one another. the vegan leather  especially the detail pieces at the outer side seams  is too stiff. the back is thin and has far too much elasticity. at $150 i passed. these will only enter my closet on sale.
0,I got the black in a medium. it just made me look wide and i felt frumpy. i think it's the angled wide sides. on me  the design just created bulk. nice substantial fabric but it isn't soft or cozy. back it goes
1,I bought this dress for an upcoming bridal shower i am attending. it fits great  is flattering  and i can also wear it to work since it is long enough.    overall it was a great purchase!
0,This dress is such a beautiful color and the fabric is super soft and lovely. it would be stunning on someone with a slim figure  but since i've got curves/an athletic build  it simply did not work. too bad  because it is such a pretty dress!
1,"I was so excited to see that these were on sale post holidays. love the style and the fit. my only disappointment was that they don't have as much stretch as i thought they would (i wrote above that it ""runs small"" but if it had more stretch then the sizing would be ok). for reference i'm 5'5 and 10. i usually wear 25 in pilcro pants but these felt tighter. i would exchange for a 26 but they're sold out unfortunately!"
0,This jacket looks great and is well made. the material is very lush however the body of the jacket runs big while the sleeves are tight.
0,What a let down. this is not what i would call a coat but a sweater. it is unlined and very lightweight. the fit was cute and would have been so great if it was actually a coat.
0,"Im 5'1"" and about 110lbs. ordered the small because i do have some curves- it was huge- more like a large and didnt have much structure at all. the wool was very soft and stretchy. and like others have said- kinda orange- not true coral color. it fit me like a throw blanket- its going back for sure. might purchase again if the petite xs is back in stock and on sale- this should def be under $100."
-1,"I loved this top but the cut was too short in the waist for my 5'8"" frame. wish it came in a tall size!"
0,This top looks real cute on the model! wish it looked like that on me! way too big  so not flattering on my petite frame. sadly going back!
0,I fell in love with this dress when the catalog came in the mail and jumped online immediately to order it. the dress just arrived and is not as pictured in the catalog - the picture of the model walking on the beach. in that picture it appears to have black lining or a black slip underneath when in reality there is nude lining sewn into every edge and isn't going anywhere - for a minute i thought about having it removed by a tailor but it seems the entire dress would have to be re-sewn. some of
0,"I loved these pants.they are so comfortable. however  after just wearing them twice  the threads of the leaves are fraying  and leaving lint on whatever i sit on. the leaves at the seat of the pants are now slowly disappearing. this after wearing twice to work! i imagine after a few more wears that the leaves at the seat of the pants will be close to gone  or at least much less ""white"" with threads then the rest of the places. this is super unfortunate and will be returning. too bad  they were l"
1,A must have 1 piece. every time i wear this i get compliments! it's very flattering  amazing quality  soft material  good support and vibrant colors! i wish this came in more colors and patterns. worth the money no questions asked!
0,I really wanted to love this sweater after reading all the reviews  but it just didn't work for me. the pattern is amazing (almost a little over powering  making it one of a kind and unique) but what i didn't like the color of the knit collar and front bands----it's an old looking mauve-tweed grandpa color. i probably would have kept it if that color was different. it was returned to find a different coat style sweater.
0,"Like a previous reviewer  i love white blouses -- nothing better. also love polka dots  so i grabbed this at my retailer store the minute i saw it without even trying it on. quality is good; nice material. maybe a little heavy for summer. but it really didn't work on me. i normally wear a small in tops  however with a 34d chest (5'5"" 122 lbs) i do sometimes get a bit of gapping with blouses at the chest. this does not gap but it just hangs on me. if it was a true peplum and fitted at the waist i t"
-1,I tried on this top and it looked fine until i tried to move. you can't lift your arms. i tried on a larger size but still felt like the movement was limited in the back and arm areas.
-1,"If these jeans work for you  you're a lucky girl! the fabric is really thick and soft. pocket detail is cool and the hidden multicolored button placket is a nice detail. i ordered down a size. they're tight across my thighs and seem shorter than a 30"" inseam. the fit is boxy and not flattering on me but pants are so cute i may keep them anyway."
0,I liked the colors and the design but it's kind of an odd fabric  no give at all and no drape. stiff and kind of structured feeling for a casual cardigan. the sleeves are extremely narrow and tight. i ordered a medium and it felt like a ace bandage squeezing my arms. my arms are normal sized. if you have exceptionally narrow arms  might work for you. sending it back.
-1,I am reasonably petite  but i like sweaters very oversized and large  so i ordered this sweater in a large. i was very disappointed when the sweater came because while the sleeves and upper chest area were in large  the length of the sweater did not at all increase when the size did. because the lower part of the sweater did not increase in size  the sweater ended up looking very awkward  with the chest and sleeves very large and long but then a very tight and short (waist-length) stomach. i do
1,I was not so sure i would like this dress as i was afraid it may be too boxy looking. per other reviews i took a chance...i love it!  so sweet with my grey boots and just dressy enough...but still casual and fun.  detail work is very nicely done.
1,"This sweater is of nice quality and has such great detail to it - love the pattern to the knit and the ribbon detail is unique and beautiful. the knit itself is of mid to thicker weight  so definitely appropriate for winter  fall  and cooler spring days. i bought my normal size small and felt like it had more of a slub fit than pictured in the model shot - it was wider down the torso and a little shorter (not tunic length like picture). i'm 5'7"" with a longer torso and this hit maybe mid-bum and"
-1,"After trying several sizes  including petite and regular  i am sad to return this dress. the regular sizes were too long on me (i am 5'4"") and although the petite fit me just a little short  the biggest issue was how tent like it fit me. i wanted it to look like it does on the model but i just couldn't get the fit. usually i have great luck with cloth & stone."
0,"The material and construction of the pants are great  but the length is just plain awkward. i'm 5'4"" and the regular came to just above my ankles  and looked as though they had shrunk in the wash in a really bad way. a couple of inches longer and they would've been fine  or i could've gotten them in petite and worn them as true ankle-length pants  but the regular just didn't do it for me. also i'm usually a size 6 (5'4""  125lbs) and these were a little baggy around the waist and hips."
0,I ordered this top in red. gorgeous color and detail  however just wasn't flattering on my more curvy shape. felt like it looked like a maternity top.
1,My absolute favorite dress yet from retailer! i wore it to numerous events this past summer and felt like $1 000 000.! glad it's on sale now for others to snatch up.
1,Yes! i love the color  the fabric and the fit up top. the skirt  however  is very poofy. i am going to let it hang for awhile (it was an online order) and see if some of that relaxes. otherwise  i will need to return it.
-1,I have been looking at this sweater online since it first came out and i finally ordered it when it was 40% off. i ordered a size m petite  sadly when it arrived and i tried it on  it was very boxy  stiff like  and did not flow like it looked on the model online so i sent it back.
-1,This is a problem i have had with the pilcro hyphen cargos with the color dye.  the dyes in these pants are the same thing. i wore the purple color and washed in cold  gentle  cycle and they were stained/     i will return these -it's too bad because they were pretty comfortable and flattering pants.
-1,"I am typically a small/6 in dresses  but i should have gone with the other reviewers and sized down. it had no shape  but hung like a paper sack. the armholes fit perfectly though  if i had sized down they may have been too tight. i am 5'6"" 140 lb  i will return  too bad because it is a pretty dress!"
1,This dress is so soft and cozy and pretty.  love the shine and interesting sheen whenever you move.  very comfortable and looks great with a variety of layers. i want to buy more colors but right now i just have the mauve. ordered size m and i'm 38-27-35 #135.
1,Great purchase. true to size. so flattering. love it simplicity.. buy it if you enjoy compliments!
-1,But  it just doesn't measure up. first  the slip/lining comes unattached if pulled slightly and it is very difficult to actually get it on - either stepping into it or pulling it over your head. and  once on  the top was a big snug and there was too much material at the bottom which made it look really bulky. unfortunately  i am finding this to be the case with so many of the items i buy from retailer lately. the material is really cute  but the dress isn't worth the price / effort.
1,"So pretty. 5'4"" 115 lbs and the xs fits perfectly."
-1,I am not sure who would look good in this dress. it is extremely oversized with tons of fabric that will not flatter anyone!
0,"I ordered this online and was disappointed with the fit when it arrived. i ordered the xs and it was still oversize to the point of being unflattering. i am tall 5'9"" about 130 pounds and have a fairly thin torso and look best in cloths that have some shape. if you like a loose fit this might be for you. the material is thicker and warm and comfortable. i would suggest ordering down a size."
1,These tights are exactly what i was looking for! they are a great weight for the winter months and can be worn out/dressed up or for lounging around at the house. they are a nice weight and durable construction. i plan to pair them with skirts  tunics and dresses. they are super cute with ankle boots.
0,I'm 5.1 and always bought 27p. they didn't have petite anymore  so i bought 27r  knowing that it'll hit my ankle instead of being cropped. it's very cute as an ankle-length with some flare. my only issue is that the 27r was very tight around the crotch and upper thigh. it's a very tight fit just right there!... and not enough of stretch to be comfortable when sitting. i wonder if it will stretch out a bit more from wear? i then ordered a 28r to see if that fits better  and it fits a tad loose ev
-1,This skirt is very short. i ordered my usual xs petite and it was so short that the longest part ended above my ankle. that's quite off because i'm only 5 feet tall  and i wore it pretty low on the hips. it also flares out awkwardly below the knee. there are 2 vertical seems and they exacerbate the jagged appearance of the hem. i was drawn to the edgy style shown in the photo but in person it looks like my 5 year old cut up a skirt. plus  the fabric--while thick and beautiful and stretchy--has a
-1,The peplum for this time hit me in the middle of my rib cage  not at my natural waist  so it looked very odd when it flared out with the peplum so high up. i am busty so it's possible this would not be the case for everyone but i generally can wear peplum tops with no problem. i was disappointed to return it  the fabric was very nice and the concept behind the shirt was a good one.
1,First  i did not notice the description mentioning metallic thread. i was disappointed when i opened the box to find it is a metallic  but actually i'm glad i didn't know because i love it. it does not look cheap and it really works. the pale peachy color is gorgeous and the metallic is subtle enough. the real issue for me is the size. i ordered the small and it is huge. enormous. especially from the back. the seam on the sleeve is just above my elbow so it's almost a bat wing kind of thing and
1,I love this bralette. i have it in other colors as well and it is always the one i go to when i want comfort.
1,Love these pilcro jeans  my usual size fit nice like skinny jeans. i know if i had gone down a size they would look too tight in the legs  they are not supposed to be leggings. they did not stretch out too much all day - slightly in the waist  not enough to size down. the dark color is perfect for winter! they are very comfortable!! love pilcro jeans!
0,I carefully read the reviews and decided to order a medium since that size works for me generally with floaty styles. the neck was a bit small but once over my head it fit and looked nice. the deal breaker for me is the huge droopy armholes that showed half my bra. the colors are deeper than shown. but the pattern and length overwhelmed my shape feeling a lot like a maternity top. i liked that the sides are shorter but overall it's just not my style. better suited i think for taller  slimmer bod
-1,Don't be fooled by the image; unless you have a c/d chest  this romper has masses of draped fabric right around your middle--exactly where you want it least! very unflattering and rather expensive for the poor quality. back it goes!
-1,"The quality and fabric are fabulous but it's just too voluminous for my figure (5'8""  155 lbs)  would look great on someone more slender."
1,"I am returning the dress because it smells heavily of the last purchaser's deodorant and perfume. it was actually nauseating to put on. i am disappointed with retailer that i was sold this dress  full price  in this condition. otherwise  the dress is lovely. it is true to size. i am 5'5"" 110 lbs and the size 0 was perfect."
-1,I had been eyeing this coat for a few weeks after it appeared in the email  and i finally decided to purchase it to treat myself. i was very excited to get it  as it is a beautiful coat online. however  once i received it i was very disappointed. the material is much thinner than i would expect for something that cost $168  and when i went to button it the button slipped right off the thread it was sewn onto the coat with. i checked the other buttons and all of them were loose as well.     perso
0,This caught my eye and i tried it on the in the store today (the green). i found it to run a little bit large - i expected the small to fit  but the xs fit me better (better fit in armholes and also less billowy). i really like the way it looks  but ulitimately did not purchase it today. i might reconsider on sale. the flaws (in my opinion) are that it is dry clean only  the skirt is not lined (and should be)  and it's a bit overpriced for the quality. but on the other hand  it's very cute and f
1,I love this vest! it is a great color and the inside is very soft! i will definitely be able to dress it up or down.  if you are in between sizes i would definitely size up if you plan on wearing this with a little heavier turtleneck/blouse underneath.  it's amazing! i feel so confident in it!
0,I really like how this looks on the model  but in real life this top is much tighter. i was hoping for a good layering top and have been playing around with the trend of lace up tops. i bought it without trying on figuring a small would work  but it was much too tight and the lace top reminded me of vans shoes. i returned it  a girl much tinier than myself has it and it is very cute on her. so  best works on a model body type figure than someone with even slight hips.
-1,So sad becuase i like the design. i would not recomend the lack to anyone that does not live and work and shop in a completely immaculate environment. i wore this to work the day after purchasing and within three hours i honestly looked like i had slept in this sweater for three monthe straight. i had to take the sweater off and work in a t-shirt.   the marigold color may be better than the black abut showing lint but something intrinsic to the fabric really attracts lint like nothing i have eve
-1,I bought a size small in this dress even though i am usually a large at retailer. it just hung strangely and clung to the unflattering parts of my body but seemed very large. i loved the feel  color (grey) and style of the dress  but i ended up returning it because of the fit. it also requires something under it since it is fairly see-through.
-1,I got these in the mail today and to me  they look exactly like the pants my mamaw used to wear in the 80s. they were super comfy but not cute at all on me. they do run large like other reviews say. i am usually an 8/10 or med and these in the small were the right choice. going back because they just look horrible on me though
1,"I love this top! i purchased the gray simply because i felt it would go with more. i can pair it with blue jeans  my pink pilcro chinos  and even my turquoise pilcro shorts. i love that this tee doesn't have the rolled sleeves  so it's a little more finished looking. i tried on both the small and medium and both fit  but i preferred the tapered fit of the small and ultimately went with that. for reference  i'm 5'8""  140 lbs  32d chest. i do think $58 is hefty for a t-shirt  so you could roll the"
0,I wanted to love this but if you carry your weight in your hips  butt or thighs this is not the dress for you. runs tts. i'm 5'5  135 lb and the small fit but made my lower half look even wider than what it it. also felt like it was a bit too long in length.
1,The cut and design of this dress is lovely! the fabric is heavy enough for fall/winter  but the sleeveless style makes it a great transition piece for when the weather warms up again. it does run slightly larger than most other retailer dresses. i sized down to a 2 from a 4. the bust stretches a bit for the ladies who might be heavier on top (i'm a 34 dd)  however  i noticed the white shows through in dark places around my bust. also  the boning in the front pushed against the fabric a bit
1,This is a unique blouse  it reminds me of the unique items i would find at the store many years ago. it is a gorgeous item. it does have a boxy fit  but it is not unflattering. i am very pleased with this purchase and would recommend this product.   the quality is nice and it is an item that people will notice.
1,This is a beautiful casual top...it is a loose fit that is generously sized so instead of my usual large i purchased the medium for a better fit...the length is perfect not too long or short! the colors coordinate great with denim!
-1,I really wanted to love this blazer...i've even tried it on several times hoping it would look better the next time around. (spoiler: it didn't :( ). overall  it makes me look pretty frumpy and not put together. i really love saturday/sunday brand and was hoping for a nice comfy blazer to wear to work. will be returning instead.
1,"I ordered these in my typical size  26  and they fit everywhere perfectly except the butt. for me  i found them to be too tight in that area. i went to the store and tried on the 27 and they were too big in the waist. i do recommend them though. they are well made  i loved the wash and the length was perfect. being 5'3"" they came to the lower ankle and that was fine with me. give them a try  hopefully they work better for you."
1,This is a beautiful  artistic piece for your wardrobe! seriously  rosie neira is a talented  london-based designer  who will thrill you with her vision. she is expert at making a woman look amazing from every direction; these knits are stunning  the materials and workmanship flawless. the medium fits me as expected (size 8  medium top  34f). i was drawn to this by the rosie neira label  the flowing front drape and slightly longer back  the gorgeous knit quality and design  and the way it makes m
-1,Love this dress! wore it last night for a musical event... came home and put it on the hand wash setting in the washer with cold water...just as the label states. pulled the dress out and guess what? the design is completely faded!!! it looks 5 years old :( so sad. i'm going to call retailer and ask for a refund (i live two hours away)
0,I am a true to size 4 and when this bathing suit arrived it looks like it's a kids 4. i will exchange for an 8 and hope for the best. the quality looks great and the styling is beautiful but i could barely get into the suit.
0,I usually wear an 8  which wasn't available  and sized up to the 10 which fit just fine as there is no stretch and it's a set-in waist band. the fabric is pretty  the skirt is fully lined  the length is not too short  and the only thing i don't like is the big bronzey toothed zipper - it looks ok on the beige version  but on the black it stands out.    it's perfect for summer but i could also see wearing the black version during holidays.
-1,"These pants are more like 9"" not 10"". i was very dissappointed. the color is great and so is the fabric.  if you look more closely at the model the pants don't fit her either!! they are too small! i haven't decided whether or not to take them back because i am losing weight. i am a 31 so far but these pants are like a 30. i need the color because they go perfectly with a top i bought from retailer"
-1,The turqoise color is pretty  however  it did smell bad out of the package. i wore it once and it transferred the dye to my skin and white pants  bra and cami! hope it all comes out in the wash. i tried to hand wash the shirt and now have blue hands and a blue tub.
0,Drawn to the colors  i tried on the top in my regular size m. fyi: 36c  broad shoulders/back  short waist  size 10/12 or l in fitted tops  this top is a cropped  even for my short-waisted body. i would have to wear a cami under. this is not just because of the cropped length (top rides up w/ any movement)  but the burn-out velvet is quite sheer. the top is full  so it easily exposes with any movement. the back of slides up  too. the quality is an issue  with exposed threads and irregular seams.
-1,I ordered a regular size s and it was way too boxy for my body type and shorter than the stated length. i don't know if the length stated is from a size m  but the small was definitely shorter (in the front at least).  if you're petite with curves like me  it's not a flattering cut.
0,The fit on these is good for my hourglass shape  and the fabric quality and comfort is good too.i think the rinse is just not as nice in person- the orange stitching is pretty bright too. i bought. a pair from br a couple months ago that are almost identical in quality  fit and color that i got for less than half the price of these. i am going to return these and see if they have something better   but will only buy in store from now on.
1,Love this sweater! it is so cozy! i gave it a four because it does shed a lot. i have not washed yet but hopefully that will help with the shedding. i am hoping to buy other colors.
0,"Recently started loving rockets. i own a pair in black and a pair that are distressed. i've found that the 27s fit me best. i am 5'7""  34c  28 waist. this particular pair seems to run true to size  meaning i could get the 28s on (which is typically what i wear in other brands)  but the 27s were embarassingly too small. while the 28s fit  and are made of a great weighty denim  with very little stretch  the wash was really not appealing. due to the distressing of the wash  all the lines butterfly"
0,Interesting  slightly transparent fabric. neckline is not so open as pictured. body is boxier than pictured.  would recommend as a maybe.
1,I bought this dress for work and post work happy hours. love it! it's material is high quality and is flattering since it falls nicely on my postpartum figure. it's a little shorter than i thought but still appropriate for work.
0,These pants come in great colors and fit nicely if you determine your correct size  which may not be what you usually wear. i have several pair  but i am concerned about investing anymore because of all the complaints on dye stability. retailer is going to have to address this if it is going to continue carrying this product. now  that said  i had a bad accident on one pair of these pants  and the outcome was successful. i wore them to a dinner party and spilled grease on them from one of t
1,I haven't worn a halter dress in ages and saw this one and wanted to get it  hoping that it'll fit me.     i love the swing skirt and the halter. this dress can be easily dressed up or down depending on your mood. there is a side zipper.     i got s p and it hits me exactly like the dress on the model. it is unlined but with the color of the dress  i don't mind it.
0,First  this sweater drapes beautifully and has a unique look.   however  there are several items to note. primarily  this sweater is very expensive. the wool has an itchy feel. the &quot;drape&quot; is a second layer under the cardigan so it creates a liner but it is not sewn in at the bottom. so it is annoying when you first put it on. it is at least sewn in on the inside of the cardigan at the top. i also notice that the seams are sewn white or are falling apart already on the sleeves.
0,This is pretty and provides coverage with a bit of support for wearing around the house. i'm a 34b so i ordered the small- it still had room in it so i tightened the straps and used the tightest hooks on the back  and that makes it fit ok. i bought it just to wear at home since i was not expecting a great deal of support or shaping  and while it feels ok it is not super-comfy- it's a bit scratchy around the edges. i was going to buy another color if i loved this  but as it is i will keep the one
0,These jeans fit perfectly. however  the distress at the knee was a bit too distressed for my taste. i would recommend these jeans for a younger demographic.
-1,"Dress appears to be slim fit  but that's far from the case. usually wear an xs regular because i have a long torso for my 5'3""  but it just hung on me like a heavy sack. i have a hard time finding dresses now that i'm not working and like to have a couple on hand for all purpose occasions--weddings  memorials  special occasions. i hoped this one would meet my needs. disappointed."
1,Love this top.  the fit is perfection!  the fabric is wonderfully soft.  i ordered the green  love this color.  will be ordering it in the grey also..  fits very true to size.
0,While this top is pretty  it's very unflattering. it just looks so boxy on me that it makes me look heavier. too bad  because i really wanted to like it.
0,This is beautiful fabric and a good fit  but it's such a pain to get on and off  that i just don't want to hassle with it. the button is in the back  and very tricky to reach. too bad  because otherwise it's darling!
1,I love the dress overall  however  found it a tad snug in the bust area. overall  a beautiful dress to own.
0,The item i received was not distressed. i bought one size larger thinking they'd be super slouchy  but they just looked sloppy. also  the hips puffed out in a very strange way. i wanted to love since they are so cute and soft  but i look like a man with hips in these jeans. returning this weekend.
0,I ordered the white tee in xs and am returning it. it runs tts & had a good fit but i didn't like the material at all. maybe because it was white  but it was see through & like a tissue tee that i would expect to get little holes in it near the waist. the sleeves are gathered in the center of the sleeve & i didn't like the way that looked.
-1,The first time i wore this tank it started pilling around the arms and down the sides. it is terribly quality  and gets worse with every wear and wash. possibly the worst wear on a new clothing item i've ever seen. like the design and fit  immediately relegated it to a weekend/home shirt because it was unprofessionally pilly and the pills are small so can't be shaved off.
-1,Love the fabric of this shirt even though it was thinner than i expected. it is soft to the skin and flattering. however i returned it because it is made for women with long torso and shorter shoulders.
0,Fabulous fabric  adorable details. fitting is very  very odd. it's non-adjustable in any way. the fabric has no stretch at all around the middle and the underwire of the bra is very stiff which i found painful. the straps were kind of loose  but there is no way to tighten them because of the frills. when i bent over  the shorts exposed the bottom of my butt. i'd get a larger size  but then i can't adjust the straps and they would definitely be too long and leave my breasts very exposed. overall 
-1,As the other reviewer stated the dress is not lined and the fabric feels very cheap. i tried the sp as well and felt i could have gone down to the xsp. i like the style and coloring but given the price and lack of quality this is going back.
1,I purchased this in my usual small (size 4-6) and it fits just the way it shows in the photo. it is very flowy which is th point. i wore it over a black romper and it looked great. i can also wear with jeans and a simple black tank. keep the vest open or use the hook and eye and close it up. seeing the black through the sheer white is simply dreamy!  glad i purchased it during the sale on sale promotion. it is a classic piece for sure.
1,"An retailer associate gave me this to try on since i love white clothing and lace. i tried on a large for my 5'9""  36c. hourglass frame and found it to be a tad large and probably could go down a size. my thoughts are.... _______________ pros: - breathable and comfortable fabric due to cotton/linen blend. - lace detailing at the top is lovely. - runs tts except i found the arms ran a tad small (and i have smaller circumference). but there's enough stretch. _______________ cons: - extremely sheer!"
-1,This looked fabulous on the model  of course  and i love sweater dresses. but even in an xs  i was drowning in fabric and looked ludicrous. concept is good but execution went terribly wrong somewhere. a definite return.
0,"I don't think the sweater looks like the one pictured. it's pretty and i love off the shoulder sweaters  but i have to say it's a little scratchy and its a lighter grey than what shows on my computer screen. if i hadn't gotten it on sale and with an additional birthday discount i would send it back. it also runs big. i got an xs/s and it fits perfectly. im 5'6"" and weigh 140. i usually wear a medium in most things and am a size 8. i like it a lot  but i don't love it. it also reeked of patchouli"
0,I first have to agree with other reviewers about the quality of this sweater: the stitch is pretty  but the fabric isn't nearly as soft as i expected. it has the look and feel of a cheaper sweater. that said  the fit is pretty flattering. i didn't have any problem getting the cowl over my shoulders as pictured by the model. i've been looking for this style of sweater  so i'll probably keep it. however  it really didn't meet my expectations for quality.
1,I bought this dress after i had overnighted a different one and it wasn't going to be delivered on time. i'm so happy that i bought this dress. its so comfortable and easy to wear. i got lots of compliments on it.  it runs very large though. i ended up with a size 6. i initially tried on the 10  as i have a larger chest. the 6 still had plenty of room.
1,I bought this sweater on a whim in the store  without trying it on. when i got home  i decided it would probably lose it's shape and it seemed a big clunky sweater and i planned to return it. a few days later  desperate for something to wear  i grabbed it and decided to keep it - merely to have something to wear that day. i'm so glad i did.    this is a great sweater. layered with a cami  it looks fantastic it does not lose its shape or grow. it is structured  so it doesn't feel sloppy. it has w
-1,Comments. the detail is lovely - especially the dragonflies on the sleeve. and the quality is there with the lining. trouble is this is thick fabric cut in a box shape. imo  you have to be very skinny to pull this off and not look like a tank. i looked at the model (after purchasing) and notice that she has it open and swept back a bit bc if it is not  it is terribly unflattering.
-1,If you have any cleavage this dress will look awful. the ties drop pretty low & look trashy over cleavage. recommend otherwise - good fabric cool look
-1,Like others  i finally received my size 6p black pants after months of waiting.  for starters  these pants run small  so i ordered a size up but still in petite  because i adored the red ones i got this past summer.  when the black pants arrived  they were a full three inches shorter than the red ones (which were also 6p)  and the fabric did not feel anywhere close to the same quality.  i'm debating ordering the regular length  but i'm not sure i'll bother  based on some of the other reviews.
1,Really great best.  nice substantial material and great fit.  will be able to wear with many things.
1,This looks just like the picture. it's soft and very comfortable - looks great with skinny jeans and boots. love it!
-1,I wanted to love this sweater but the fit is just awkward. it is very short and box and ends up being very short in the back. i am going to return this item.
1,Ranna designs richly detailed dresses and this is no exception.  looks just like the pictures (colors/cut/drape) with the exception of a modesty hook at the deep v-neck.  sleeves are sheer with an elastic cuff.  this dress does not stretch--the bodice felt very fitted and tight  especially at the waist band.  runs tts or small; if you're busty/broad shouldered  size up.  it has a dreadful side zip  is fully lined and all synthetic fabric (boo!)  i purchased size 10p  my stats 36c/38-27-35/135#.
-1,Even in my usual petite small size  this looked bulky and made me look stumpy. disappointing because the style looks so good in the picture and the material looks to be good quality. i don't even know if going down a size would have helped. as others have mentioned it looks like a frumpy house robe.
0,The sweater is beautiful. i loved the tweed design. but the fit was boxy and the collar sat funny. so i had to send it back.
1,I received the pants and they are really nice. you can dress them up or down. i ordered a size 0 in regular and they did not fit me well around my thighs  as they were loose. i will have to return them as they do not have my size in petites. i am a size 0 in petites and ordered the size 0 in regular. the only downside to the pants was it was hard to undo the buttons and found it rather difficult.
0,This sweater in the neutral beige coloration was exactly what i wanted to rotate through my winter legging/boot rotation with different vests  belts  and scarves...spot on. it is not heavy weight  soft  perfect length for a tunic on a 5'4 frame  34c  125 lb....now the weird part - sleeves were excessively long and seem to have stretched longer after wear??? anyway  hand wash and little to no pilling a plus. i literally roll up the sleeves to wear this tunic and it tends to be bothersome  hence t
-1,I love everything about this except the length. i am short and usually order a petite and even this is really cropped on me. the quality is good  thick and substantial  color is great but very cropped and sleeves are long on me as well. just weird proportions so sadly  going back.
-1,Bought two of these because i loved the way they fit off of the rack. washed them according to directions and they were ruined. the material shrank up making the shirt short and boxy and the side panels ended up being rippled. definitely going to try to return these.
0,Online  i like the design  the leaves stand out. in-person  the leaves don't stand out as much  you can barely see them they are so light. the top is slightly see-through. the price is high. i think this top would work better on a more slender frame. i like the top but the price is too high for the quality and thin fabric. it may look better on a slender frame  i think. it was just too light and thin for me.
0,Not for petite women  you need to have a long figure for this tunic to drape like it does on the model. if it ever goes on sale i will purchase it but not worth the full price for me at the moment.
0,I ordered this in a m and it was just a big boxy tent. i really wanted to love it since the length is good for leggings and throwing on to cart kids around. it just was so big and had no shape at all. it's possible i should have sized down to a small  but i'm sending it back.
0,Great summer skirt  can be dressed up or down. the band top is weird  but you don't have to style it as pictured. i may get the top hemmed down the road.    i have a 32 waist and got a size large.
-1,I bought this top in the blue motif and loved it so so very much until i washed it. it came out of the wash (delicate/cold cycle) with 3 small holes. i am devastated because it was destined to be my favorite top for summer. it is flattering  lightweight  gorgeous color  cool raw edges  v-back detail...i could go on and on about all the things i love about this top  but now it has holes after one washing so it's all for naught. do-over please with better fabric qa.
-1,I loved how soft this dress was  as well as versatile. however  i only got to wear it one time because after the first wash  a giant fabric tear happened on one of the seams. unfortunately  the fabric is so soft  but rather thin  and it didn't hold. the care instructions say machine washable but i wouldn't put it in the washing machine again. especially since i often have to wash clothes twice in the washer i use because it's so old and barely agitates. would love this if it was made a little be
1,I agree with others that the shape is not perfect  it does billow a bit by the hips. but the xxs petite (someone returned) was good on me. length was perfect  sleeve were not too tights. (30dd  26.5 in waist  35 in hips  115 lbs)  colors are subdued  making the jacket more neutral. keeping in mind for later...
-1,I really wanted to like this top  just got it in mail today  but unfortunately it did not work well for me because i'm 6 ft tall and the blouse was too short. i like the look and how it feels and i haven't completely decided whether to return it  but here are the issues i have encountered with this top. the blouse is very pretty and has a nice refreshing style with good print and color  very soft too  unusual for rayon of this type  feels more like thin delicate cotton. i got my top in red  size
0,I really liked this dress in so many ways. i'm tall and pear-shaped so the flowy shape is great for me. however  the deal-breaker was how the armholes were cut. it isn't that obvious in the photos  but they are cut in around the bust in the front in a way that was really weird looking on me  and it was too expensive to keep something that's unflattering. too bad  if they had just had a normal armhole it would have been a home run. lovely fabric and nice that it has pockets.
0,Plan to order at least one size smaller than you think  it's way baggy
1,Fun top for day or evening.
1,This is nicer than the first reviewer states. the fabric feels very soft and the tunic does not look cheap.the top of the tunic was a little more fitted so it was a little tight for me since i have wide shoulders. i will have to get a larger size.
0,"I like what they were going for here  and the fabric. but it falls short in that i can't wear it to work---the back ""keyhole"" is massive so i can't wear my normal bras  and the very wide neck also shows bra straps  so unless i want to go with a strapless bra  it's not useful for me. i want to feel loose and soft and summer comfy and my strapless bras are anything but that. i'd go without  but that is a no-no where i work. i may try getting a size smaller. i wear a med. and i got a small and mayb"
-1,I bought this online. this looked like a sweater that was accidentally shrunk in the dryer  when i received it.    i will be returning this.
-1,The model looks like she's 14 years old - this sweater of course would fit a younger teen. it definitely won't work for a grown woman. please make some longer sweaters.
1,Like other reviewers  i tried on a medium and a large as i usually take either size in retailer dresses. the large was huge on me - i had an extra 6 inches or so on each side. the next medium that i tried on could barely fit over my head! i looked at the tag to see if i had picked up an extra small but it stated medium. got another medium and it fit perfectly. however  the cami underneath one medium was again teeny tiny. the other medium was ok. you may have to try on a few dresses to get the righ
1,Cute top but does stretch out a bit throughout the day.
1,Fits pretty true to size  thick material  sits nicely.
1,This is a stunning dress. fits true to size  very high quality  has a very flattering shape  and the lace embroidery is gorgeous.
1,Nice loose-fitting dress to wear in the summer and to transition into the fall. i had no problem with the slip being too tight. 5'3''  118lbs  and went with my normal size 2. it was loose through the body but sizing down would have made the dress too tight on my shoulders. it's great with boots or flats!
-1,After washing this top pilled terribly. it is beautiful  but only for one use.
1,Wonderful fabric  drapes nicely from waist= flattering  use for air travel as not too heavy in weght. beautiful charcoal grey goes with all colors. nice addition to tight  patterned pants & boots. dress up or casual
1,I'm happy to say i got this on the sale rack but had been eyeing this long before.  it is a flattering fit on me in size large.  i just love the colors in the print!  also  the style is not a basic shell but a very feminine cut.  the skinny straps are also a very nice touch.  i plan on wearing this with my long white linen skirt  denim capris or with shorts.  i think i will also opt for a solid cardi or scarf.  this is just so pretty!
-1,Was excited to wear the dress for the first time. but while standing in front of the mirror putting makeup on  the seam between the body and sleeve just started to unravel. strangest thing - just a random hole appeared :(.
0,I love this sweater  so why a lower rating? while i love the material and the color  it lost all of its shape before i even left the house! i am a size 6 / small and it looked clownish on me before i ever got to my dinner party.  i plan to wash it this evening and i really hope that this brings it back to its original shape and keeps it.
-1,This tunic looks awesome in the picture. however  it is made of an uncomfortable sweater-like material not left of centers normal skin cotton. i was disappointed once i saw this in person. not a great material for summer.
-1,I saw this dress in the catalog and immediately ran to the store to purchase. then i realized the dress in the catalog is slightly different  but the small differences is what makes the catalog dress so much more unique and worth the money! look at the top  the stripe colors are different. and the stripes flow different on the skirt part as well. and the dress was short on me and i'm two inches shorter than the model. bummer.
-1,Material is awful. not soft at all. colors are much darker than shows online. it is actually very short not at all as it looks on the model. it went back.
0,I tried this dress on in the store today  and the armholes were so wide  it showed my bra under the arm almost to the bottom  and it showed part of the side cup of my bra at the front. while the dress seems like it will be really comfy  the arm cuts are so unnatural  i had to pass. i did try going down in size  and petite  and neither of those options worked to fix the situation.
-1,The top looks better on the model than in-person. it fits loose and looks boxy and matronly. i don't like the sleeve length or the top style  it just didn't look flattering or good. i am sending it back. looks very boxy.
0,This silk skirt was not the best look for me  but may work for others. i purchased the med  which fit fine. i just wasn't in love with the print/colors. the skirt has quality material and is well made. it's very light and airy. i did return it.
1,These cords are a great  skinny fit.  they seem true to size for me and look great on.  only issue i would have is the color says navy  but they are more of a deep purple-ish color.  i had to recheck my order because they definitely aren't navy....but i'm keeping them because the fit is awesome.
0,I was searching for the perfect large comfy sweater for the cold winter weather ahead and i thought this would be it. it looks so cute in the pictures but when i received in by mail it wasn't what i was searching for. this sweater  like on the model  is quite large. although i wanted a large sweater  the fit of this one didn't fit well on me. it has more of a boxy feel to it. i usually wear a medium  but went with a small because i expected this to fit a little large and it still engulfed me. i
1,Love the lightweight fabric! looks great with skinny jeans. it is flowy  but flattering.  wearing it on my shoulders for work -
1,I treated myself to get this at full-price at the start of summer. my size is xl and it fits me like the model photos. i have gotten such good use out of this blouse. it washes well without shrinking. it's vintage-looking. so comfortable. i love the arm coverage  interesting neckline that covers bra straps  good length. the cami it came with is flimsy so i threw it away. i use another tank underneath. i'd love any of the colors. the blus was more my color but all of them are gorgeous because of
0,"As other reviewers have noted  this is a pretty top. i really love the design. alas  however  it is too big for my frame. for reference i am barely 5'1"" and about 105 lbs. i ordered my usual xxsp and the fit is just not flattering on me. it is looser than on the model and the flounce does not hit me in the proper place. the top is also too wide so that it has these odd gaps near the armpits. i highly recommend this top unless you are an xxsp. i am going to have to part with it  sadly."
1,I love this jacket. it's easy to dress up or be casual. the black is more like a very dark grey.
0,"This skirt material and quality is top notch. i'm not a ""mustard yellow"" fan but the color combo in this is just stunning! i'm 5'4""  125#  27/4 usually and picked a 4 in this which would have been correct. the top bad is very thick so it was just too much at my waist. in the modeling pick she is covering about half the band with her tied tank top. this would look beautiful on anyone approx 5'6"" or over i think! oh  and the drape is beautiful  not super full."
0,I normally get a small in this style shirt but it didn't fit at all so i had to send it back. too bad
1,I feel so lucky to have caught this as a popback--this dress is killer! it's casual style and simple design can be found at other retailers  but the quality and details and fit can only be made by retailer and dolan. it's body skimming but lined so it doesn't cling to flaws  the knit itself is substantial and it's a mockneck  not a turtleneck. i would say this dress runs small because i usually buy medium and this fit in a large. because of weight and lining  this is a spring and early fall dress
0,This top is very nice. good quality  good design. it just doesn't fit me well. i have a large chest and this is a tad fitted at the top  especially around my shoulders  while the lower half fits due to the pleats. the fit seems inconsistent at the top and bottom. i am full-figured  perhaps it would fit a leaner person better.
0,Slouchy relaxed fit. well sewn together and hangs well on the body. bottom hem hits upper thigh. good length and soft  easy fabric. light layering option as well. good spring jacket  can be kept on indoors without getting too hot.
-1,I was so excited to order this sweater but was so disappointed when it came. the knit is somewhat stiff and the sleeves are not as bell shaped as pictured on the model. overall i would of kept it if it were much less money  for the price it is just an ordinary sweater with no style.
-1,I ordered this online  and took it back the day i got it. i could not fit the neck hole over my head  therefore i couldn't even see how it truly fit. i had high hopes for this dress.
1,Beautiful lace shell! great with jeans for a night out  or with a skirt for a more formal affair. good quality  not itchy.
1,I love this t-shirt  i wish it came in tons of other prints! very soft  almost feels lived in  and high quality all the same.
-1,Love the color and overall design of this dress...but it's just going to have to go back. the view from the direct front and back are nice  but froth side the high waist and secure back make me look pregnant. not the look i'm going for especially at this price.    the other oddity is that the white circle design is unfortunately placed! in the back it's all i see which is 'right' on a bulls-eye and the same on the front. i don't know how the designer missed this! it's the only white design on th
-1,I loved the design of this blouse and ordered it the first day it was available. unfortunately  i was disappointed on arrival. besides being more muted color-wise  the sizing is way off. i ordered the xxsp and it was huge on me. on the model  it looks like it skims the body  when in reality  it falls like a tent. i tried tucking it into a skirt  but there was just too much fabric.    though the neck worked for me  i can see how it might be too small for some people as it is very narrow. also  it
0,The top looks like an oversized shirt in the model photo but as you can see it's not at all in person. made with what feels like hospital scrubs-meets-crisp-poplin  this shirt is stiff and does not lay flat against the body. the cut is almost triangular or bell shaped causing it to jut out - think of a flared wide leg pant - but as a shirt. the sleeves have a similar cut as well. i  too  am a 34c and found it made me look much wider as your bust will cause the shirt to move away from you. it's s
-1,"This dress looked great on the hanger  but once on  it did absolutely nothing for me.    navy is one of my most flattering colors  but the navy in the dress did not make up for the yucky second color that was so blah it just reminded me of dirt. that second color made me look drab.    i am 5'8"" with a long torso and wear a size 12 in tts tops and dresses  but the waist on this dress hit at an uncomfortable spot between by waist and ribs. i really needed the waist to be dropped further. or higher"
1,This sweater fits perfect and the pink trim makes it stunning! i was pleasantly surprised when i tried this on. i don't usually pay this much for a cardigan  but the quality and feel are better than usual.
1,I saw this shirt in store a while ago  but could not believe the price and was not about to spend my money on it. however  when it went on sale and there was an extra 40%  i decided to get it. i like the top  it's cute and fun. however  it does poof out a little in the midline. this top goes great with jeans or shorts  and it is cute  but definitely not worth full price for this.
-1,"I purchased the blue s (140lbs  5'8""  34b) and this was very large and boxy on me. not altogether unflattering but not so flattering that it justifies the price. the blue color is very pretty in person--darker and slightly marled. however  although this sweater is certainly cashmere (and very soft because of it)  it is very thin--to the point that i consider this a ""top"" rather than a ""sweater."" the silk panel in back is pretty but  again  thin and unlined. i think that  even on sale  this is ov"
0,This dress is very beautiful - great fabric and colors - but it looked terrible on me because i have large breasts. i am 32dd and this dress made me look pregnant. if you have the right body type it would be a great breezy summer dress. i'm sad because i can't wear it:(
0,I received this top and loved the pattern. however  i ordered both and s and m  and the bust sizing on this top is very odd. i am a 34c  and the bust area was way too big on both  but if i had sized down to the xs the rest of the suit would be too small. maybe it's just made for busty people? also the supportive material in the bust area goes straight across kind of like a bandeau  so that added to the odd look of the bust. it's still a beautiful pattern  so if you're going to give it a try orde
-1,The product looked more or less as expected  but the fabric felt very cheap. not the quality i would expect from retailer. the shirt is also very short  which did not bother me but is something others should be aware of.
1,I'm 5'8  130 and ordered a small. it fits very nice and it's flattering. my daughter doesn't like it as she thinks it looks like a t-shirt tucked into pants. i get that but it fits nicely and i like the pattern and tapered legs.
-1,I was surprised retailer decided to ship this sweater. the sweater looks like it's falling apart and it is huge. i would not recommend this even at a clearance price.
-1,Loved the open shoulders  but not how large and flowy the rest of it was. i could have worn it 9 months preggo ;)
0,The problem with off the shoulder tops is that the neckline is totally elastisized   therefore upon any movement of your arms the top pops above your shoulders making it go from stylish to matronly . the only elastic should be right at the shoulders   the rest of the neckline should be a simple finished hem. .
0,This sweater dress was incredibly soft  and i loved the button detail down the back. unfortunately  i'm an hourglass figure (32dd with 26'' waist). this sweater did nothing to flatter me. i tried it in 2 different sizes; the ps looked far too big on  but the pxs created an awkward baggy area in my midsection while fitting nicely elsewhere. the petite length was great - i am 5'1 and i would not have wanted it any shorter. wish this was a little more tapered in the waist  because the quality is lo
0,I bought this mostly to wear around the house  so i'll keep it because i got it on a pretty good sale.  that said  this runs really large. the sleeves are really loose  and it doesn't really hang well over my hips  which is a shame. it's very soft and cozy  which is nice  but i don't think i'll leave the house in it often. it also arrived with a hole in the ribbing on the bottom of the front panel. i was able to tie a knot through one of the loops that i think will prevent further unraveling  bu
1,I agree with everything the other reviewer stated. this top is very billowy and runs large  it would be nice if i didn't have a chest! the other issue with this top is the macrame detailing is made more out of a satin like material and i wanted it to look closer to natural raw fiber. the pink is slightly more pink in person but it's not that far off. had to return.
0,I should have paid more attention to the reviews of this sweater before ordering. although the material looks soft and cozy in the photo  it's very scratchy and uncomfortable. i was also hoping the opening of the collar would be a little wider  which would have been more flattering on me. i never wear turtlenecks of any kind so i took a chance on this. i'm sure others will look fabulous in this sweater and may be happy with it if they don't mind the texture. i'm sending it back.
0,I wanted this top to fit. i ordered a large and was swimming in it. i returned it to the store where they had it in all sizes. i tried on a medium and it was still too big and then a small that fit but i just did not love it. i did not have trouble with it being cut too low. i think it might look best on someone who is straight up and down and not hourglass since it blouses over the waist. this print is soooo pretty!!
-1,The top is nice  good quality  etc.... but how do you keep the 'off the shoulder' off the shoulder? mine keeps inching up until it's just a boring white top with a strange loose neckline.
-1,I just received this dress wadded up in a bag. it is nothing like the colors shown on line. in the picture it appears blue and white. in actuality it is teal and a funky color of beigey pink. the top is see though but it does see have a slip under the skirt. will be sending it back and again remind myself why i shouldn't try to buy a dress on line.
0,Loved the print on this dress  however the fit wasn't for me.  i feel like it exaggerated my belly  and just overall i didn't feel great in it.  the sleeves were also really big.
1,Loose fitting and comfortable without losing its shape.   looks great on. the tie in front adds to the dress.     i love to wear with tan knee-high boots.
1,This cardigan is a beautiful - not too thin  but soft and versatile. the cutouts add a nice unique detail. i was worried that the cuts might fray  but they actually have a very thin bit of glue to prevent fraying. really beautiful piece for those of us with cold summer offices :)
0,"The fit is definitely more ""straight-leg "" and not skinny  as the photos seem to imply. at 4'11"" and 95 lbs  the size 25 fit my waist and butt wonderfully  and the length was great  but the jean lost shape at the knee. i would recommend these jeans if you are not seeking a skinny fit!"
1,This fit me perfectly with a little room but think it's meant to be this way so easier to get on and off. this feels like a dream and is very good quality. definitely a heavier piece but i like that. it is so very flattering and drapes beautifully to hide my tummy. the back is adorable too! retailer hit it out of park with this one! grab it before it's too late! i'm a 36ddd and size 14 and the large fit perfectly
1,Can't say about fit just yet since it is a gift; color is soft green and versatile. finishing touches around edges and in back make it a stand out sweater that dresses up jeans but also nice over a dress or with skirt
-1,I assumed at the price point this would be a high quality t-shirt/sweater. unfortunately  it is made of cheap looking material that is 50% acrylic and see-through.
-1,"This is a rare review for me  i usually love my retailer purchases  even at times when other reviewers aren't fans  but this top is terrible. 5'4"" 103  32 b for reference  small frame  athletic  bought the xs in black. the length could have been longer  but i could have lived with the length. the arm hole area  however  a different story. because it's boxy  and the fabric is stiffer bc of the large flowers  the top sticks out on the sides under the arm holes leaving a gape  it did not fit snuggly"
1,"I slightly balked at the cost  but i am completely satisfied and glowing about the product  and it is made in the usa. in these times  that means a lot. 100% supima cotton and the perfect design with reasonable deep v-neck  front and back and the slightly lengthened sides  very ultimate design for a tee. i bought the dark grey; the tag says ""wash before wearing""  which is one extra step... still  i find this supima cotton tee pretty much divine. i bought the dark grey in medium  my usual ( size"
-1,This top arrived today  and after trying it on  i wanted to leave a review to say that the shirt is 100% without a doubt pinned back on the model in the product picture. the fit is designed to be loose  so i don't think anyone could possibly get the same look as the model even if they sized down. i've included a picture of how it fits naturally  and a picture of how it fits the model as i hold the fabric back. it's still a cute shirt  just not the flattering top i was expecting. i'm debating on
-1,Similar to others here  these pants were ruined after one wash. the first pair i bought simply faded after one wash  which was okay  but the second pair got weird splotches on the backside. i'd rather not call attention to that particular area of my body;) could've been a great addition to my wardrobe if they were better quality.
1,I am petite and so ordered this top in a petite size and found that it ran large. i am also pretty busty to boot  but found there was more than enough room. the length was still a bit long for me  however it does hit on my where it does on the model. the top is wonderful quality  thick and not see through at all. i am almost tempted to get a regular size and try to wear it as a dress.
-1,There's a reason the model is holding her arms up in all the frontal views. it hides the very weird wide top part of the sleeve that absolutely destroys and distorts an otherwise beautiful blouse. the print is lovely but the fit is very odd. it's pulls at and is very tight through the bust too. i wear medium or large and ordered size large. if you're less well endowed this might be an okay choice for you. but i have to say this blouse made me look overweight and very wide. returned.
-1,I ordered this blouse because it was such a good price on sale but should have paid closer attention to the reviews. the slits on the sleeves are much more noticeable than in the photo and the blouse just didn't work for me. something about it reminded me of seinfeld's pirate shirt. i appreciate retailer's return policy. i took it back to the store and got an immediate refund on my cc.
1,These jeans! i am obsessed. the perfect boyfriend fit with an easy  relaxed feel. i feel instantly cooler when i slip into these. do yourself a favor and buy them!!
0,Super cute top! thin!! would look great layered! not crazy how it looked by itself!
0,I bought these pants in white and tan. they are comfortable and fit great.however  they tend to stretch. i just got them and they are already starting to become uncomfortably loose. i still really like them but i recommend you buy a little tight so they become comfortable.
0,"There is no back zip on this skirt and therefore it does not lay flat as it would if there were a zip. instead it has an elastic waist. it is very nice quality but i never would have purchased this skirt if i knew it had an elastic waist. i am 5'6"" and a size 6. it runs a bit large - i think this is due to the elastic waste."
0,"This dress is very cute! i loved it. the quality is excellent. however  the fit is off. i'm 5""1  107lbs  32c. this dress was roomy in the bust and was a little too broad shouldered. it was tight around the waist. this caused creasing and buldging in the back. the color is much more vibrant in person. i would have kept it  if it fit properly."
1,I saw this tee and was unsure about the print  but decided to give it a try. i'm glad i did  as it has become a weekend staple.
0,Picked this up in the store today  but didn't try it on first. it is even more gorgeous in person than the photo  but sadly this did not work for me when i got it home to try on. there is wonderful detailing  but somehow the bulky knit fit was just not flattering on. i think it is the thick knit and slightly shorter length. the knit was bulking up in all the wrong places and visually added about 10l bs to my frame. such a shame---really wanted to keep this beautiful sweater but it just did not l
-1,The print is very pretty but the fabric is stiff and it runs way too big.  looks great on the model but awful on me.
1,I love the way this fits and feels on. it is a beautiful piece and makes me happy to wear. i ordered my usual size medium and it fits well. the only con is that it is dry clean only.
-1,I love this shirt  love love love it. i am a curvy girl and it accents all the right features and hides the ones that need to be hidden. but i've owned it for 6 months and there are already 4 holes in the shirt. and not holes in the fabric but holes on the seam lines. the stitching is not sturdy enough for the shirt to not fall apart. the whole point is to be able to wear it. but now i have to bust out my sewing machine to reinforce the seams that split so that i can wear it again. :(
-1,This dress looks like it could be cute on but when you put it on its just blah. i saw someone else trying it on in the fitting room and she felt the same. not cute  not flattering  the model photo is deceiving. would not recommend  although it looks airy and comfy.
-1,When the top arrived and i tried it on; it was great. the length was perfect even though i am curvy. after one wash (done according to the directions)  the top shrank in length considerably. i do not mind paying a higher price for something unique and something of quality.....i do have a problem with something that does not hold up to basic use. i will be returning this item.
-1,After reading all the reviews and sizing down one size. i got my top size m  i usually wear m/l depending on the style. i'm 6 ft tall  160 lb  i like my clothing loose but not as loose as this top. i should have gone to xxxxxs if such exists. no wonder there is such a low leap in price. it is a good quality though  and very nice pale peach color. no would not recommend  unless you wear 3xxxl
1,It is a perfect weight and length. it's a great dress. i did need to have the waist altered bc it is a straight fit.
0,I love the look and feel of  this easy dress. i loved that it comes with a baby blue slip  however i was in between sizes. the medium - a bit too small and the large- just too big. this dress is probably best in a tall thin body type  especially in a madras plaid.
0,I loved how the skirt looked on the model  but when i tried in on it had no shape on me. i usually wear a size 6 and received a size 4 which was large on me. also  the material feels rough which i was not expecting as it is advertised as a silk skirt. i was really looking forward to wearing this skirt but it is just not i thought it was - i expect better quality from retailer.
0,I wanted to love this dress but the sizing was too large for me  overwhelming my frame. i am very petite; for reference  5'2  24 waist  30  and usually get an xxsp or 00p but even the 00p was too large in both the waist and especially in the shoulder area. at minimum for fit  i would have had to have the dress taken up but required too much alteration. the skirt is not lined which i found disappointing  given the price. the colors and handkerchief like hem is really cute though but i returned.
1,It is a little boxy  but it?s not unflattering in my opinion. the sweatshirt material is soft  the ruffles keep their shape and position  and aren?t too overwhelming on my small frame. i like the small slits on the sides  they allow the sweater to drape nicely. it also hit at a flattering spot  a little below the hip. 5?1??  100 lbs  and got the xxs petite. this fit true to size for me.
1,I love this! i will sport it in the spring with white capris/ leggings and awesome for a beach cover-up! the fit is comfy the embroidery gives it a feminine touch. i purchased the large but could've gotten away with a slender fit in medium. i am 5'4 170 lbs.
1,I highly recommend this dress!!!!!! i was a little nervous about purchasing this dress online because previous reviewers were saying that it creates static  but nothing that a little static guard couldn't prevent! :) i purchased a medium petite and i am about 5 feet tall  usually a size 8 in dresses and it fit perfect! (wore for thanksgiving) the fabric and style are very forgiving and the dress sort of flows with you when you walk  which i love!!
1,The sweater is as cute in person as it is online.
0,Love the print and comfort of this tank  however  it does run about 2 sizes larger than normal. it is also not a fitted tank  it has some flow which is not exactly what i was looking for.
1,This top is really pretty & i think i will be happy when i pull it out in the spring to wear it. the only complaint is that the front is very sheer. you have to wear an under shirt of some kind.
1,Love the design (i got the blue and green one). it was more see-through than i thought but the pattern covers it so it doesn't matter what color bra you wear.
1,This dress is really pretty  but not made for girls with hips. i tried on my usual size 6 and it fit everywhere but was just slightly too tight in the bum for me to feel comfortable  but i feel like i would have been swimming everywhere else in the dress in an 8 (typical of shifts i guess  but a girls can dream!). if you are a straighter shape  though  i would highly recommend.
0,You guys  i love this so much! however  within one hour of wearing it  the back seam completely ripped. it fit me perfectly... sadly i&#39;ll have to return the damaged item. really sad it&#39;s all sold out too!
-1,I wanted to love this dress. i ordered online and what you cannot see in the picture if the pleating on the dress. i ordered a medium  i am usually a large in retailer and the medium looked like a tent. i realize this should be loose fitting but it was huge.
0,I liked this top but found it to be a little dowdy. fit was slightly boxy and not a good look for me. may look better on a different body type.
1,Love this sweater! not too long or bulky true to size. the fabric is super soft  great quality!
-1,I wanted to love this so much that i ordered in both a mp and sp. both have gone back. i'm petite and curvy - particularly on top. i wear petites 90% of the time. this didn't fit like a petite - it was cut like full size in every way - particularly the arm holes and length. when the mp didn't fit (i always start trying on in the larger size)  i thought - well surely the small will be better. i considered keeping because i would wear it with jackets over it  then decided that was crazy. disappoin
0,Loved the pattern and colors of this dress. the material was extremely heavy. the shoulders and across the back was very small so that i couldn't lift my arms or put them out straight in front of me. but then the rest of the dress was huge and shapeless. sadly i had to return it.
1,This dress is so much prettier in person - the pattern is unique  adorable and not over-powering. i'm an xxs petite and i can wear the dress with flats. (5ft) i think this is versatile enough to wear to work  party or a casual wedding. the fit is perfect - hugs at the correct spots. the fabric feels really soft and silky and feels a bit heavy which allows it to drape nicely. overall - i love it.
1,I have no idea why this has bad reviews! how is there any left?! this is a beautiful piece that i had to have in both the navy and green. i love that it comes with a cami. it&#39;s very flattering and not too wide or boxy. the lace detail is amazing! i bought my usual size and it fits perfect. love this top!!
-1,"When i ordered this dress  i thought to myself ""hmm  it seems a little close to showing some side boob  but maybe that's just the angle of the photo."" flash forward to me trying it on in my home - ""yep  that's some side boob."" it is very low cut under the arms. if you're super slim  this might be a good look  but on a curvy gal with some boobs  it was obscene. also  i'm a solid 12 in most retailer brands  so i ordered a l and an xl just in case. the xl wouldn't even zip up. returning."
-1,"I so wanted to love this tank  and was so excited to get it in the mail! i got a size small (my usual) and it ran so large i wasn't even sure an xs would've fit properly. the material looked lighter and blouse-y on the model  but in person is much thicker and sort of ""hangs"". underarms run large and are gaping from the body. i am sad to return this top because i love the color and idea of it  but it just can't work on me!"
1,I am a little retailer obsessed and have a lot of clothing from here....this has to be the best thing i've ever purchased. it is so soft and beautiful. i am 5'11 and 150lbs and got the m/l ...fits perfectly and doesn't swallow me up but it does hide my bottom and the sides come up but not to wear my side stomach is showing. it does sit at an angle on the body but to me that's so perfect  a little different and not a defect. it is not itchy whats so ever. i love this with skinny jeans and brown boo
1,This dress is beautiful. it was on back order and i waited about three weeks to receive it. i usually wear a size 8 in retailer but because it was a button down dress  i ordered a size 10. the bottom is a great fit but the top is difficult to button. it is a heavier weight so i feel it is better for the spring than the summer season.
-1,I was so excited for this dress to come. i am 5&#39;1&quot; and 100lbs so i ordered and xs petite. it was literally falling down around my shoulders and gigantic all around. maybe on someone taller this would have looked great. i was also disappointed that the blue shown online was not accurate. my dress was a much lighter blue. back to the store it goes.
0,It broke my heart to return this shirt. the pattern is just the kind of quirky that i crave from retailer. the quality is really great but in the end this shirt was just way to big. i don't think the xs would have made enough of a difference. sad face.
-1,I was attracted to the feminine design of the dress  the silhouette  the flouncy skirt; however  i ordered the red motif pattern and hated the splotchy  dark colors.
0,This top is lovely  but fits like a crop top -- and i'm very short-waisted. i wore it with high-waisted jeans and was tugging at it all day. i think it will probably work better with a skirt. the colors are beautiful; it has a nice retro vibe. recommended if you don't mind the crop factor.
0,I thought this dress was very cute on the model  however it was way too tight across the chest for me. going up a size would mean it would be too roomy everywhere else. also  fabric wasn't great.
0,A pretty blouse but the polyester fabric makes it incredibly warm and uncomfortable on after a while. had to return it.
1,I like the soft green color  the chino fabric and the casual vibe this dress exudes. perfect for spring and early summer. runs tts but may be snug for bustier gals. wish this had pockets.
0,I followed the advice of other reviewers and sized down. however  the jacket was still too large. it fit fine in the arms but the body/width of the jacket was huge. also i found the wool material to be extremely itchy. it might work if you are layering it over long sleeves but still make sure to size down at least one or maybe even two sizes.
1,Love the pattern  i thought i would be hosed and need a petite  but the regular xs fits nicely. it is on the thiner side  so great for summer (office is cooold)  love subtle squares  glad they still had my size at sale! :-)
0,Material and color is nice.  the leg opening is very large.  i am 5'1 (100#) and the length hits me right above my ankle.  with a leg opening the size of my waist and hem line above my ankle  and front pleats to make me fluffy  i think you can imagine that it is not a flattering look.  if you are at least average height or taller  this may look good on you.
1,I am 5'3  120 lbs and i got xs petite. it fits beautifully and hits me a couple inches above my ankle bone. as stated in my review title  the material is quite heavy and great quality  which helps it hang nicely. cut high enough under the armholes and snug enough under the arms and across the top of my chest so the fullness at the bottom is proportional. love it with my lace-up espadrilles!
1,Really cute top  comfy  with just enough flare that it can be dressed up a bit  or worn just casual. not clingy at all...in fact  maybe just a tad too flowy around the middle  but not so much that it kept me from going back to buy it immediately in a second color! i typically wear a large  but suspect the arms on the medium might be a tad small if i sized down.
1,This product i better than the pic. nice fit and a nice throw on with boots nap glad i took a chance one it
0,The fabric is great quality but it stretches too much around the waist making it look a little awkward. other than that the quality is good.
-1,This dress is beautiful and unique - the cutouts and lace really stand out. however  the dress was huge on me and that is rare with moulinette souers. i usually get a 0 or 0p in this brand due to the bust sizing being generally smaller but the 0 regular was huge and the armholes really big. the petite may have been better but felt that it would have been too short. while the design is beautiful  there were several areas on the dress where the threads were unraveling. for reference  i am 24 waist
-1,This is so thin and poor quality. especially for the price. it felt like a thin pajama top. the buttons are terrible little shell buttons. this could not have been returned faster.
-1,I thought this dress looked gorgeous on the model. so floaty and light. when it came  i found it to be the exact opposite. the hem is so heavy and laid on me like a potato sack. it had way too much material at the bottom and weighed me down unfortunately.
1,Fit and flare  pullover style that can easily be dressed up or down. wish other colors were available online!
1,I was very hesitant about this. i read the previous reviews and thought oh no. the first time i saw it in person i was mildly disappointed because the material wasn't how i thought it would be. then i saw it up close  and i realized it was better than i thought. however  i didn't have time to try it on.    it wasn't until later when i saw it on someone else that i realized i was looking at a must have. i am so happy i purchased this. its beautiful and flattering and the colors are bright yet und
0,Let me start this review by saying  75% of my clothing is from retailer and i love them. my husband bought this sweater for me recently and it's gorgeous  but when i tried it on one sleeve was longer than the other. i went to the store and tried on several sweaters even in different colors and had the same issue. sometimes is was extreme  sometimes is wasn't as noticeable. it was noticeable to me  however  as i am 6' and sleeve length is super obvious when its too short. love the sweater  as it wa
0,But-the problem is i cannot get the color to stay below the shoulders. the large appeal of this top is the over the shoulder look-but in just trying it on it would pop off the shoulders and make a cowl neck kind of top that didn't lay right. if it would have stayed it would have been a real win for me. i like the quality of the fabric and the longs sleeves  but i can't get the desired look to work out so this is going back.
0,I loved the idea of this dress  but i find that it isn't very flattering. i think the arm holes are actually very interesting  but i'm 5'5 and 135lbs  and the dress made me look fat and gave me no shape at all. maybe it would look better on a different body type.  the material is soft  but a bit stuffy and i could tell it would give me crazy static in my hair.
-1,It's pretty  floaty  feminine; the photos don't do justice to the prettiness. but the photos also don't show an asymmetrical hem. i understood it runs small so i got two sizes  to be safe  and even my larger size was strangely short-waisted  and i'm short-waisted to start with. maybe i could've lived with that  but both the dresses i received have an uneven hem unlike any i've ever worn or seen before. it's not longer on just the sides; the hem is longer in one spot on the front  and one in the
-1,I was bummed about this top. detail on back is pretty  even so  not worth it. i'm usually an xs i'm  120 lbs and it fit true to size. guess i had higher expectations. i'm feel consistently let down with what the pictures convey and the actual item when it arrives in person...
1,Fits a bit on the bigger side  but also being the style of the top. i would order down a bit. i'm usually a 4 on top( 34c) and the xs was perfect. the wine color is classy. it's a timeless piece...
1,I bought the lavender in my normal large. the fabric drapes wonderfully and does not cling to my midsection. the texture of the fabric is much more interesting than the photos online show. there is beautiful shimmer tot he heather in the color. in my lavender shirt there is pink/gray/lavendar/white/silver depth to the fabric. i plan on getting at least two more colors.     i recommend washing all shirts like this in a nylon bag in the machine  then line drying. i have done this for years with al
1,I tried on a regular size at the store  and definitely need petite (5'1.5'  115 lbs). the dress is comfrotbale  and the ivory color gives it a victorian feel. the sleeves are nice a cover the shoulder in a flattrering spot  where hte muscles meet. there is alining  so not see-through. length was too long  why i need petie  also loose-fitting  i would like it more a little more fitted  jsut a bit.
-1,"I'm 5' 5""  150 lbs  32dd  normally a 28p or 29p in pants. i ordered an 8 and probably should have gone with a 10. it was super unflattering?the print was overwhelming for my pale skin  it made my thin waist look larger than it really was  and rode up the inside of my thighs. i have a similar bathing suit from modcloth that's 1/3 of the price and 20x as flattering. if you have thick legs  this may not be the suit for you. i returned it--so fast."
-1,"I think this will work well on very busty hourglass figures or very petite frames; but on my athletic build this shirt did me no favors. i have one of those body types where my biceps are very muscular  and my shoulders are broader than my hips (w/a 34b chest). i typically take a m or a l in most retailer tops  and  had i kept this  i would have gone with the m. ---------- this shirt hit my arm at the low point of my bicep (~1"" above my elbow) and made my arms look huge. fyi  the v neck is very de"
0,I love this sweater so much and wanted it to be my new favorite  but unfortunately it was a bit short for my longer torso. when i raised my arms up  it bunched up all wrong because it's a very thick sweater.
0,I ordered this in black and white  thinking you can never have enough silk camisoles.     i returned the black because it looked like polyester. the white is actually a cream/ivory  not bright white as pictured. it is also not the best feeling quality  however the fit is good  and true to size.
0,I ordered this in tan and white  but ended up returning it. the material is a bit thin (but soft). the shape of the top was decent  i didn't think it was too boxy but i didn't like how the seams looked on the sides. ultimately i didn't think it was worth the price.
1,The embroidery is breathtaking. it is more flattering and interesting in person. i would highly recommend it!. it is true to size  figure flattering  and unique. the only reason i gave it four stars for quality is because the neck is a little itchy. if you are looking for a show stopper and conversation piece  this is it!
0,"I buy pretty much every tiny top retailer carries and so of course i grabbed this one online. i would say size wise it's consistent for tiny  which in my opinion is in the ""runs small"" category as i'm a large in basically every top ever except the tiiny brand where i always have to take an xl. anyway  the print is beautiful but the neckline is strange- there is a very flimsy button keeping it tacked shut at the very top  and if that snap pops open it's open all the way down to the waist area where"
1,I really like these but my usual size 29 did not fit. i always wear that size in pilcro but these were at least a size two small and i have to return them. regretfully  they are out of size 30 so i lose out. wish there had been previous reviews to let me know  so i'm doing so now for anyone thinking of ordering.
1,I ordered this cutie before i read any reviews and i am so glad i did. mine does not have any weird smell at all. i ordered a medium and i wear a size 8. it fits perfectly and is long enough to wear with leggings ...with coverage. the detailing on the yoke is so pretty. i bought it with a discount promotion so it made the price better. i am really glad to add it to my wardrobe!!
0,"I was really excited to receive this dress but was disappointed that it really wasn't that special. i'm 134 lbs  5'5"" and i ordered a regular size s and it did fit. i prefer my dresses right above my knees but this was probably 2 inches above the knees. it just wasn't that flattering nor worth the price. i expected to be wowed but wasn't!"
0,I was disappointed by this dress. i listened to the reviews and ordered one size up  a size 6 instead of my usual 4  and that was the correct size. fit like a glove. unfortunately  the style left much to be desired. this dress is very costume-y. i felt like a wench from the renaissance fair. not a good vibe. it is a beautiful dress  i'm not denying that  but not as a dress you would actually wear to an event. there's just too much going on with the tapestry look and the many types of fabric. i a
-1,This top is a good concept but the structure of it is not for all body types. i am 5.6 and 135 and wear an xs to a s in retailer tops and i ordered this is a small and it was huge in the chest and tight at my hips...will be returning.
-1,I am of average height  but these pants are so long!! i considered altering them because i like the print  but i don't think it's worth the effort for workout attire so they're going back. shame!!
0,"This shirt is not awful but not anything pretty. there's a reason the main photo has the model with her arms crossed over the waist! it runs good on top and then you get to the body of the garment and it runs straight down yet the pleats even make it manage to expand a little but then you get to the lovely detailed hem which reins them in. so now you are left with a bit of a poof effect making you rounder in all the wrong ways. it's one of those  ""i'm too lazy to send it back it's not that awful"
-1,I had such high hopes  but they are just slightly off. they run a tad large  so i suggest sizing down. (i usually wear a 28 or 29  and the 28 fit nicely through the hips and thighs.)  unfortunately  the color is off- i thought they were going to be a dark midnight blue  but they are actually gray. and they have a button-fly closure which causes the pants to protrude a bit in the area where no woman wants protrusion. i will be returning them.
1,As soon as i saw this online i knew i'd love it  and when it arrived in my store i scooped it up right away!!! the poncho is exactly as it appears online. the color is different variations of gray. the fabric is soft and not itchy at all. it's longer in back  has arm holes on either side and lays beautifully. it's long enough to wear with leggings  but looks clean enough to pair with jeans and a top. this is light enough for cool summer nights  but will be my fall go to once the cold weather com
0,"I like the feel and color of this blouse. however  i was very disappointed with the sizing. i usually wear medium so i ordered medium for this blouse  it fits way too big. it is a bummer because the ""curve"" is not even visible when i wear it."
-1,This was completely different than i expected. the xs/s was so large that it looked messy. unfortunately i had to return it.
-1,I love anything orange- when i saw this coat online  i ordered it as i loved all the features. the features of the coat are fun- however the coat came all bunched up in the package. i let it hang for a couple of days but the wrinkles were awful and even steaming and an iron would not take the creases away. i tried the coat on - the buckles were poorly made. i ended up returning this jacket.
-1,I finally ordered a pair of these jeans after seeing so many rave reviews  and when they went on sale. i'm leaving this review for women who share my body type.    i'm slim with longer legs  and don't really have curves. i typically don't purchase jeans with an inseam shorter than 30''. for reference  i really love the fit of paige and m.i.h. jeans.    these jeans have an inseam of 31''  which i thought would be fine. but for me  the cut wasn't flattering at all. i typically look for jeans that
1,This skirt is gorgeous- the picture doesn't do it justice. it has beautiful sparkle and glitter in the material. i received tons of compliments on it. the biggest downside is the material- it seems to snag and pull so easily. in a short 2 hours of wearing it  the material was already pulled in two different places. i will keep the skirt because it is so pretty but have to not get upset when the material gets worse over time.
1,I love the color and shimmer of this dress. it is very unique and one of a kind. the slit is not as high as the photo online but that can be adjusted if need be at a tailor. it's a great dress!
-1,This sweater i bought to go with a navy dress. it is not ivory. it is sortof a blush color???? not at all what i had in mind. the sweater itself is pretty. the back is shorter as someone else described which looks slightly awkward when wearing it. definite return. :(
-1,I loved the cut and style of this shirt  so was very disappointed when i put it on and it was very tight and slightly see-through. if you do order it  get it in a size larger.
0,This dress is adorable. the color is on the red orange side and is nice for the summer. the cotton is also nice and light. however  the bust is cut short and the skirt is unforgiving to girls with hips. if you have b/c cup or less and do not have an hour glass figure then this dress may be for you.
0,I liked that this was a unique take on a sweatshirt. pretty seam down the back and weight of material. i'm going to return it because i wish it was a little more of a loose/baggy fit and under-pattern is darker than i thought.
1,I ordered the white in this. i found it to be so much prettier in person than the photos. i don't think they do this piece justice. i am normally a medium and that is what i ordered. i found it fit true to size. love the three ties in the back. it's a tad baggy  but looks great. i can see that this might snag easily though.
0,Loved these pants when i tried them on they looked great and felt so comfortable. when i washed according to the directions on the tag the bottom of one leg lost so much color that i can't wear them anymore..so disappointed!
0,"Got them in the light blue. i'm 5'0"" so they're a little long. i like the texture and they are really comfortable! the only thing is the awkward seams around the crotch area so you really can't wear them alone with a cropped tee or shorter top."
1,Wonderful sweater and fashionable for autumn. the only thing i do not like about the sweater is that it sheds very bad. bring a lint roller with you when you wear the sweater!
-1,I wanted to love this top. but  it looks like an ambitious 12 year old made it with rumpled fabric and lace found in her grandmothers attic. re: hopeful  but not good. the quality is not good and it hangs strangely on. sadly it is going back.
0,I love the simplicity and modernity of this tunic; however  the pockets ruin it  if that's possible. they make the dress bulky around the hips. i usually wear an 8 or medium and i ordered this dress in a medium. i think this brand runs a little small. the bulky pocket issue may be solved with a larger size. the weight of the fabric is a little heavy which prevents year-round wear. i love the subtle texture. one odd thing  the tag is attached to the stand-up collar. i had my hair up when i tried
-1,I typically wear a size 16/xl in anything from retailer and i ordered this top in an xl. it's more of a t-shirt with buttons than a blouse and it was overall too huge. it's nice to have extended size options but even if i went down to a size l  this would have looked like a maternity top on me.
1,"I really love this shirt. the cutouts make it unique and the fabric is super soft for a chambray style. i thought the fit was perfect - i'm 5'5""  120lbs and i ordered an xs. still enough room to be comfortable. super cute! glad i bought it."
-1,... for the model to look like this? pros: nice quality. the colors of the blue version  at least  are rich and beautiful. note that the dark color pictured is really brown  not black. the colors are also much brighter than they appear in the picture. it is a medium to heavy weight sweater knit which is well suited for fall-winter. it is layered over a bright navy poly slip. cons: i am 5'8 135# . i looked like i was wearing a circus tent in med. the sleeves were more dolman than fitted. i imagin
1,Im normally an xs and i bought size 2 and it fit great. very slimming and looks great with white capris.
-1,I am very disappointed with this order. the shirt looks and feels cheap  is not flattering in any way. i am sending it back right away.
0,I like the tunic but there are no care instructions in the garment. if i wash it once and it shrinks or the dye runs it will be going back. please send care instructions.
1,I saw this online and then at the retailer store where i was able to try it on and was happily surprised.yes it is way oversized but if you size down it will work best. i have narrow hips and shoulders but a 34 dd bust  so fit is not always easy. because of my shape i normally wear a medium or small but had to size down to an xs petite in this. you may find  as i did  that it works dressed up or down. if i had bought a regular size  and were lots younger  it could have worked for a dress with tigh
0,I ordered this quite nice cardigan. i received the sweater promptly (yay fast shipping!) but never received the belt to it. i tried emailing about it  but didn't get a response. the sweater really is the softest thing ever but it will not close without the belt and trying to use a different belt just doesn't work. i hope to receive the belt soon  because i'd really like to wear this a lot this winter.
-1,This is one of the lowest quality shirts i have ever received from retailer. i was so excited for the shirt  it looked so pretty and soft in the pictures. the flax is very scratchy  marring the softness of the rest of the fabric. the top half is totally sheer  requiring a cami. the shirt is cut in such a way that it flares out from the rib cafe in an unstructured way  unnecessarily adding visual pounds. finally  the sewing is done very poorly and the the side tag is literally three inches long--wh
-1,I really like the look of the top when it is photographed on other people but it just isn't for me. the fabric is stiffer than i would have expected and not very moveable. the fit is not quite right on me. the longer sleeves detract from the look of the shirt. i also generally prefer things a little more form fitting of which this is not. it was not very comfortable for me either  so this was clearly not a win for me.
1,I have had my eye on this dress since the spring (in yellow)  but it sold out quickly. i jumped on this dress as soon as i saw it come out in different colors this fall! i purchased the peach color and it is really lovely. i will be wearing this dress for family photos. the lace and the details are so very pretty! i am usually a size 0 or 2  and purchased in size 2 since there is no stretch to it. it is a beautiful dress and i highly recommend it! wish it came in white!
1,"This tank/blouse is flowy and i love the design. it was immediately comfortable and seemed true to size. i wore it to a family event with a sweater  black leggings and boots. i'm 5'5 "" 36d and usually wear medium in retailer tops and this fit beautifully from the get go  just love it!"
-1,Ordered a l and xl  the sleeves were so tight on both sizes but the rest of the shirt was wide and loose. the tight sleeves were not proportional with the rest of the shirt. both sizes had to be returned.
0,I wanted this dress to work so badly but if you have any chest or any hips this won't work for you. i tried in petites and regular and it just didn't work at all
-1,I agree with the other reviewers that this runs big. unfortunately there is nothing smaller than an xs so this is going back. i love the lyocell material  i have another skirt with this material and wanted to love this as well but it is too big and with the drawstring pulled tight to fit it doesn't look right. it is not as pictured as well. the skirt i received is a medium blue denim  not the lovely light blue as pictured  another reason why i am returning.
0,"I read all reviews and i decided to try as the price was great. first of all i am 5'6"" 145 lbs  athletic build (not skinny but have muscles). the sweater fits great  just like glove  it does not make me look fat. the quality is great sweater is warm  cozy and well-made. i am not sure about color as it's brighter as it shown. it is not quite coral  it's a little bit darker which will make it difficult to match it with. the sleeves run small so if you are taller then me just keep it in mind. th sw"
0,This is a great feminine top i just wish it were a little bit longer for my taste  it hit about two inches below my belly button. it was a little snug around the belly area so that's why i feel it runs small for the brand  usually the brand runs true to size but not for this top
0,"I really wanted this shirt to work -- the fabric is really cool -- but sadly the cut was just way off. i'm 5'10""  and the shirt was much shorter on me than on the model  and the cut was just too wide under the armpits."
1,Pretty top. quality material  it is not thin and see  through. size down because this runs large. although it is meant to be flowy  if you don't size down  the arm holes will show your bra and the rest of the body will have too much fabric looking too boxy and unflattering.
0,I've been looking at this jacket on line and finally went to the store to try it on. i really liked the styling but the denim was quite stiff. i'd prefer a softer kind of fabric. i wonder if it would soften if it was washed. also  it ran surprisingly small. i usually take an xsmall or small but the small didn't leave me enough room to comfortably bend my arms. the medium worked better. i wonder how others feel about the fabric and and the sizing. i think i'll wait and see if this one goes on sal
0,This blazer is a nice weight for summer. it is more terracotta than rose  but is still a nice color. the fit is tts and flattering. however  the buttons were almost falling off the one i received. i didn't take this as a sign of great quality and plan to return it.
1,I love this dress! i bought the blue one and i love the designs. i recently had a baby so my body is still recovering so finding clothes is a bit difficult  but this dress looks awesome and it makes me feel like how i was before i was pregnant! it flows nicely and is super comfortable.
1,I ordered this shirt last week  and i wore it as soon as it arrived. it is a beautiful shirt with an original design. it is rather casual  but you can dress it up with the right accessories. the print appears to be navy (it was advertised as black)  and it looks great with jeans. i would certainly recommend this item.
1,This is my favorite top! it is gorgeous  soft  & oh so comfortable. it's not too tight & works with leggings  jeans  or as an over-shirt. love it!
1,I have two tracy reese skirts from a few years back that i still wear. so i am favorably disposed to this designer's style and quality. this is a slim fitting skirt  though i ordered it in a 6 and my two others are 8s. so i don't agree with previous review that this skirt runs large. it is nicely fitted and flattering. it does not ride up when sitting  which is almost amazing. i wish the pockets laid a bit flatter. also  on my skirt there is no sewn-in fabric or laundering instructions. none! th
1,I paid full price for these gladly (the olive ones) and was delighted when i was able to purchase the black on sale. they are midweight  soft  flattering and stylish. they stretch a little (belt needed) but not much. pilcro are my go-to pants and these hit it out of the park. i wish they would come in a lighter weight version for warmer weather !
-1,I loved these pants the minute i put them on  and was so happy i'd ordered them. but i wore them only 3 times - and only at dinners with friends  not even for full days - and the seams on both legs ripped open! i think the faux leather just isn't equipped to handle the stretch of fitted leggings. i was super-bummed about this  because these pants are so insanely cute. but if they can't hold up to a few casual wears  then there's just no way... thankfully retailer was true to their brilliant custom
-1,I've had a lot of misses from retailer lately. i've loved this dress since i first saw it in the spring/summer releases and gave it a try when it went on sale. when it arrived i literally lol. it's an ill fitting nightgown. the size small was a tent on me and it's so flimsy and sheer it probably shouldn't be worn in public. there's a short sheer slip that comes with it but unfortunately doesn't do much. pass  ladies.
-1,Ordered this dress in an xs  that is the size i usually wear. this runs small  but not only that it is the way it is cut  very small through the hips  thighs and legs. hard to walk in it. the material felt kind of cheap to me. i thought it looked really good on the model  but got it home and didn't like it at all! it went back!
1,I love this top! it fits perfect and is of great quality! i ordered the pink and love it so much i'm getting the navy one! colors are so trendy as well. this top is so much cuter in person. hard to tell the detail online. definitely recommend to others!
1,"The online pictures do not do this dress justice. the materials between the top and skirt are different with the black part being a soft  sweater feel and the bottom part being an appropriately thick knit feel. the contract is stunning and is largely washed out in the online pictures. this is not the kind of dress you see on a rack and think ""oh my gosh  that's the one!"" but if you try it on  you will have this moment. it is comfortable  flattering  and slimming-a prefect everyday dress."
1,Beautiful angel of the north sweater! tts  lovely color and a staple classic.
0,It looks great on the model but not on me. on me  it looked more like a sack of potatoes. the fabric is unexpected for the style in my opinion. it is very thick. i'll be returning it because it is not flattering on me.
0,These run very large.  i wear a 25 or 26 in paige jeans  and the 25 in these shorts were way too big.  i fear if i got the 24 they would be a little short.
-1,I love the colors and style of this poncho  however  the fabric is a total miss.  it is so scratchy  i developed a serious rash within the first 1/2 hour of wering it. also  unfortunately  the fabric is not woven tightly  so the poncho does not keep you warm  the wind whips right through it. it is disappointing that while the styles of retailer have remained top  the quality of their clothing has steadly gone down the hill. i hope retailer will put more effort in bringing the quality back.
-1,This one didn't work for me. there is no zipper  you climb into it from the very large neck hole. it was very low cut and the shoulders kept sliding off but the bottom half fit snug. the tie and waist seam didn't hit at my waist but the largest part of my middle. i tried other belts and it wasn't much better. the fabric and print were great. i love jumpers but this one went back.
1,This is a great dress that i was eyeing for some time. i bought it after new year's with the 40% off discount. unfortunately the dress arrived with a defect so i have to have it fixed.  the quality of the dress is amazing. the details are truly unique. one could tell that the dress is very well made. however  it does run large. i bought the xs and feel that i could have downsized at least one to two sizes! it's very comfortable and it could be dressed up or down.  overall  im happy with the purc
0,Read all the reviews i didn't really understand that it really had real shape wear in the skirt. i live in florida and found the dress to be too confining and hot. i would never get any wear out of it. much better for someone up north. had to return it.
-1,I ordered this dress online. the colors are pretty (if you like pastels) and the fit is true to size  however  it fits very much like a maternity dress. for those of you rocking a baby bump  this is a good choice. for others who are not  it's just not flattering. my figure got lost in the dress and the high waist did not look good on me. i returned it.
-1,I wanted this dress so much  i ordered it twice. both times the zipper was defective--it would get stuck midway up  at the waistline--so i had to send it back (there isn't an retailer in my area). this is a shame because it's got great colors and looks flattering on  and i was looking forward to pairing it with a cardigan/boots for fall. i even thought about taking it to a seamstress to have the zipper replaced  but the cost didn't seem worth it. too bad  as it seems like it would be a nice
0,These are really nice pants - color and style are perfect but when i first put them on they seemed like they fit perfectly on me then within 30 minutes they looked 2 sizes too big - they got loose due to the material not being firm or thick enough. i would go down a size for sure. the cons aren't unsolvable so try them out!
0,Glad i got this on sale. it is more yellow than the photo & short. it is also heavy with a sueded interior. would have given more stars if it was less boxy & longer.
1,Almost perfect! this jacket doesn't have that weird vegan smell. it's soft  smooth  and very high quality. this jacket is also a nice surprise for us busty ladies. i'm a 32ddd and the m fit nicely  no squishing (as the other reviewers have said  the chest has room!).     i got the gray  and i loved it it's soft tint. i returned it because the lower band of the jacket sits right at my widest part of my torso  my post-baby belly. the jacket is sort of short like a peplum  and i want to hide the st
1,Great  flattering fit  lovely light fabric  classy with an edge. getting another one the other color! stripes on the taupe one are navy -
0,I love the style of this top  and the longer length would be great with leggings and fitted shorts. it's somewhat fitted on the top yet it's a-line shape gives a full swing at the bottom. the ruffled v-neckline is pretty  and i like the longer length of the short sleeves. but with all these attributes  unfortunately they cut the armholes really big  so when you put your arms forward  the sleeves pull against your arms. i was trying to decide if i should keep it anyway  but for $98 dollars i thin
1,Great dress - fits tts (i am a 6p and purchased a sp). looks good with boots or ballet flats.
0,Love the colors  love the design  and sure to keep you toasty. im usually a size 0 or 2 so i ordered an extra small- it felt a bit roomie
0,I had high hopes for this top  as it looked great online. unfortunately it was much more ruffly in person and not my style at all. it was a lot of fabric and poofed out too much -- reminded me of a child's top. sad to return it!
-1,I've purchased pilcro jeans in the past and they've held up great. unfortunately  the material used for this particular jean is a far  far cry from what it used to be. the thighs of these jeans start pilling (yes pilling!) after just a few wears. i've never had jeans do this -- whatever denim blend they are using is a complete disaster.    don't buy these -- you will be very disappointed.
-1,The fit of this top is nothing like in the photo. the blouse on the model must be pinned back to achieve that fitted silhouette. in reality this top is baggy and boxy and runs at least one size large. the embroidery  details  and soft material are great  but the fit is off entirely. this item is going back.
0,Looks nice and i did like the button detail on the collar. colors are nove and the feel is soft. i would probably have to get a petite smaller size.
-1,Big pockets make it look more like a bathrobe than a coat. there are no internal pockets and the loops for the belt are pretty skimpy - just a bit of string. the color is great  but the quality leaves something to be desired.
1,Fits true to size. good quality  style and length.
0,I saw this dress online and immediately fell in love with the bow design. purchased my typical size 4 but found it way too tight. i went to my local retailer to exchange it for the size 6. unfortunately  even the size 6 just did not fit right. moving around in the dress was challenging; the slightest shoulder/arm movement made the dress ride up. i was constantly pulling it down. the fabric is also quite stiff and heavy. overall  it's a cute dress but just not for me.
-1,"I wanted to love this dress! the material is beautiful! but sadly i agree with other reviewer. the model definitely has this pinned back! i am on the small side (5'5""  120 lbs  straight figure  very tiny ""girls"") and this dress looked awful. totally swallowed what little shape i have and the swing did make me look prego in front and back. the fabric is stiff so i think that adds to the sticking out oddly. as far as sizing the arm jokes fit great. xs ordered and length was good but wish the ""swin"
-1,This is a cute top but it runs pretty big. order a size down. the material is like a thick gauze almost  so i'd definitely wear a tank under.
-1,"I ordered these in m (5'8"" 140 lbs.) and they are tts: they fit well and are neither tight nor loose. the issue that i have with them (and the reason that i sent them back) is that the material  although comfortable  is completely transparent; if i were to try to run out to get the mail in these  the whole neighborhood would essentially see me bottomless! furthermore  these are not white but off-white (and quite a yellowy off-white  at that)  so these loungers don't look as cute with the feature"
1,The label says 100% linen  but it's so silky and drapey that it feels like silk and linen. it's not a scratchy linen at all. it's a very very fine knit  but the top is not sheer. i do not think you need a cami under it.     i bought the xl and the fit is just as shown. it has a slight drape  but it's not really baggy at all. i bought the grey and it looks lighter on-line that it really is. it's a bit darker and has a silver essence also. i liked this so much  i just bought another one in mauve.
1,Great very flattering bohemian dress! and it's silk!
-1,"These pants fit tts and are ask pictured in length on me (5'5""). i can go between a 4 and a 6  and tried the 6 and they were fine. that said  the fabric completed turned me off. it is that sort of stretch fabric with a sheen to it. i did not find them to be the wonderful wardrobe basic i thought they'd be- the fabric is just too stiff  and the sheen made them feel cheap  unfortunately."
-1,Luckily i bought this on sale... i now see the instructions online say to hand wash  but i bought mine in the store. the instructions on the tag said to wash delicate in cold water and tumble dry. i washed it in cold water and it shrunk to doll size.
0,"This top is so pretty in the photos  but it just did not work out for me. it is more of a pale pink color than off-white like in the photo and it just hung on me weird. i felt like it was true to size  but made me feel very boxy. i can say it was very well made  so maybe i'm just not the right body type for it. for reference  i'm 5'5"" and 135lbs. the small fit perfectly  but was a bit too wide at the bottom for my taste. i was willing to spend the money if it would have been perfect  but i'll sa"
0,I so wanted to keep this sweater but the invisible metallic threads that give the sweater its crinkled appearance are super scratchy and irritating. it definitely requires a long sleeved top to prevent the irritation as shown in the online photo. it is lightweight and i planned to wear it over sleeveless summer tops/dresses. i have averaged size arms and there was plenty of upper arm room. in fact extra room is designed into the sleeves. one plus for those with upper arm fit concerns. the lower
1,These jeans are pricey and worth every dollar.  fits in the right area and makes your butt look perfect.  ladies  if you have thick legs...these jean are meant for you.
0,I bought this dress to wear to my low-key backyard rehearsal dinner. the dress it's self is beautiful  good quality  and a perfect summer maxi. however  it was way too big. i'm 5'6  118 lbs  i typically wear an xs/0 and felt like i was swimming in fabric. i loved the style and make of the dress  so i choose to get it tailored.
0,This is indeed a very flattering dress and looks great - unless you move in it. the fabric shows every little lump and bump on your body as you move and clings to tights (only a little but just enough to make it annoying). if you have any jiggle at all  i'd steer clear. would have definitely kept it if the fabric were different because the cut is amazing but alas.
1,I bought this dress thinking it would be cute for christmas in florida but when i received it i wasn't so sure about a christmas dress. i like it for a casual night out with high boots. super cute!! i received many compliments!
0,I got this in black. will probably get in the purple print too. the purple is a bit more casual  while the black can be work appropriate if with a nice top. very comfy.
-1,The top is totally see through and fabric some what itchy.  it also feels cheap to the touch.  i love the idea but can't keep it for this price...i'm a shorty so i'd have to hem it too! sadly will return.
0,While i wanted to love this dress  i did not like the scratchy lining. i also did not like that the scratchy lining was considerably smaller than the overall swing of the dress; so it clung to my curves uncomfortably. i wish this had been done in silk  would have been a much nicer material. i returned it.
-1,"This is a very awkward and unflattering shirt. i am very petite--90 pounds and 5'2"". the arms fit--length and width  but nothing else about this fit. the scoop was so low and wide that i would require a shirt underneath. it fell exactly like a tent and made a bell shape around my thighs. yikes! it looks cute on the model  but not on me. the material is also very thin and felt sort of like it should be a pajama top."
1,I like to have a capsule wardrobe for all seasons so that when i travel  or just for everyday  i have a multitude of options with a few good quality pieces. i am not a fan of 'dry clean only' items  so anything that i can find that i can at least hand wash with good results and is within my color palette and sense of style is always a great find. this light weight cardi can work for multiple seasons easily  it is a tad boxy  but it actually works for me (5'4  34c  125 lbs) i can wear it with a c
-1,The overall styling was great  and the dress is super-cute  if a little thick (it's made of denim  after all). i ordered a size down from my normal  and even then  i was swimming in it. the worst part  and the aspect that will make me return it  is that the arm holes hang down so low that i'd have to wear a tank top under the dress. i'm returning it  though it is really cute and i love this brand. the arm holes killed it for me.
0,These pants are lovely and comfortable  but they are entirely too delicate. i wore them once and nearly any time something touched them  they snagged. i was worried about it when i saw the fabric  and thought i'd give it a try  but i didn't think it would be this bad. for the price  i expect better quality. also  they run a little large- unless i pull the waist down low  it gaps in the back and these look better worn a little bit higher  closer to the natural waist. i'm usually a 4/6  28/29 in b
0,I love this blouse  i've received so many compliments on it. unfortunately i just got it back from the dry cleaners and the color completely changed to a pale yellow! it also ate away some of the fabric  so now it's completely transparent... and i go to an organic cleaners!     retailer: if you can fix the fabric quality this blouse would be a classic.
-1,"This dress was cute in the photos but wore like a sack when i put it on. great quality  fabric was lovely  just a little sparkle at the hemline  scallops were great but i put it on  i immediately took it back off and put it back in the sack to return. love the look  it just was terrible on me. i'm petite  5'0"" and weigh 110# so i'm not large but the dress made me look like an oompaloompa."
1,"I ordered the black 2 months ago  it was on back order  and i jsut received it finally. the fabric is super soft  itried on both xxs and xs and could keeo either one. the ""v"" in front where it crosses is low  so most people do need a cami underneath  but you could probably do without for ultra sexy look (not my style  but could be done). i plan on wearing this with skirts  deresses and slacks... i saw a commet on the lighter color  not sure  but love this one in black for sure@"
0,Yummy  soft material  but very faded looking. so much so that i am sending it back. if a faded look is something you like  then this is for you.
0,It's a very cute design. it looks great tucked into a cute pair of jeans  if can even be dressed up. however  i agree with the previous comments about the top not staying folded down. it likes to ride up and is difficult to keep the style like the model in the picture has. it's a very cute design  it just needs to be worked with and adjusted time and time again as its worn. when it does cooperate  i've gotten many compliments on it! order a size up  i am normally a small but the medium worked be
0,I like this top. in the photo  the white in the print stands out. in-person  the white areas of the print (not embroidery) is dull  more like beige. the flowers and embroidery itself looks good  the print looks good. it is a swing top  looks better on a slender frame. such loose fitting tops just don't look good on my curvy frame. i sized down  could have tried 2 sizes down but the shoulder area was more fitted. i recommend the top for a more slender frame or if you like very loose fitting tops.
0,"I'm usually a small (5'5""  116 lbs  long torso)  but the x-small fit well. the black does look see-through in the pictures  but i figured i could wear a cami with it. it is see-through in person if you are up close  mainly in the back and arms since the front has extra fabric in places. however  it is rather short  possibly because it is an x-small  and i'll need a short cami to fit under it or will have to have a cami hanging out of the bottom  which drapes nicely and a cami may mar that effect"
0,This dress is really beautiful. very well made and high quality fabrics. unfortunately  it is cut very narrow. i am between sizes  ordered up and still felt like it was at least a size too small. i think if you have any curves in your midsection that this dress is going to be a challenge. if you are lean and straight then this will look great on you.
-1,I had to review this because i purchased before any reviews were up and now that i've received this dress i'm appalled by all the positive reviews!!! this dress is hideous in person. seriously hideous. and even if you can get past the drapery fabric  it's incredibly restricting. the picture online is so misleading. the dress isn't even an ivory it's more of a pea green! so disappointed.
-1,This dress has been in my inbox for a long time and when it went on sale i purchased it right away. i am a size 4 petite in everything retailer and have not had a problem with fit  if anything i might have to size down. i purchased a 4 petite in this dress and i couldn't zip it all the way up. it was as if i was trying to get into a 0 petite.  i don't even think a size 6 would fit. there is something not right with the make of this particular dress i received. even if the fit was perfect i didn't
0,As a petite  big busted woman  i found this dress wildly unflattering. the quality and pattern of the dress itself is beautiful  though it will require a slip as it is completely transparent. the design of the bust however  i found unflattering.
-1,I thought it was only me and immediately assumed i needed to go on a diet when i attempted to put this adorable skirt on. it got stuck at my hips. i'm a very consistent size small in dresses and skirts. i actually thought about putting it on over my head but that was impossible. its going back. now i see the other reviews and am relieved that its the skirt and not me! wish i had read them before purchasing. retailer is going to get a lot of returns on this one.
1,"This dress is absolutely lovely. i couldn't leave the store without it  even though it was full price and i have a million dresses. it's just that great. i am 5' 8"" 130 lbs and bought the small"
0,So i thought this sweater would be snowy white  but it's actually a beige kind of dingy color. i do not mean that it's unattractive  i do like it  just because it is not snowy white like i thought  it makes it more of a casual sweater in my opinion and i was hoping for a dressy sweater. it is very super soft and is as long as it is pictured. it fits like a dolman sweater which i did not expect either. it's a bit fitted around the very bottom and sleeves are billowy at the top.the picture does no
-1,Loved this dress when i tried it on in the store and thought it would be perfect for a casual wedding. unfortunately  the day of the wedding the zipper split and i had to wear something else. it fit well  but was poorly made. based off other reviews  this isn't the first time this has happened with this dress! not worth the risk at all.
0,"While i loved the material  color and concept of the dress  it was much too large and sack-like. i'm 5'2"" and 108 lbs  pear-shaped. i purchased the regular xs given stated length in the description. while the length was just right  it was just much too large throughout. i'm not sure that even an xxs will help so sadly  this will be going back."
1,This is one of the cutest tops i've ever gotten from retailer. the material is very soft and flowing. it fits true to size and hange beautifully. love it. i should have gotten he turquoise one too!
0,Despite other reviewers comments on size - i really wanted this one to work so i ordered it. i'm typically a size xs and d chest and instead i ordered a small. the body of the sit for well but the cups of the suit i'd said for more for a b. (if i lifted my arms i would literally come out of it)
1,Fun transitional dress for fall that can be worn with ballet flats  boots or booties. true to size. for reference i am 5'9  138 with an athletic build.
-1,The material is thin and of poor quality.  it snagged the first time i wore it. the arm holes are very low as other reviewers stated.
-1,I ordered these jeans twice because i love them. the first pair were mis-marked by about 4 sizes so i re-ordered. second pair still didn't fit  they run really small  i would probably need one maybe two sizes larger than normal to achieve the fit and feel of the other skinny jeans in my closet:(
-1,Ordered this top online  as i loved the colors and design  but i should have listened to the other reviewers. i ordered my usual size m  and it was just very unflattering. it was short and wide  not at all like it's pictured on the model. needless to say it was immediately shipped back.
1,This shirt is a very cute dressed up casual kind of top. the lace detail in the front and the back make a plain  long sleeve black top look elegant. the material on the shirt is pretty light  so it is for fall or spring.
1,I don't own any peach outerwear because i didn't think it would complement my skintone. this cozy bomber proved me wrong. wonderful quilting pattern and a vintage dye job that's eye catching. great for layering and the color goes with my autumn and spring wardrobe. this is not a fitted style  it's relaxed and a bit poufy at the sleeves and waist  just like a regular bomber jacket. i chose medium petite and it fits just right. i'm a 36d  135#  38-28-35.
-1,Such a beautiful and unique design - i only wish it fit! it is so  so boxy - i'm thin  but would have needed almost a foot of fabric removed in order to make it look right (and i don't mean making it super tight). the seaming and button details on the back are such that it would be tough to have a tailor refit it appropriately. so  i had to return this  despite really wanting to find a way to make it work.
1,"Love this dress so so much! the wearability of it isn't much since it's such a ""wow!"" dress  but if you have a wedding that it would be fitting for  itso perfect. if it were a touch shorter i'd be happy wearing it to the park. i'd suggest hemming if you want to make it more casual buy why go there when it's so stunning long. the sales associates in store kept telling me i looked like a princess ( although that may have been my doing as i kept twirling for them saying "" look how cool this is!"") ."
-1,The sweater could be really pretty  but it is huge. i ordered the xs/s and it was swimming on me. it's too bad  because the stitching was beautiful  but this item is going back.
1,I ordered this top (black) in both small and medium; i can get usually away with small at retailer but am size medium in all other stores. as soon as i received the package and opened it up  i knew i would keep this top. it has a gorgeous texture to it  a slight sheen  and is well made. it's extremely comfortable as a t-shirt would be  but has more structure and looks very chic. the waist nips in just enough to give the flutter hem a little flare at the hips and is very feminine. i have a long tor
0,I love the look of this dress and the material - the problem is that when i tried it on the fit was a bit off. it seems that the arm holes hung down way too much and pulled the dress so it is uncomfortable to wear. i don't think i could have gone down or up a size to make this dress work. it is a shame because i really liked the look of it.
1,I ordered the green  black and ivory because i thought they were so cute. the sweater is short but still cute. the ivory one i will return though. it has sparkle that's not noticeable in the online picture plus when it arrived it had a huge snag in the fabric. i'm actually quite surprised they sent it to me in such poor condition.
-1,Loved the material and the style. unfortunately  my fears came true when i received this swimsuit  and there wasn't enough support despite a review i had read. as a 36d  i thought the halter would be enough support  however  the material is too stretchy to rely on that completely. i am sad i won't be keeping this though. the material is heavenly!!!
-1,I purchased this top in the black and tan color  loved the fit  style and fabric. however  it is a loose weave and after just one wearing a hole opened up on the front  which could not be repaired. it was covered by the cowl neck collar but as the day wore on the hole got bagger and it can no longer be hidden. i was very disappointed in the quality of this top- i purchased it at full price and was only able to wear it once. i just didn't have the time to return it to the store.
-1,I have a few evening functions this month and the next few months and i thought this dress would be different and fun. i really wanted to like it  but i could not. there were spots missing sequence  some fell off as i tried the dress on  and i did try it on twice. each time there were some on the floor. they are sewed on so poorly  for the price of this dress. i fear it would be a dress for one season and i'd have to throw it out. not for that price. so back it goes.
1,"The lace detail adds a nice spin to an otherwise plain tank. looks great under a cardi  jacket  sweater coat... for the most part it fits true to size. it's not as fitted as i hope it would be. at 5'1""  115lbs  i got my usual xsp. my biggest gripe is the very deep v-neck--its shows my bra. eek. it's like the strap could be shortened to help remedy it but then it may leave the arm hole too small or bring it too high up. perhaps it may shrink in the wash or i just need to get bigger boobs. maybe t"
0,This is a darling little sweater. it is well made and the fit is true to size  however  it's just not long enough on me to be a top  which is what i was hoping for.  i thought it would be pretty with some high waisted trousers in a sort of 40's style but it's way to short on me for that. even with my highest waisted pants and skirts  it shows skin.  i think it can really only be worn as a shrug over a dress or something.  that explains why the model looks hunched over in some photos.  i'm still
1,Sorry  but i disagree with a previous reviewer who wrote that this buttondown is sheer and runs large. as for sizing  i purchased my usual size small. the fit is intended to be a bit slouchy  and it fits perfectly through the shoulders and the bust. love the high/low hemline  and the back isn't too tight across my bum. i'll also note that i'm 57 years of age and might tend to be a little more modest when it comes to sheer fabrics. the see-through factor is not an issue with this buttondown. i'm
-1,I'm very disappointed in the quality. it seems more like a pajama than a tunic. definitely not worth 100.00 dollars. i plan to return it.
1,It's hard to go wrong with the charlie's  especially in this fabric  keep them coming!! i wrote a review on the brush strokes as well. they fit pretty true to size  i'd say try both your usual size and one size down as well  they stretch out a little  so if they feel a little tight keep that in mind. because of the texture of these pants you can wear so many more colors than just usual black and white trouser fabric. try wearing a burnt orange  green  or pink (the isabella sinclair grid wrap but
-1,Very poorly made- wide and short  very unflattering. the material is advertised as cotton  but it felt very synthetic.
-1,Runs small. i'm usually a size sm for retailer clothing (for reference  i'm 5'4  129lbs  36b). the tie around the waist of this dress is not a functional tie that you can relax a bit to give yourself more room around the waist. i could not fasten the buttons to close the dress on the size 8. the size 10 fit enough to fasten the buttons but there was a lot of extra fabric and the arm holes were very large. pretty  vibrant colors but size up and be warned of the large armholes.
1,This top was very pretty when i got it  but i was hoping it would be a bit longer. the v neck design was nice  and the fabric very soft. i liked that a simple t shirt was so feminine.
0,I want to like this sweater. the color is lovely  more of a grayish blue  and the design is nice. the quality is amazingly good  as it's thick without being too thick and very soft. but the design is odd and quite unflattering! i got the xsmall but it's two big. the sleeves have a very low shoulder so they almost have a wing like look. it doesn't look like it does on this model. the waist area is a lot bigger  so it does sit on your hips  however the sweater isn't slimming cause of the odd shape
-1,I am returning the dress. it has too much volume and is not flattering at all
0,"I love the color (mustard) and design of this shirt! however  the description says it's made of cotton and i was disappointed to find when it arrived that it's actually made of 100% modal ? which is a big difference to me. i also think it runs small ? i ordered a medium (5'5""  125#  34c)  but would have had to order a large if i wanted the look pictured on the model. finally  the modal fabric is quite thin and i don't imagine it'll last too long without tearing. i'll probably keep it because i l"
0,"Wish someone warned of the navy one being not as pictured!! i ordered the navy because the crocheted part appeared to be more intricate than the ivory. in reality the navy knit is just like the ivory. it seems well made but very delicate. i'm not a fan of tops (especially pricey ones) that require a camisole but this top is a very ""retailer"" piece so most likely i will keep it  just a bit disappointed."
1,Girls  this dress is gorgeous.  but if you are an a/b cup  there is just too much fabric in the bust.  the entire dress is pleated from the shoulders down  so a curvier figure would be shown to great advantage in this beautiful number.  alas  i had to send it back and was very sad to do so.
1,Beautiful color and super comfy. it runs large but the gathers still allow for it to have shape on the top.
-1,I recommend this product  but with the following reservations.     the dye from the product colors my skin every time i wear this outfit. i love the fit and make of the jumper  but i hate that my skin looks blue by the end of the day. this is still happening after several washes  which makes me feel disappointed. it will dye your undergarments so choose wisely.
-1,I was looking for a dress for playing cello at my friend's wedding. the colors looked perfect  the cut was great  etc. very disappointed to find out how sparkly and scratchy the dress was in person  and sad that the slit came right to my knee  which is a really weird height. sadly returning - might purchase again if it goes on sale and i can't find anything better before the wedding :(
-1,I saw this on sale  and it looked lovely online. i really wanted to love it when i received it. it looked great  but once i tried it on  it bunches up in the back. it looks awkward. the lace and small details are pretty  but the fit is just off. returned it in the store.
1,This dress rules.  so comfy  and versatile.  flattering cut.  great with flats  wedges  booties  boots with tights.  easily my new fav.  runs large.  i am usually a 6/8 and the 4 was perfect after i steamed it.  no button gap either  i am a 34c.
1,The color is a very soft peach  and the knit top over the gauze is a very light  summer-weight knit. i can see this being worn casual  or dressed up with a statement necklace and nice skirt / pants.
0,This shirt is thin and probably not worth full price  but it was flattering to my figure. covered my post baby tummy and complimented/minimized my g size chest  but the cut was off. the seams for the arms were almost in the front at the chest  so when i moved my arms i had limited movement forward and it pushed the embroidered panel out and was just irritating. an entire day of readjusting my shirt would drive me crazy. i tried the m and the l.
1,I am usually a size small and had to size down to an xsmall. as mentioned in another review  it runs large in the armholes and across the bust  which is why i'm counting off one star. the armholes are also cut in quite a bit  so i will wear either a strapless or racerback bra. i am fairly small busted and the gathers falling from the yoke lay nicely; however  i can see that it might not work for someone who is more amply endowed and that it might have a maternity look. that said  the detailing i
1,This is so beautiful and looks hand made but in a really good professional way. this will be a perfect fall wardrobe addition and i can't wait to wear it with a long sleeve top and jeans and boots. it's not too long and it is very flattering and soft and drapes well. love it.
1,Beautiful color  great quality! on sale too. a must have!
-1,I had loved this on-line when i saw the pretty floral pattern. however  in person  it is such a disappointment. the quality of the fabric and the fit are just very poor.
0,Ok so when i bought this in every color there were no negative reviews. i loved this shirt. it was amazing. fit perfect was so comfortable. then i washed it. ahhhh. it shrunk so bad my3 year old could wear it. i washed it according to the tag. then the second color i just hand washed in ice cold water and laid flat and it still shrunk. man. i wish i could return these shirts. they are so bad. and i typically love bordeaux quality. these are horrendous.
1,"I read all the reviews before purchasing this and took the advice of others on sizing up. i am 5'4"" hourglass shape (32d  27 inch waist  size 28 pant size) and normally wear a size 4p in retailer dresses. i ordered a 6p and the top was way too big on me. i went straight to an retailer store to try on a 4 regular and the top half was perfect on me. a little too long for my liking (about an inch below my knee)  so i re-ordered it in a 4p. this dress ran true to size for me. i recommend trying it on in"
-1,Totally bummed. the pretty print doesn't outweigh the very odd fit of this dress. makes you look really top heavy and even the print  which looks so cute online  looks muddled in person. sadly  went right back.
0,I like the color and the plaid pattern on this top. the material is soft to the touch and despite being petite  i bought the regular length to pair with tights. it has the feel of a baby doll because of the longer length on me. i quite like the feminine cut of the top which makes it slightly unique as far as plaid tops go. the material also doesn't feel too flimsy or cheap and the top feels well made. it will not be hard to reach for this item as it is a versatile piece  as many reviewers have n
0,"I didn't realize when i ordered  that the hem is unfinished below the seam.. i'm not a fan of this look  especially in a more expensive skirt. the fabric is nice and flowy.. but i do feel there is maybe too much of it(which may be a plus if you wanted a fuller skirt) and that the waist runs slightly small. i am normally a 10-12 and ordered the large and it fit at my natural waist  rather than hanging lower and looser like other styles in this shape. i am 5'7"" and i do like fuller skirts  but was"
-1,"This wasn't for me. i have a short neck and am 5.3"". the length was fine on the one i tried on  but other proportions were off. it was too big around  in the middle  yet tighter at the bottom. on me  this made it resemble a large bag. the neckline stood up on mine. even when i pushed it down to resemble the picture here with the model  it still felt like a whiplash collar (coming up over my chin). i gave it four stars for quality since the material is so soft."
-1,Was excited to receive this dress as i got it at a great price on sale. the colors are great and it fits pretty good  but it came without a slip!!  so disappointing to not receive the entire dress!!  hence the 2 stars. may send it back for this reason.
1,Beautiful and comfy!!!! love it!
0,This runs really big. i usually wear s or m so i got a small but i need the xs in this top and it is sold out. i don't have a store close by (about an hour away) and i hate paying shipping for returns! i will either have to plan a trip to the store or try to exchange for size over the phone. i debated keeping the small but it is really too big .... i love the style though!
0,Love the idea of this but it ran short and boxier than i would have liked. material is soft  cute design but not flattering. returning
1,Super cute and simple shirt (as other reviewer said lol). but she was right! i have another shirt from this brand and it's one of my favorites. it runs true to size. it's a nice casual wear with jeans kind of shirt and great for fall. it may be a little short for someone with a long torso and/or tall as i'm only 5'2 and i wouldn't want it to be any shorter.
0,It's just ok. very thin and feel like it might say and stretch. color is very nice but much thinner and sheer we than what i wanted.
1,Beautiful dress! i usually wear a size 4 regular  or a 6 petite (if the dress has sleeves). i ordered this in the 6p and it is too big. wish i could exchange it for a 4p  but it's no longer available.
0,This jacket is very cozy but i had to send it back. i think it will be great on a taller person.
0,The dress is precious and looks good on all body types. however  the bust is extremely tight. i had to go up a dress size just to fit in the chest area.
-1,Per the other reviews i sized up and got the medium. it was still tight around the girls (and i'm not that well endowed)  but too big in the armholes. the fabric is a kind of thin tee shirt material. i kept it (because i'm lazy) but not sure how much i'll wear it given the strange fit.
-1,Runs large and it also had a small hole in the back had to return it.
1,"This dress makes me looks curvy thin and sexy! i tried on almost every dress in the store in every style. this one was a winner. i bought 2 others but this one was my favorite. i'm 5'5"" 130 (32dd) sz4 fit perfect. the picture on-line does not do it justice - you must give it a chance and try it on for yourself. it looks like an average dress on the model - if you have curves you'll love this dress!"
-1,"I know this product description says oversized but that's an understatement. i ordered a small and tried it on and i looked like a little kid in their father's jacket. i don't even think an xs would have worked. i'm 5'6"" and about 135 pounds for reference. i will say that the embroidery on the back is very cool and this jacket is overall a cool concept but it's just way too big."
0,I bought this dress for a fall wedding and upon receiving it was very impressed with the quality of lace and the color. however upon trying it on the seam up the back was slit so high that my undies were visible. i would like to assume that the dress that i received was defective... it didn't really make sense given that the length of the dress was appropriate  i did not have time for a return so i had the seam completed. after that alteration (on my own dime) i was very happy with the dress and
0,But  saldly  no....i tried the multicolored version in a size m and l. the fabric is almost good  though a touch sheer and perhaps problematic for washing. the real issue  though  is the fit. fyi: 36c  broad shoulders/back  high waist i typically wear a m in a knit top  but the waistband was tight and not forgiving. i think that the problem was that this is a top with a long waist. when i tried to put the waistband where it wanted to be (longer) it made the peplum stand out in an odd way from my
0,I bought this on sale thinking it was a great deal  but when it came in i found it to fit like a totally unflattering sack. the pattern didn't help anything  looking totally faded and washed out...the fabric and overall quality is nice  but the fit and pattern are just so..ugly  unfortunately. had to return it.
0,"Would recommend  but with the caveat that i had to return due to the pants being way too big all over  even the length was more than i expected from the photos online. i am 5'5"" 120lbs narrow hips  usually a 25 in pants (including other level 99 pants i own). i ordered a 25 and i could have pulled them off completely buttoned  plus they went nearly to my ankles. anyhow  the material is really nice  soft and comfy  color was good (i ordered the dark)  and i could imagine they would be super cute"
-1,Wow! this sure is close fitting  as in suction cups to your body! yikes  definitely not forgiving for those of us with curves. to me  it seems like the material will wear well. i bought this for a great sales price so i may keep it  not sure. it would work fine as a layering piece but if i gain even 5 lbs  it won't work. i ordered the medium and am usually a small. the large might have worked best but probably still pretty clingy. i do recommend this if you are thin with no problem areas.
-1,Cute sweater. snap was broken when i received it. and i looked for it at local stores and they are all out of stock. ugh!
0,Another shirt i really wanted to love. i adore green but so few tops are made in this color. (please make more!!) however  this shirt didn't work for me. i think it's a matter of where your curves live. the shirt was true to size  but my boobs meant i was showing more cleavage than the model  and the top part felt more like a bib than embroidery. sad coz it is lovely and feels lovely on. probably a great shirt for different body types. would love to see more green clothing....
-1,These were perfect in the legs  nice and stretchy  but problematic in the waist. i'm generally a 31/size 12  but i had to squeeze to get them to close. they've already gone back. if you have a tinier waist they'd probably be fine.
1,At first  i thought this sweater might be too boxy  but fastened at the waist  it's very flattering and the collar is face-framing  and the coral in particular (really more of a mango sorbet shade) is unexpected but cheery for winter.  but the big selling point is the warmth and the giant pockets. brought a new puppy home just after christmas  and this sweater is perfect for layering for late- night trips out with an easy place to stash my phone and treats. bought it in coral and pink.
-1,This is a crop top but super boxy and wide. i expected it to be more fitted in the waist. since it sits out away a from the body a lot  it was not flattering. i also felt the stitching to be a bit matronly for me. too bad as i am having such a hard time finding tops and i'm willing to pay full price for something that works.
-1,This is one of those you can tell from the hanger that it's not going to work. too boxy. too short. and the girlish ruffle makes it look like an over-sized child's shirt that got all messed up in the washing machine.
0,Following the advice of other reviews  i ordered a size larger than normal  since the reviews said runs small in the bust. the dress ended up being much too big everywhere  including the bust.  the dress was beautiful and great quality! sad i ended up with the wrong size.
1,Such great detail great beautiful in red and white.
0,I love how this dress is photographed  but when it arrived to my doorstep i was highly disappointed. there seems to be no shape to it whatsoever. the fabric is much stiffer than i was expected i thought it was going to be more like a sweater dress  but it is not an overly comfortable fabric and it does not move like i thought it would when i put it on. this one is going back.
1,This top is gorgeous in person! i'm in love with it! it's perfect for the holiday season. it runs a little big and long so i suggest going down a size for a more tailored fit.
-1,Love the softness and the length. the color was perfect. but you have be be a very skinny almost boney person for you to not show imperfections to your body. the fabric is not thick enough and does not have the give to over shadow normal imperfections. will be returning the sweater.
-1,"Wanted to love this top  and could imagine lots of outfits with it. the wide shoulders made my arms/shoulders look big. the ruching and extra flap landed at an odd place  accentuating my belly. it did arrive very wrinkled  although a previous reviewer said she found it to be a wrinkle free garment. maybe that made the look worse. overall i felt that it made me look 15 lbs heavier than i am  so back it goes. i am 5'7""  160lbs  34dddd  and the size large was the correct size."
-1,Is not a place i want to be  even if the style of a sweater is great.  yes  this sweater is very cropped  but i think it&amp;#39;s definitely intended to be worn off the shoulder to drop the waist a bit.  it&amp;#39;s the itchiness that makes it an immediate &amp;quot;no&amp;quot;  and that&amp;#39;s coming from someone who has serious fiber itch tolerance.
1,I really like this top  a nice spin on a class sweatshirt. fun with a pair of jeans or cords.
1,Fun take on the white shirt- it is flattering and fun. and yes- very soft material so comfy!  but as others have stated  the material is very thin so your full bra outline will show- or you throw on a cami.
-1,On my screen this looked like burnt oranges were mixed with pink but this was all pink & very washed put pinks - looked awful on me as brunette. maybe will work for someone who likes pastels. overall style was also disappointing- just hung. this went back.
1,I originally ordered the peach stripe tee in my normal size  medium. after going to the store and trying another color on in a small i realized i should have sized down. i have since purchased the blue stripe in the smaller size. i love the fit and the colorful stripes of both. great light-weight  casual tee. i love the button details on the shoulder.
-1,This dress looked super cute in the picture and on the model. i ordered the petite style and it was still so big and way too loose. no shape whatsoever! i unfortunately had to return it. i love loose dresses but this one was way too big  loose and had no shape at all.
1,"The pattern ""camouflages"" my curvy figure :-) . the fabric is very soft  great for lounging. i wish the fabric offered a little more support though for working out."
0,This sweater dress color is great and texture is nice however ran huge. read the other reviews before ordering and ordered down to a medium and was just to boxy and could not get it to hang well. unfortunately it went back.
1,I ordered the cream. the fabric is unique. similar to a waffle but with a dressy quality. you definitely need a cami or tank underneath. its form fitting without being too snug. i like to wear it with distressed jeans  front tucked in and kind of ruched to hide my middle  (my trouble spot) with chunky accessories  belt  necklace and a block heel. it's a little pricey but decided worth it.
-1,I love the idea of this shirt  but the execution is absolutely horrible. i ordered online and what i received is just a mess. the stitching at the bottom has big globs of black thread. not just a few hanging off  but literally big clumps. a large portion of the stitching on the whole shirt looks like it should be on the underside of the shirt as the where the thread is tied off is on the outside!! the fit is just as big a mess. i always have to buy a large in fitted shirts because i have very br
-1,Had to return. ordered an xs which usually fits perfect. 34b chest and it was falling off. shoulders and chest!! it was like a sleeping bag. huge fan of retailer but there is a design flaw in this sweater.
-1,"I had high hopes for this sweater and when i found it on sale online  i jumped at the opportunity. i am 5'11""  slender and always wear a small in retailer tops. i purchased this in the mint   size small and as soon as i opened the bag  i had doubts. the fabric is terrible  thin and scratchy. it is not soft and supple as i had imagined. the mint color looks faded and the shape is awful. the length of the arms hits in a bizarre spot  the overall length of the sweater cuts me off at the torso and the"
0,This top runs large. i am going to return the medium i ordered for a small.   i wish it came in different colors. i love the style.
0,It is a proper fitting oversized shirt. however  it is very flimsy and even see-through as a summer weight shirt. i returned it because i don't want to wear a tank or cami under it during hot weather.
1,I love this dress. as a petite woman  it's hard for my to find maxi-dresses that aren't terribly long and that cut in the right places. this dress fits perfectly! i love the slits in the side that allow for a flowy look and make it easy to walk around. there is also an elastic band that helps the materials over the bust stay in place along your torso. if you a bustier person like myself  it will likely cut in just under your bust line as opposed to as your waist like on the model. since i am bus
0,I really loved this dress. it ran small but it was also shorter than i imagined which was only worsened because i'm curvier on top. would be great for slender figures.
1,The blush stripes are subtle but they definitely give elongating effect to your legs.    very comfortable pair of crop pants but my calves are definitely feeling tight in there!
-1,This coat is beautiful in color and design. we could have been great friends but it was waaay too big so i had to return it. i bought the smallest size possible yet i could have been 9 months pregnant and still would have had room to spare. i also was disappointed that the sleeves were not lined like other coats in this price range.
-1,As soon as i saw this dress  i absolutely fell in love with it. when i got it  i noticed it was slightly small  but figured i could deal with it. i was packing for my vacation and tried it on again just last night and i noticed the bow is coming off the back. i could fix it  but honestly a dress shouldn't start falling apart before you even wear it. it's cut on the small side. wish i tried the larger one  but now it's sold out. and i was kind of disappointed there were no pockets as pictured. i
1,This dress is beautiful in person. i am 5'1 and was afraid it would be too long but it was perfect. i only need 2 inch heel and it will be fine.  details on the flowers are really nice. one more plus it machine washable.
0,As other reviewers have noted  the fit of this tee is very boxy.  it looks okay tucked-in to high waisted jeans  but otherwise is unflattering.  also  the color is described as black  but mine looks like a navy blue in person.  i kept the shirt because i live overseas and returning it would have been difficult  but if able to  i would have returned it.
-1,I agree with other reviewer  the material of these jeans is not the same! thin  stretches  and you end up pulling them up all the time. i am a short  curvy girl and would love to have the old jean fabric back! this seems to be the trend in jeans?nydj also uses this fabric?stretches too much.
0,The idea of this dress is lovely. the fabric is pleasing to the touch. the print manages to be eye catching but understated. i don't know my exact measurements but i typically wear an extra small and i rarely have fit issues with off the rack clothing. i read the other reviews about the odd fit but decided to take a chance. i ordered an extra small in this dress and the bottom half fits perfectly. the top fits poorly. i have a fairly athletic build but it is a bit too large for my shoulders. how
0,This shirt fit really really big! i ordered an xl but think i could get away with a l  if not a medium. sadly  it's going back :( otherwise  it's high quality and a beautiful design.
1,I have a few pair of charlie's and one thing i really like about them is their consistent fit. i own this pair in both the orange and gray  bought both in my normal 4. they will stretch so if they are a little snug at try on don't size up. definitely recommend these pants.
1,I got this top in the black and i love it. the bottom is a silky material that's really beautiful  and the cutout details are really pretty. so many of retailer's sweaters are enormous  but this one fits tts.     my one complaint is that the bottom white part wrinkles really easily.
0,The colors and print are absolutely beautiful and i'm quite heartbroken that this suit just doesn't fit. i don't have a long torso but the v was just so plunging that i wouldn't feel comfortable leaving the backyard lounge chair in this bathing suit. no matter how much i tied the halter it still revealed a v halfway down to my naval. the strange thing is that there seemed to be too much fabric on top  lots of ruching and thicker straps than i would normally go for  and while i'm only around a b
-1,Didn't work on this curvy gal.  sizing up would have helped with the button gaps  but the flowy shape of the blouse would have looked too maternity on a larger size.  major pass.
0,I'm just not sure about this top... it's very short. i'm short-waisted  and it could stand to be at least an inch longer in front for me. and as another reviewer pointed out  there's no closure in front. i can't imagine wearing it without a tank underneath... one good stiff breeze and everyone would get a peep show. it really seems more like a vest than a shirt. it's cute enough with a tank underneath  but that sort of defeats the purpose of an easy summer top... it's too hot for layers in the s
1,I have worn these exclusively for the past couple of years. they fit great (tts)  stay put  and wear very well. these are well worth the price.
1,"I am normally a pretty big fan of the moth brand  but i took a chance on this dress/tunic and i am so glad i did! i love love love this piece. it's soft  light weight material make t perfectly versatile so spring  winter and fall. it's so easy to throw on with a pair of leggings or skinny jeans and dress up or down with a scarf or necklace. i've already worn it several times and wearing it right now actually! it fits very true to size  i am 36d  31"" waist and 5' 2"" so i ordered a large and it fi"
0,"Nice weight and loved the design  but the inside was what i loved the most. it doesn't show in the photos  but the zipper is a light blue and the fabric is double-sided  so the inside is lined with light blue flowers on a darker blue background. cute detail! the only drawback was the length of the sleeves. they were about 2"" too long...and i have long arms! there wasn't enough stretch in band of the sleeve to keep them up once you pushed them up. the only other option i came up with was to fold"
1,I saw this dress in my local retailer store  and am not sure why i did not try it on then  but later at home it began to haunt me. i loved the colored embroidery against the black. my husband and i will be traveling to europe later this fall and i wanted to take a dress with me that wouldn't take up too much room  and be suitable for times when i wanted to dress-up a little. online i saw that it was available in the petite  and with the reviews warning that it ran large i opted for a medium petite
1,I ordered both colors in different sizes (xs and xxs) - petite were no longer available  so can't compare there.    color: i liked the black better for these reasons:  1) color can be worn year-round  just add a nice jacket or cardigan  and ok for winter season.  2) ivory was kind of see-through    size: xxs fit me better  the xs was wider and bigger arm holes.    sadly  the xxs was the ivory  so i didn't keep either of them.    ref: 115 lbs  30dd  26.5 in wasit
1,This is a beautiful dress. figure-hugging but covered up in places that need it. color is flattering and soft. wore with bainbridge layered necklace. bought for an afternoon function and wore with pumps. so versatile  will work for church or cocktail party. great purchase!
-1,"I have these shirts in the blue and green and they were great. i'm 5'4"" c chest and athletic build - the small shirts fit pretty good and i love the fabric so i kept them. i really wanted these dresses to work but the cut was different even between the gray and burgundy. there was tons of room in the chest  but it was tight in the shoulders. i really wanted to love this  but there's just too many cut issues. it is a good length for work though."
0,I wanted to love this. it is so cute and the xxsp  my usual size  fit perfectly. however there was a fatal flaw in the construction. the hem was not sewn properly - very asymmetrical and lopsided. instead of a scoop like shown on the model  it was much longer on one side than the other. i thought maybe it was just how it hung on me  but i took it off and laid it on my bed and i could clearly see that it was sewn wrong. this is going back. i ordered another one (now it's on backorder)  hopefully
1,Ever since i saw this dress i fall for it totally love the pattern and the colors. i got the size l and the fabric is really good. once i tried it on tho it broke my heart the dress fit perfect everywhere but in the v neck... the design there is odd i believe is for small breast cup girls  im size c and let me tell you  it look horrible  i was very disappointed so dress its going back :(
-1,I bought the shirt in ivory and went down a size per the advice from other reviewers. what i should have done was go down 2 sizes! runs huge! my husband said i looked pregnant and that's never a good look if your not. sent this back the same day.
0,"Its just ok. the bodice is fitted and this dress runs tts. it does have a little more poof on the skirt part of the dress than it looks on the model. at this point in my life when i buy a dress i have to say right away ""i love it"" and i just didn't. my husband looked and said it is just a ""blah"" color on me. so that maybe part of it. the fabric is nice  doesn't seem inexpensive and the lining is soft and falls nicely underneath the lace. i am 5'("" and the dress does fall exactly as it is shown o"
0,This top is not for a curvy figure. the embroidered part is gorgeous  very stunning  but the loose bottom part is awful. i am curvy and usually wear l or xl. this top was fitted at the top but very loose at the bottom  made me feel like i had a big tummy  and was a tad short. i am sending this back. this would look better on a more slender frame.
-1,This over-sized sweater is light-weight and scratchy. i knew it would fit big  but the neck is overly bulky. the color is a bright blue as depicted in the picture. fits a little larger (on me) than on the model. i'm petite so it overwhelmed me.
-1,As someone with a large chest and a smaller waist  i found this top incredibly unflattering (and i like swingy tops). it was too short  too wide in the hips  and too tight in the bust. the pattern and fabric are very pretty though.
1,"Love this sweatshirt! i'm 5'2"" 110lbs and ordered the x-small. it's a little boxy but very comfy. it's definitely light peach in color and not pink  as shown. very happy with this purchase!"
0,Wow  this runs small! i'm thinking the accidentally sent me an xxs?!?
1,Love this dress  very flattering fit and the fabric does not feel heavy but is sturdy - i wore it for first dinner out with my husband after losing most of my baby weight and felt great and confident in it.
1,"Great  rather heavyweight  long cardi. i purchased the blue  which is a lovely shade of gray/blue  not quite as bright as the picture depicts. pin is adorable; doubt i'll ever use it to close the sweater  but still a nice touch. for reference i'm 5'5""  136 lbs  34ddd and typically fall between size small and medium. took a medium in this one and glad i did. perfect fit. falls exactly like on the model."
0,Got this on sale in black and red  and have only worn the black. quality is poor  seems to stretch out over the course of the day and loses its shape somewhat. a smaller size may keep its shape better so you may want to size down. not worth full price.
1,I bought this dress as soon as i received the retailer catalogue. i rushed to the store because i absolutely fell in love with it. when i tried it on  i went a complete size down. i'm usually an 8  but i snagged this beauty in a 6. the top part really does run larger  so unless you have really broad shoulders  you'll need to size down. the sleeves hit my arms at a nice place  and the little tie in the front is awesome  because not only is it an interesting detail  it can be loosened or tightened d
0,It's a perfectly cute simple summer dress  but the only reason i'm even considering keeping it is because it was a gift. the material is fine but for this price  i expect something more exciting than what is  really  just a modified t-shirt dress. at least more exciting colors or a print or something. the top piece is 2 full layers which could get warm in the summer  and the ribbing is tight enough that you have to wear a bra even if you're small-chested (i'm a 32b and super thin and still neede
1,Love this top - it is a beautiful shade of blue and the buttons at the bottom add a nice touch. it is light weight and not too long or wide. i have other t.la tops in small  but the xsm worked better for me with this top.
-1,I love the pilcro serif legging jeans but these were a big disappointment. if you have any thigh at all don't bother.
-1,I ordered a size 16 in the orange. it ran a size smaller than normal size 16 maeve tops. the quality of the material was terrible. it wrinkled and was also so thin that you need to wear a tank underneath. that messes with the look of the lace on the top. the color of the orange was gorgeous.
1,Very cute on  fits well. versatile top  i think it will work well with a sweater or blazer for fall.
0,I wanted to love these great spring/summer pants  but sadly  they are just too unflattering for ladies with hips. if you have a ruler build  these pants will be fantastic  but these pants are not forgiving in the hip and thigh area for those of you blessed with a curvier build. i was really hoping for pants that had this clean  vintage inspired  audrey hepburn look re-imagined for the every-girl  because nothing is more flattering to an hourglass body than clean  non-bulky lines (something like
-1,"This top was just not flattering. i'm 5'8"" and medium build  and the m was very bulky and the fabric didn't fall in the right places. made me look very round and i'm not  so it's definitely going back!"
0,Two strikes against this top  and its going back. first  the white top is a light weight cotton... and it does not come with a lining or shell underneath. just know you will need one. i would have been able to get over that fact  since i have tanks i could have worn  but second strike is that it wrinkles. alot. it came out of the shipping box with the type of wrinkles that i know will get way worse after washing. i am not interested in ironing anything. for this price  i wouldn't have expected b
1,This top is sooo cute. it does not look like pajamas as one person said  it looks like a top. it's a bit on the boxy style  so anything you want to hide below is well covered. has a nice length to it. is not just for lounging. paired it with a black pencil skirt and it looked great. i ordered the xl (i am a 40d for reference) and it hung very nicely. its extremely soft and very comfy. i only wish they had more colors.
1,They fit me great  are super comfortable. they are casual  yet also stylish thanks to details like the colorful waistband and the zippers on the side of the legs. they looks great and i think i can wear them for many occasions. i love them with booties :). i think they look better in person than online  too

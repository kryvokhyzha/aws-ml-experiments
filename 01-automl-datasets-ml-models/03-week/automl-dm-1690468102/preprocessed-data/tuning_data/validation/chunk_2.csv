1,This arrived today and i am thrilled with it. the material is soft but not at all clingy. it drapes perfectly  falling just above the knee. there is a matching slip that is as nicely made as the dress itself. what a find!
0,"I was so excited to try out this top since it was such a bargain and neutral. unfortunately  the shape is ""a"" line and accentuates the hip area a bit more than i find flattering. so  it will be returned."
1,This sweater is super light-weight and is very cute.
-1,These ag stevie ankle jeans only have 50% cotton.tthe rest is 41% lyocell (a rayon)  7% polyester  and 2% polyurethane. result: thin and clingy jeans that show every lump  and stretch out.   .  these are no longer the same lovely ags in twill when they were at 80% cotton  18% modal  2% pu. it seems ag has also stopped making denim and corduroy with 98% cotton  at least in the stevies.  .  i'm sure these will be a great choice for someone looking for very soft and thin pants that feel like pjs  b
0,This is an attractive shirt but runs big. i ordered the black and white.
1,I love this shirt  it's easy to belt. i just wish it was tighter.
1,I ordered down a size based on other reviews. i am 5' tall  110 lbs and a size 26 is a great fit. i ordered both the navy and turquoise colors. my only complaint is the turquoise color is not the vibrant blue in the photo but more of a green tone.
0,I like this top. it went well with my olive pant. i tried in l and xl. l was a tad fitted around my tummy. xl armholes were too big and neckline was too low. i really wanted to keep this top but the low neckline just didn't work. i am busty  perhaps it may work better for a slender frame. i recommend this top because it is pretty  but the fit is selective  so its best to try out a couple of sizes first.
0,This is a very pretty jacket. light weight and perfect for spring/fall. i had ordered it online as it was not in my retailer store. i did end up returning it though. it does run large  i am usually a l/xl and based on previous reviews i did size down and get the l. the pockets for me were a little big an pushed out having an unflattering look! i was sad to have to send this one back! i was hoping to love it! someone smaller might love it!!
1,"I love this dress! it is more of a thick cotton linen than actual denim. it fits true to size in the sense that i am usually a size 6  but i would say it is smaller on top than normal size 6 dresses. i am 5' 8""  small busted  and a ""pear"" shape  so i like the more fitted style of the top with the a-line skirt. i love the length hitting just below the knee. it is flattering for my body type. seems well made and at a good price point."
-1,"The quality of the garment is high--a nice substantial yarn and a pretty crochet pattern  but the cut was totally off for me. i'm usually an xs/s  and was swimming in the xs. the arms in particular were huge and drapey  and the whole thing just hung on me (for reference  i'm 5'4""  120 lbs)."
1,Lovely sweater that is good with jeans or a skirt. i ordered an xl and my only complaint is that i wish it were a bit longer in the front. i am heavy chested though so that's how most tops fit me. i ordered the gray/black and it's really nice. i receive lots of compliments.
-1,This bra runs very small  and is hard to get on and off. i think if i went a size up i would be happier.
-1,Fight a bit snug over the bust then widens like a bell. not as cute as it looks in the photo. returned.
0,Too floppy; light and comfortable material but the tie-neck needs a shirt with a bit more structure.
-1,"This dress looked gorgeous  light and lacy in the picture  but when it arrived  the ""lace"" that appeared gold and black in the photo was more a solid brown pattern against the black which was not attractive. the inner sheath was made of a heavy  sequined material. it was uncomfortable  scratchy and felt like i was searing chain mail. it also added bulk to the dress  so that i looked ten pounds heavier. i can't imagine why they would design this delicate dress with such a heavy inner slip. the si"
-1,"I would say the skirt runs two sizes too small. i usually wear a size medium and based on other reviews  i purchased a large. i could barely get the skirt over my hips. even if it fit in the waist  it was much too short on me and i'm 5'2"". it's a cute skirt but it is fit for a tween."
-1,"I really wanted to love this shirt! the colors are gorgeous  very vibrant and just as shown. the fit was all wrong on me. i ordered the petite xxs and it was still too boxy. and  it kept shifting so the front collar of the shirt would ride up into my neck. it looked like a sack on me. for reference- i am 5'2""  112lbs...with a small frame."
0,The colors look better in person and the sweater knit is thinner than i expected (which is actually a plus in my opinion) so i was very happy when i opened the package  unfortunately the fit was off for me. the lower part and the back are perfect  the dress hangs nicely  no puffing  no stiffness. however  the upper part at the front was tight and something about the armholes made my arms and upper body look beefy (i promise i usually don't have this problem). i am 32a and routinely order xs. the
-1,I tried this on in a medium in the store and it was too big overall. i thought it was a nice concept for a feminine  whimsical top so i ordered a small online. but even then a small is still too big (and i usually wear a medium or an 8 in tops). maybe if it was slimmer through the ribs/waist area it could work but it just ends up looking maternity-ish and too voluminous everywhere below the bust. the front was too short  as well (stopped higher than what is shown on the model and i'm assuming sh
-1,I was definitely wearing retailer colored glasses (my term for when something looks great on you in the dressing room but leaves you wondering what-was-i-thinking when you try it on later) when i bought this. once i tried this on at home  i basically felt like i was swallowed up by this thing -- there's so much fabric layered in front and around your shoulders that you can actually feel the weight hanging down around your neck  and it naturally sticks out rather far in the back. i wanted to love t
0,My normal size 30 in the hyphen chinos fits my size 10 body very well. these selvage jeans were too tight in the hips  too loose in the waist  and too tight in the knees  and i don't have big knees. also  the cuff was down to the floor instead of ankle length. cuffed  they seem to have a 32 inch inseam  and these were regular  not tall. basically  i think you need to have a straight up and down shape with no curves  and very long legs for this jean to work.
-1,Very cheap looking material. looks cheap to cost $158.
1,I tried this dress on in-store and fell in love with it as soon as i put it on. it's beautifully made  the fabric is soft  comfortable  and free-moving  and overall it has a lovely vintage  romantic look. i actually ended up wearing it for a family photo shoot the next week  and was pleased with how it looked in our photos as well  especially the lovely way the fabric draped. another reviewer said it seemed baggy and oddly-shaped; it does seem shapeless before you tie the waist tie  but once tha
-1,"I love this dress as far as the fit goes. it makes my curvy figure loook even better with how it's cut. that being said the different patterns over each boob made the dress look crazy. it makes you look quite lopsided in the chest. wasn't just me  but my store people also agreed. had the pattern on the chest been the same it would be great  but even though my boobs are of ""mostly"" equal size  they looked too crazy. it's quite noticeable on. so sad:("
1,Purchased this dress at the sale price  with an additional 20% off sale  not exactly sure what to expect-- the print is so different than my usual style preference. so glad i did! while the dress is way oversized (for reference  i'm 5'4  132 lbs) ordered size sm but prob should have gone with xs) it's stylish  yet effortless. today is the first day of wear (at my office) and already received many complements.
0,I had a really  really difficult time reviewing this dress. the instant i touched it  i wanted to love it! in theory  it should have worked for me. fit and flare is usually a really great option for my pear shape. the silhouette shows off my thinner upper body and camouflages my thicker lower body. best of both worlds! however  as you can see for yourself in the photo  this dress makes me look pretty big. i'm a solid size 8 and i feel this dress makes me look like a 12. it really makes my middle
-1,These felt like they were cutting off circulation around the calves. i tried pulling them lower to reduce the tightness but that made them way too droopy between the legs. an alternative would be to clip the elastic  but ultimately decided to return.
0,Tried this on in store with red ag ankle jeans and the only thing i could do was chuckle. it looked like a sleeveless lab coat or butchers coat. take your pick this styling was not for me. the fabric is nice not flimsy. you can see whatever pants your wearing underneath but i guess that's a moot point since it does have a substantial side slit. it does run tts. i'm 5'3ish  118# and the size 2 fit ok. probably would have sized up to the 4 because a slight pull at the chest (34d-dd). in the end i
0,"I like the feel  stretch and softness of this dress  it's very comfortable. sadly  as others have commented  the armhole openings are just too long causing the dress to fit and look a little off around the chest area on me. i considered sizing down to a 4  but it fit beautifully other than the armhole area. unfortunately it will have to go back. i am 5'7"" 120 lbs  34d and ordered a 6."
1,I ordered this online  having never seen it in person. i loved it as soon as i touched the soft material. it fits me perfectly...i almost invariably wear a size 6 in retailer dresses and tops  which gave me the confidence to order online  and this dress is true to size. the detailing at the bosom is so flattering. the fabric is supple and hangs gracefully without clinging to my not-so-perfect waistline. i have worn this twice already  having received it only a week ago. the blue/black combi
-1,The first time i wore it  felt wonderful. had it cleaned and then the back end stated pilling. very disappointed with the price and quality. wish i could return for my money back. sad
1,"I purchased this top in the xs and was so excited to receive it as i love the layered look snd the back of the sweater was so cute online! the sweater itself is lovely  but it was a tent on me! waaaaay too big for my 5'3"" frame. if you're a taller gal or someone who likes more volume in their swing tops  this is for you. unfortunately  i had to return it."
0,I loved the romantic look of this robe and gown set  but the material was very thin and wrinkled and needs to be ironed. the m/l was uncomfortable and i normally wear only a m. sadly  i returned the set.
-1,I was really excited to get this dress and to my dismay when i pulled it out of the package i could tell i would be disappointed. i tried it on and i was correct....it looked like i was wearing a huge tent. i returned it.
0,"I love these jeans! they are really cute and comfy  however  they are way too long. i couldn't believe these were a 33 inch inseam  but i measured them and they are. i am 5'4"" and put on a 4 inch heel and they were still dragging on the ground :( these will have to go back as i don't think the same look can be pulled off if they were hemmed."
-1,I love tracy reese dresses  but this one is not for the very petite. i am just under 5 feet tall and usually wear a 0p in this brand. this dress was very pretty out of the package but its a lot of dress. the skirt is long and very full so it overwhelmed my small frame. not a stranger to alterations  shortening and narrowing the skirt would take away from the embellishment of the garment. i love the color and the idea of the style but it just did not work on me. i returned this dress.
1,Love this shirt! it is great quality and fits true to size in a comfy not too fitted way that a button down should fit. i love that it is a classic white cotton shirt with a modern edge with the little bit of fringing on the bottom and sleeve cuffs. it's great to wear with jeans or leggings and i can even see dressing it up or down depending on the accessories worn. i have already gotten lots of compliments when wearing it....everyone wants to get it for themselves! i'd even get it in another co
1,"I love his cardigan! i knew the small would be a little big since i am normally an xs or xxs. i decided to give it a try anyway. it's definitely a little big - i would have liked an xs to be an option (5'3"" and 110lbs  for reference). i'm keeping it because it still looks cute  just a little loose through the body."
1,Great for layering and staying warm in the winter. definitely stay on the larger size  the fabric has very little give but is comfortable.
1,Saw these in the store and had to have them. i wear them rolled up. they are lightweight. whenever i wear them i want to smile. the birds with hats are so funny. i wear them to run errands  have worn them when flying  etc. can't say enough good things about these pants. they wash well  no ironing needed.
0,This a heavy cotton which is great for fall. design is cute and pockets are interesting. the fit is boxy and can look bulky. i only recommend if it's on sale.
1,I love this dress! my goal is to have a closet full of clothes that are really cute and stylish  but are also very comfortable... this dress fit the bill. the mixture of the fabrics is even more cute in person than it looks online  and the fabric is so soft  it almost feel like wearing pajamas. the weight of the fabric also makes it hang really nicely  and so it's flattering. overall  a great addition to my spring/summer wardrobe.
-1,I usually like coats and wraps with high-waisted belts  but this way too high  and the fit was really unflattering. i can see it being chic on a tall  slender person  but it's definitely not right for my short  curvy body. returning it today.
0,This is a lovely  well-made piece by maeve  a longtime favorite of mine. the material is great weight and won't wrinkle  colors are vibrant  and design of the dress is cute  if a bit on the short side.    however  i  like some of the other reviewers  didn't love this this on me. the waist hit slightly above my natural waist (and i'm very short-waisted) and this particular sweetheart neckline did nothing to flatter my bust (i'm a 34dd for reference). the end result was a bit too dowdy on top with
-1,Looks lovely in the picture but looks poorly made in person  runs very small. i returned it.
1,Such a gorgeous weight  cut and style! the button detail is adorable and the fit of the sweater is fantastic. the hem style  (not sure what you would call it)  is incredibly flattering for an hourglass figure. i am 5'4  133 and 34dd. fit is tts  maybe a bit large but nothing crazy. love
-1,"I really didn't expect this sweater to be so short. i'm 5'8"" and there is no way it would fit me properly. i honestly didn't even try it on. i pulled it out of the bag and put it right back in and returned it. it looks like a crop top. i bought the blue  which was not as rich and nice looking in person as the picture. i love most things i buy through retailer but this was a swing and a miss."
1,I saw this in the store on a beautiful autumn saturday afternoon and was inspired for what i wanted to add to my wardrobe for the season. this blouse is just fun without being loud or overpowering. the coloration works beautifully with my wardrobe and i can wear this dressed up or dressed down; with skirts  leggings  trousers  jeans...with a vest  jacket  or sweater or on its own. it is substantial enough not to wrinkle and look sloppy  it is easy to launder and will travel well with my capsule
1,The material of this swimsuit is amazing. the swimsuit is expensive  but it is high quality in person. definitely one i'd recommend buying!
-1,I really wanted to love this shirt. the snowflake and stripe design is really cute  and the fabric is of nice quality. it's a very loose fit  which i would've been willing to work with  but... as mentioned in previous reviews  the shoulder seam rests in an odd place on your upper arm  and there are little bumps in the fabric on the arms that appear similar to what happens if you leave a shirt on a wire hanger too long. it looks like you have nubby little wings coming out of your arms. not attrac
-1,I wish i had read the reviews before purchasing online. i love how this top looks online but when i tried on the small that i ordered  it was comical. so so boxy. literally  shaped like a square. it must be pinned back on this model. maybe if i ordered an xxxxs it would have worked...or perhaps for a larger person  it may look super cute! just didn't work on my slim build. :(
-1,I would not recommend these pants if you have a curvy or athletic figure. these pants seem to be cut straight up and down. the fabric is not soft  the color is slightly more muted in person  and they are not as relaxed as they appear to be on the model.
0,"Material is nice. design would be so great if it didn't fit so large! i am 5'4"" 118lbs  athletic build. the dress could be belted i think (a very slim girl at retailer did this)  but it is not worth $158 in my opinion. if on sale i might keep it due to the hastle of returning it  however  it is not ""flowy."" it fits okay in the shoulders  almost too loose  and the rest looks like a potato sack. so disappointed!!"
0,This is a nice tunic but i wish it was a bit more structured. the band in the back helps hold it together so it doesn't balloon out but a few more pin tucks would have been nice. i do like the length and style as a alternate to a white button down shirt and it looks super cute with skinny crop pants.
0,"I love this top. it is very short and hits at a potentially unflattering area if one has wider hips. the fabric and swing to the ""skirt"" is adorable."
0,"I tried this on in the store and it fit like a tent on me. it doesn't help that i'm 5'1"" and the store didn't have the petite sizes. maybe on a teller person it would work better. or maybe if i had been able to try the petite size it would have more wearable. it is a comfy style and the natural fiber is a plus. i have another holding horses dress that i love which also runs large. i did not mark this as ""runs large"" because the sleeves are more true to size while the bodice is very billowy. i wo"
1,It was hard for me to rate how this was sized-it is tight through the bust  very baggy and boxy through the body  and short. looked gorgeous on the hanger though!
1,Dress is comfortable  feels great and the fit exceeds flattery. the length hits just above my knees and the small side triangle cutouts add a unique cute  fun but still classic detail that i didn't notice in the picture online. i love this dress and get so many compliments.
1,This is a great pullover. very cute for lounging at home or running errands. it does run large  i ordered an xs & it's pretty big. for reference  i'm 5'7''  125 lbs & 34 b. it is also a little pricey for lounge wear but i am keeping it because it is so cute.
0,Going to alter shoulders straps by shortening for a better fit. petite size would have fit better  but was sold out.
0,Thin rayon material. see-through and unlined. size down as this runs large. for reference  i'm 5'4  124lbs size 26 in jeans. in retailer clothing  i wear sz small or size 4-6. i ordered this in small  but the body and shoulders are too wide and unflattering especially with the shorter length of this top. that is why sizing is key. i know it is meant to fit loosely  but you will have to order a size down otherwise you will look larger and the dark piping details on this top will not fall in the rig
0,"The kimono is as pictured. the colors are true to what is shown on line  though the description indicates ""green multi""--it is not green. i returned the item  however. the quality is fine  but it seemed extremely over-priced to me. it seems to me that half the price would be fair for the quality."
1,I ordered a medium as the large in the store was a bit too big. i wore this dress to a casual dinner at the grill in the country club and felt so cute  but also comfortable. i think it is a flattering dress shape and fabric. looks just like pictured on your website.
-1,"I had been waiting for this skirt to go on sale as i fell in love with the style and print on the website. however  after receiving it in the mail i was disappointed to find that the cut was all wrong for my body type. i am 5'6""  size 4  hourglass/athletic. the xs was too big and made me look like i had no shape. would be cute on a girl with no hips/booty but unflattering on hourglass figure."
-1,This top has a nice design. i love the lace up back which makes it much more adjustable in shape. if you lace it lower it is more flattering to your waist. however the fabric quality is very poor on the white tank. it arrived with a small tear in the front hem area  which i could have easily fixed. it is very sheer; even with a nude bra  my bra was too visible for my comfort. plan on wearing a full camisole underneath  tank  or bralette you are fine with being on display.
-1,Received this product with a gaping hole in it. very disappointed in the quality and the quality control at the warehouse
0,I love the shape at the neck but the lack of shape really distracted me from loving this top. the fabric is nice but the big  boxy shape on the bottom doesn't do much for you. i agree with the other reviewers tha this top would be great as a maternity top because it really is cute if you have a baby bump. returning the top.
0,When i received the dress i went to try it on and one of the loops for the string to cinch the dress broke. guess that's gonna have to go back
0,I had high hopes after reading all of the reviews  but as you can see  the dress didn't live up to them. i ordered a size 8  and maybe a 6 would've fit better  but i'm not going to find out. the sheer area on the model really stands out; it does not in real life. there were loose threads throughout  and there really shouldn't be at this price point. i was going to wear this to a wedding  but as a member of the wedding party  i don't think it would picture well at all. i'm sorry that it's headed
1,Love the dress but ended up returning it as i'm not sure how often i would wear it. the only down fall is the dress is straight so you have to take smaller steps but stunning dress!!!
1,This blouse is so pretty and well made. it will be a new favorite with dark jeans and boots. it is very boho and a lovely blouse to feel dressed up a bit on a jeans day. loose in a flattering way (it does not look like a maternity top). very happy!

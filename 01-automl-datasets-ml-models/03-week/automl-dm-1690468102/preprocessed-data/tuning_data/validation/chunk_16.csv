1,These make your rear look ah-maz-ing!!! i mean  seriously good. every time i wear these  my husband cannot keep his hands off. usually  i'm 27/28  in these i took a 29. perfection. i also got them in the black and blue washes. i may not be wearing any of my other jeans at this point. so good. awesome price point too.
0,"I expected the waist to be cinched like it appears on the model but it isn't. i ordered the xs and i'm swimming in it (i'm 5'4"" and 120 lb). would suggest ordering a few sizes down to avoid looking like you're wrapped in grandma's table runner."
-1,I got this dress in the mail today and really thought i was going to love it. the color is a beautiful rich red  which was a nice surprise. i was expecting more of a dusty red from the picture. love the fabric - soft and appears to be good quality. the length is perfect - hit right at my knees (size small). the flow of the dress is great as well. the ultimate flaw would be the arm and neck holes. the neck hole was choking me but yet a little loose at the back of the neck - almost like it was on
0,I thought the quality of the fabric was good and liked the idea of wearing it  either with opening in front or back. it was a little larger then i was expecting and i wish it had a closure  (hook and eye or snap) at the top. it has three places in the back to tie together and when i tied them in a bow they came loose easily. overall glad i bought it.
1,I love this dress. i read the reviews on it before i purchased and they were spot on. i have broad shoulders so i ordered the large. it was still plenty roomy but i wore a royal blue sweater with it and it pulled the waist in just enough to make it fit without a belt. i would buy it again!!
1,Beautiful and chic. so glad i tried it on!
1,This top is beautiful and special. the burnout velvet (so nice and soft)  the flowers  the pretty metallic threads and even the back closures make it wonderful. i took my usual size 0. it is a bit more fitted on the bottom of the top (hip area) than i was expecting but not snug. i will wear this during the holidays and beyond! happy with my purchase and looking forward to wearing it!
0,"First  let me start out by giving a reference. i am 5'1""  138lbs  34dd  30  38. i usually take a size 8 in maeve  esp if there is no give. i bought a regular size 6.     first the good: the design. it is classy. it will keep boobies (the ones of the larger side) in place. this is amazing as there isnt really a way to wear a bra with with dress. it is slimming and i have hips.     the bad: surprisingly  the fabric gets dirty super easy. i have no idea why everything clings to it. i got my dress f"
-1,These were so perfect for the first hour or so. i was convinced they were my new favorite pants! but their initial forgiveness turned into a slovenly stretch  and they creased and wrinkled like crazy after i'd been sitting a couple hours. it looked downright embarrassing - saggy and wrinkly (radiating from the crotch  no less) . i got them in the gray  and it's possible that other colors use different  less awful fabric.
0,I'll start with saying that it's a beautiful coat- i get tons of compliments and love the color. it runs a little big but it's meant to have to a slouchy  oversized quality to it. my only complaint is that i've had it for about 3 weeks and already one button has completely fallen off and the two inside fasteners already feel loose and very delicate. there's no extra buttons to replace the old one with and i'm worried more of the coat is going to fall apart. super bummed about the construction qu
1,Another maeve maxi to add to my crowded closet! i adore the print  it reminds me of morocco. i went with my usual m based on reviews about the waistband. i will have to disagree as i should have chosen s instead. i'm not going to return it  but i think this will really stretch out because of the knit and weight of the jersey.
-1,I stalked this sold out product for weeks hoping my size would become available. when it did  i was very excited  in fact i ordered both a s and xs to be sure one sweater would fit me! unfortunately  neither did and i felt the actual sweater was not as pictured. the sweater has an overall baggy fit and the cutouts don't fall as neatly and as evenly on both shoulders as the picture shows  making the look a bit sloppy in my opinion. it is such a shame as this look is very of the moment and the mod
-1,This tunic could be great but there is some weird construction going on at the armhole. first of all  the armhole is way too low! second  there is a totally unnecessary side seam zipper under the arm. since this is a tunic it slips over the head no problem. no need for the side zipper  it adds bulk and distorts the way the fabric should hang at the side.
0,I'm glad this was on sale because i would not have purchased it at full price due to the strange fit in the sleeve. the shirt has a slight raglan sleeve  but the sleeves do not fit loosely  they kind of twist under the armpit area. i do not have large arms  so i am ok with straightening out the knit sleeves  but they do not fit right. i also was surprised at the unfinished edge along the neckline. it is messy and tacky looking  but i think that is how it was meant to be. my recommendation to buy
-1,I wanted to love these  they are cute and warm - but they have absolutely no elasticity. i'm so mad at myself for not reading the reviews because i ended up wasting money on shipping 2 pairs of leggings that i ultimately took right back to the store.
0,I loved this dress and was hoping to keep it. but  for an a-lign dress it was not roomy enough in the hips and the waist was baggy. i think this dress would look great on a very very slim build with straight hips.
1,I was looking for a dress for my engagement pictures and once i saw this dress i knew it was the one! i ordered the white in a small (size 2) i am 5'4 130lbs. it fits perfect and the length is just right. some reviews said it's boxy and has too much flow to it but if you have the right size it won't be an issue! yes  it's a lace dress so it's going to be delicate and you'll need to handle with care. but it's worth it  absolutely stunning!
0,"Love the colors in this top. it's a shame it was so big and baggy i'm not that big a person but really made me look big and frumpy . i am 5'6""  130#. athlete. size small was way too much material for my frame"
0,This is such a great dress  i hate to return it. it's pretty  a nice material  and an interesting cut. but like other reviewers have said  it is just enormous. if there were a size smaller than xs  or if it came in petite  i would exchange it in a second. but since there's not  it has to go back.
0,"Maybe i just have the wrong body type for these jeans  but even though they technically fit  i felt like they looked like ""mom jeans"" on me. i was fine with the high waist  which actually made them very comfortable  but the ankles were loose and long on me  where most ag ankle jeans are a perfect length. the quality is good though--the fabric is substantial and a bit stiffer than most of my other ag's  and the color is a nice saturated black. i tried on a size 27  and i'm 5'4""  120 lbs."
1,I have several pairs of ag jeans and am always pleased with them. i had to get these when i saw them in the store. i'm a sucker for cuffed jeans in the spring. i also love the dark wash. i was surprised when i tried on my usual size 27 that they were too tight. i ended up going with a size 28. for reference i am 5'4  122 lbs.
1,"Just bought this at the store. just to be safe  i thought i would try it on before ordering just to confirm the size. that was a good idea. ( i am a 38b  5'9""  and have variable results with trying to order with the size charts.) the large looked nice but was slightly too large in the chest. when directly compared to the medium  it seems the major difference is the length-- the large was > 1"" longer than the medium. i did not find either to be itchy and the construction seems totally ok."
1,This is a beautiful top  but it runs large.  i am exchanging for one size smaller.  it is worth the effort of exchanging!  well made  beautiful lace.
-1,I bought this dress because it was cute  swinging and lightweight -- seemingly perfect for this hot nyc summer. after on wash and dry  the dress is already ripped around two buttons. i'll still wear it but i don't think it'll last until next summer. kind of pitiful since it wasn't a cheap-o dress. also it is big but that seemed to be sort of the point.
-1,I was so excited to find this shirt on sale at my local retailer store. but  i did not notice the high percentage of rayon in the fabric  which caused the shirt to shrink significantly in the wash (even when following washing instructions). i washed it on cold with woolite and it is about half the length it was initially! i'm so disappointed. how can you make a shirt that can't withstand washing?!
-1,I ordered this and hoped it would be a fun & whimsical sweater for this winter. instead  it's just strange. it didn't fit well. too short in the overall length & in the sleeves. the shades of the yarn were drab. it also didn't seem made to last. it looked like it would pill/snag in a short amount of time. i returned it. i'd love to see a style similar to this executed better in the future. having a unique sleeve is a cute idea.
1,I love this dress. i've received compliments from everyone. it's long enough to feel appropriate for work or teaching in sunday school - and  it's beautiful!
1,"Absolutely beautiful jacket...the craftsmanship is amazing  and the colors remind me of a impressionist water color. the jacket runs true to size (i'm 5'7"" and 115 pounds with a 30e bust and the extra small fit perfectly). unlike the other reviewers  i didn't have issue with the bottom not lying flat or the collar bunching up. i wore it with a green leather pencil skirt and suede stilettos  but you can also wear it with skinny jeans as well.i got this very deeply discounted  and although it is i"
-1,I splurged on this pajama set for myself and now regret it. even though the design is adorable  the knitted fabric contains acrylic and started pilling a lot within the first week of wear. after a month and a couple washes  it looks horrible. it may be the worst case of pilling i've ever seen in a fabric. so so disappointed. it initially fit true to size but has stretched out a bit over time.
-1,Don't be fooled by the photos online. the color is a bright baby blue  not pale blue. it's a beautifully designed dress  however  the material is so bulky and heavy. it's so unflattering. i was afraid to try it on and my fears came true: this dress just hung on me and pulled me down. i wanted so much to love it  but i returned it.
0,Cute stripes and soft  but very pajama top like in feel/look... like if you wear it out  people will assume you've got the matching bottoms stuck under your pillow at home.
1,"I knew i would keep it as soon as i put it on -- comfortable  beautiful fabric  cute gold buttons!  as well  due to the cut  it feels roomy  but has a slender fit around the arms.  the ""denim"" color has beautiful detail  but i don't think i would like the maroon solid.  i wish there was another nonsolid color -- i would buy another one!"
0,Beautiful dress  wonderful fabric  very well made  just runs really small! so sad  i wanted this dress for a special event!
-1,Although the material of this top is beautiful and the quality is nice as well  it really did not lay right on me. i'm a 34d  and i got my usual size in a small. the arm holes were a bit too big  the waist was too wide and it overall looked like a bib on me.
1,"I am 5'0""  109lbs  32d  and the 0 petite fit tts. the fabric is comfortable and the dress well made. my only complaint would be that the picture of the model and the dress i have in my possession do not have the same coloured slip. my dress arrived with a nude slip. i was a little confused at first but when i tried on the dress i realized it was not a bad thing. the lace actually stands out. all in all  a greal buy. discounts make it worth it too."
0,I received this shirt in my typical xs and it fits perfectly. i?m not crazy in love with it but i also don?t dislike. the shirt is on the thin side. do i need to wear a cami underneath it  no. my concern is holes. it does remind me of a material that could develop some holes after some wear and washes. with that being said i?ll wash this shirt in cold water and hang dry and hopefully that will prevent holes from developing. the length is fine and i do like the slits in front?it adds a little dim
0,I was under the impression that the blouse is lined however i'd need to buy yet another tank to go underneath which may be an issue due to how short this blouse is. i returned it.
0,"I really liked the look of this top online  but when it came i had a couple of issues with it. first  when i tried it on i found the underarms to be a little snug (i normally wear a 10/m  and that's what i ordered). it makes raising my arms tough  and as a teacher  i need to be able to lift my arms above my waist. secondly  my husband's first reaction was that it ""looks like pajamas."" the abstract floral/stripe gets a little lost.  on the other hand  the color palette is very pretty and the qual"
-1,It is such a cute design and very soft and comfortable  but the picture for this product is very deceiving! it looks like the sweater is fairly long in the pictured product page  but it is considerably short. i am nearly six foot tall  but thought by this picture it would be lengthy  not at all! it is a beautiful sweater  might work better for a shorter stature.
1,Byron lars knows how to make you look like a woman with his magical dresses!  i decided to get the navy (i also own the sold-out marguerite aka carissima in bronze) instead of the black or white since everyone and their mother owns it already.  the lace of the top is different--more delicate but less intricate.  it's still very beautiful.    my body type is inverted and the dress is hourglass  so the size 8p fits great on top but loose on my hips and rear.  i'm going to keep this dress and do mo
-1,I ordered this style in the blue  red  yellow and white for the sale price. they all fit true to size  matching the model's photos. but  the quality is poor. the hems are frayed  they wrinkle easily  they're just a mess. the model's photos show a messy look so you know what you're getting. the positives are the colors. the blue is especially gorgeous. the yellow is like a spicy mustard shade. they are all comfortable. just sloppy looking. the sale price matches the quality. they do stretch out t
1,I ordered this in xsp navy with the merlot/burgundy flower and it fits above the knees as pictured. the tunic is medium weigh and has a-line shape with a loose waist and i find it very comfortable. the sleeve are straight cut (not tight) and 3/4 quarter in length. i will wear it with leggings and boots/booties this coming fall.. i find this tunic is well-made and disagreed with one review that it is cheaply made. (wrong color?) fyi: 102 lbs. 32c
1,Love this suit. i ordered up a size on the bottoms  and am so glad i did. the style fits true to size  is beautiful  and vibrant. i thought it looked like ribbing vertically  but it is just part of the design. it is not padded at all  but is thick enough to be seamless.
-1,I am floored by the amount of positive reviews on this dress! when i received it  it looked nothing like it does on the model. the bottom looked like dirty sand and was completely wrinkled. if you have anything above a c cup  the top looks completely unflattering. i looked so top heavy in this dress! definitely not worth the price. so disappointed.
0,Received this dress  the sleeves are very pretty  the drape was just what i was looking for  but the overall dress was not very flattering on me. i am a little busty on top so it pulled in a unflattering way. i would say that if you are tall and not on the busty side this could be an amazing dress on. this one had to go back
0,"1. i'm 5'5"" tall  145 lbs  and 38-32-40 and the size 30s fit me perfectly.  2. i like the regular hyphen chinos and the stet chinos  but these pleated ones looked like clown pants because the pleats widen the hips and the ankle cuff is very tight compared to the regular hyphen chinos.  3. i hated the mustard color. not flattering to me at all."
-1,I really wanted to love this top  but there is way too much fabric. it looks nothing like the pictures. it was more like a maternity top vs. a swingy top. i'll be returning this one.
0,I have a 36c bust. i bought this blouse in a 10  even though i wear an 8 or 10. i sized up based on previous reviews. this top was super tight in the bust (it literally flattened my breasts) and very loose on the bottom. it was not flattering at all. the material is gorgeous. it is thick. it is lined. it is darted at the bust and it flares out in a peplum fashion where the light fabric up top meets the dark band of fabric in the middle. the problem is that busty ladies will find the bust area wa
-1,This dress is absolutely hideous on my physique. ordered a size 6 and it hung on me like a cheaply made tent. i have an athletic built am a 34d. it is going back asap.
0,Other reviews are correct. but this has potential to look as good as on the model - structure and quality of the cotton are very flattering. makes legs look miles long. however this fits very tight  allows no room for extra tummy  hips  booty  or thighs. i ordered a s (i'm usually a 4) - was able to get it on (step into it from the top)  but felt a little self conscious about how tight the fit was. if there was an m  would have definitely sized up  as i really liked the look.
1,"I tried this on at my local retailer store in the white. the fabric is pretty with metallic threads of silver running through the white. the white is see-through but that didn't bother me as i would wear it as a beach cover-up. i would say it runs large. i am usually a size small (4-6) and the xs was quite roomy on me (and i'm 5' 9"" tall)  32d chest. i liked it  it was comfortable  but i just couldn't decide if i looked a bit frumpy in it. maybe it was just too big all over. in the end  i d"
0,Love at first sight (via the internet); upon arrival  i was on the fence. . the fabric is slinky and loose; so much so that i should have ordered a medium instead of a large (perhaps then the dress would have then been more of an a-line fit vs. an over sized dress with no body). the lower section of the sleeves is attached intricately to the upper arms; every slight movement of the body is followed by a slight tug at the sleeve/arm cloth; otherwise  when the arms are extended  the sleeves do hav
-1,Love this top! but unfortunately i returned it for exchange coz it was too small for me. hoping there's a sz sm in stock.
1,Absolutely love this suit. the bottoms are very comfortable and covers everything id like it to. it does not ride up at all  which almost never happens with swim suits. i'm going to order this in a different color next season. i paired the bottoms with the peplum top and received many compliments.
-1,I was not a fan of these leggings. these were very unflattering. i could see that after wearing these all day they could start stretch out. i just didn't feel like they would hold up for even one season.
1,I ordered the moss green color. i love it! the color is really cool  the length is longer  and the fabric is soft. great summer option!
1,This is really a gorgeous blouse. the design is very feminine and elegant  and fits true to size. i didn't think it ran short and the material is light and airy. it sold out so quickly so i had to wait awhile and managed to get my hands on a 4 when it was available for a quick second. it was def. worth the wait. a gorgeous top.
-1,I ordered this top in white along with the meadow rue lace sleeve top. while they are the same price  they aren't even close in quality. this top is one of the sheerest tops that i have seen. the trim  pocket and the lace-up tie are made from sheer type material that was twisted and didn't lay right  and the tag sewn inside  was sewn with red thread and showed through  very visible. i don' t think it would hold up after many washes. i returned this one and ordered another color in the lace sleev
1,A sales associate handed these to me while i was trying other things on. i had never tried the hoxton before. i have found my perfect black jean! they are so comfortable and they don't stretch out like others i have tried.  i am 5'4 and i roll them a few times but i like that look. i am usually a 25 and that is what i took in these.
1,This is the softest shirt  super comfy  very baggy but i'd say true to size for the style. it is a bit thin and i'm worried how it will hold up  or would have given the full 5 stars. i'm not a usual fan of the turtle neck but this is so soft  i love it!
-1,I was expecting a lot more  but this was disappointing. the material is thin and the quality isn't great. it also hung loose  just too loose  as it runs very very large i returned it
-1,I wanted to like this so much. it's a great good girl dress  church dress. however  it makes no sense. it's a summer dress with massively thick lining that snags i'm petite and busty and it made me look and feel very wide.
1,Soft  silky  lined in silky natural fabric  hangs great without being weighty. extremely flattering on my xl short body. i'm petite  but for tunic dresses always order regular sizes  so they go just a hint over my knees--exactly what i need. lovely details: sequins and weighted tassels. highly recommend!
0,"I'm 5'6"" and it hits me at mid-thigh. the top (black/camel version) is sheer enough to need a cami. the waist is quite high. not flattering for me--the empire waist makes me look a bit pregnant--plus i don't want to deal with having to wear a cami."
0,My first complaint is  this dress is pinned back so obviously in the video that when the model turns around (not all the way)  you can see the pin in the back.  that should have been a clue that this dress isn't meant to fit anyone properly if it doesn't fit the model. i agree with another reviewer that the model in the still product photos sized up and up because the dress does not fit loosely in regular size nor is it that long.  you have to have a longer torso to pull off the top  or the fabr
0,Just a warning. i am always a 6 or 8 and even the 8 was so tight in the waist i could barely out this on. if you don't have a super tiny upper waist  this won't fit well. too bad  because it's super cute  if a bit sheer.
1,"It is a beautiful dress  light and delicate. i got my usual xsmall ( 5'4"" 34c  134 lbs). it comes with a slip and the slip is a bit fitted. it worked for me  but i can see this being an issue. it can easily be resolved with any other ivory or nude slip. it is worth it. very cute dress."
-1,An awful dress! retailer why didn't you post my last review. i would not even give it a quarter of a star.
0,I need t-shirts  these seem cute. a small runs loose  but it's comfortable and it does fit. i am turned off by the little side slits on all of this brand's printed tees. if i want to do a partial tuck to give myself a waist  because these shirts are cut generously  the little slits just throw the whole look off. i tried a few in the store  but left them all there.
-1,"I really wished i had heeded the other reviews of this ""dress"". it is so ridiculously oversized i cannot imagine who this possibly would look good on. i ordered the sm/med and when i took it out of the package i thought i had accidentally been sent a bed sheet and said ""are you kidding me?!""  by the time you cinch the neckline so the fabric is somewhat close to your body the neckline is almost to your waist and you look 50 lbs heavier. horrible design retailer. i don't know which dress the"

0,"I absolutely loved the idea of an elongated hoodie as a lounge dress or robe. unfortunately  this particular product left a lot to be desired. firstly  the fit is slim  not relaxed. i'm 5'4""  at 110 lbs and tried both the size 1 (equivalent of a small) and size 2 (equivalent of a medium). sizing up just added length and did not do much to increase roominess. they both zipped up easily but did not drape well. finally  the fabric was really not welcoming. i prefer terry over fleece  however this w"
-1,I own some pure and good cotton tanks similar to this in black that i live in teaching dance. i was hoping these would be the same. i ordered the pale blue and it is completely see through and fits tight in the back and loose in the front. i have no desire to have a bra/sports bra show whether out the sides or through the fabric  it is tacky!
0,I wanted to love this dress  the open back  the lightweight fabric  and fun print. perfect for spring and summer. it could be i'm too tiny for this dress  but the front of the dress wasn't flattering. it just hung and there was an odd tuck in the waist that made it look like it ballooned out under my chest above my waist.
1,Love this jacket. it's soft and a beautiful shade of ivory. perfect for casual wear with a pair of black jeans  while still maintaining an elegant look.
-1,I was so looking forward to wearing these pants on an upcoming trip. i already had my outfits planned! when these pants arrived  however  they were very different from those shown in the pictures online. firstly  the pants are  in actuality  quite cropped. i am 5'9-- the model in the pictures is at least that height  if not taller-- and the hems were several inches above my ankles. secondly  the pants appear to be an even wider cut than what's shown  although the width of the pant legs may have
-1,"This was not what i was expecting. at all. i am a medium in just about everything but ordered a large to possibly wear this as a dress instead of a tunic since i am around 5' 4"". the large fit like a small on me  and not like a typical oversized sweater type small  but a normal fitted top small. a previous reviewer said it is long and straight  and i think that is a good description for it. i think the models wearing this in the pictures are all wearing an extra-large #or a different cut of the"
1,These are a comfortable  flattering casual pant. i usually wear a 27 in skinny jeans  so i dropped down to a 26 to make sure they weren't to baggy. i love them and will wear the a lot!
1,"Button down shirts usually aren't my thing  but the soft fabric of this top makes it feminine and comfortable while still keeping that classic look. it's also easy to dress up or down  which is great! i am 5'4"" and small-framed  and the size 0 fits just right."
-1,This has such awful proportions. i'm 5'0 and 100 lbs  ordered xxs petite (in the neutral color). the seam at the bust literally hits in the middle of my bust!! it looks very unflattering  and it's very pronounced. i'm only 5'0 and already the seam hits at such a high point on me. below the seam the sweater is all scrunched up where it's sewed  and it balloons outward and is very square from there down. very shapeless sweater and not flattering at all unless you have your arms by your sides to hi
0,"Really wanted to like this top. the model has it on backwards - the ""v"" is actually the back and closes with an eye hook (that is where the tag is ? there's also a seam running down the back). the front is actually a high round neck. the material has a metallic thread and felt rather scratchy cheap. i'm usually a s or xs. in this top the s had too much material at the bottom and flared out strangely. the xs was too short in the front and moving your arms caused it to ride up."
1,I like this top. i received a ton of compliments when i wore it to work  but the material doesn't feel as high-quality as i had expected from the pictures online. it wasn't worth it to me to send it back  but i doubt i would have bought it if i had tried it on first.
1,The sleeves are small. should buy a larger size than usual. other than this is perfect.
0,This dress in coral is a beautiful color and awesome material. only problem is it runs a little big- i am a pretty true to size small and should've ordered an xs- the hips are a little wide and v in the neck a little low. instead of sending back i just wore a camisole and leggings w ankle boots and it looked very cute regardless.
-1,I tried this dress on in an xs petite. the dress runs slightly bigger  it sort of looked like a tent on me  whereas other xs p dresses at retailer fit tts. the other thing is that the dress just doesn't look like an almost $200 dress. the band that runs across the bust goes under the arms too. it isn't sewn in though  and it was folding down under the arms  making it look like its ripping off. the collar too seemed to pull down right in the center  as if the material was too heavy to stand it's we
1,True to size so great fit from top to bottom. i am 5'5'' and it hits my hips at just the right spot - not too high or too low. it also does not flare out too much so it will not give off the impression that you have something to hide in the tummy area. it is very soft and comfortable. the material is not fragile so it should be easy to maintain its shape after washing.
0,I was so excited to get this dress and could tell right away it was beautiful. the fabric and detail are perfect and seem great for summer. then i tried it on ....to say the bust area is tight and not proportioned correctly would be putting it very nicely. it was a total joke. this dress is for very small chested only.
1,This jumper is so cute  it is soft  and you can dress it up or down depending on where your going.
1,Classic retailer piece that i am so happy to have in my wardrobe. high quality all wool felt jacket. unlined  stretchy comfortable knit. i wear mine as a knit blazer and love it. it is not merino soft  but soft enough to wear over a long sleeve tee. the neck does not itch.     fits tts  i wear a l and that is my normal retailer size. i am tempted to get the cream as well!
-1,I was planning on wearing this at the office but it looks like a maternity blouse. not flattering at all. i loved the concept.. silky  loose fitting  professional.. but they didn't succeed. its a big mess. return.
0,"Beautiful sweater dress. nice texture gorgeous pattern. however not for my body type! i'm 5'5""  a size 12-14 and i carry my weight in hips butt & tummy area. this dress is only slightly a line  almost straight and even the xl didn't look flattering on me. and the arms are definitely smaller and weird too-there is bunching in the pit area. i tried on a large for comparison and it was too tight all over and there was a button missing too. this def. runs small and i think will be flattering on the"
1,This is a perfect outer layer for chilly mornings or nights. the detail on the back and sleeves is definitely retailer quality. the sleeves do run a little long though.
-1,I was very excited to order this top in red xs. so cute  but it was huge  shapeless and support thin! it had to go back. i should've looked at other reviews.
0,The material feels substantial and decent. however the diameter of the opening for arm is too big  it exposes good chunk of my bra. have to return it. there're also loose fiber of the fabrics  not sure if it is because it's new.
0,I really wanted to like these. they're soft  long enough for 5'8 1/2 and a nice color cut the rise is quite low and the hips puffed out in a weird way. have to return ;(
0,The material looked much nicer in the online picture. also- there are pockets which added a bulk to it that was not flattering on me.
1,This jacket has great style  is really comfortable  and looks good with jeans or nice pants. i usually wear a small or extra small in all clothes but thought the arms were tight in the small. the medium is a better fit.
0,I really like the dress  the material  the print and the pleated skirt are totally fun. however  the neckline is a bit to low  and a cami is necessary  at least for me. the material is very sheer  which will be noted on the sleeves and the lower skirt where the liner falls short ( about 4 inches above the knee).the main draw back i personally have with this dress is taking it off. there are no zippers or buttons. getting it on is easy  not so when taking it off!
0,"I tried this dress at the store and it made me look 10 years older. the fit was tts but a bit odd around the waist. i am 5'4"" and 160 lbs and tried a small."
-1,I saw this in the store and was glad i didn't order it earlier online. i thought it would be beautifully stitched but it was rather flat and unimpressive in person. i like more unusual and flattering pieces  and this just wasn't it. no compliments here.
-1,I own 4-5 other cloth and stone tops and always love the softness of the material. this one missed the mark. not soft and very thick. not what i was expecting.
0,"This is a beautifully made dress and i couldn't wait to put it on. i was disappointed. i am 5'5"" and a size 4- 6. i ordered the 6 and it was too 'long and heavy' looking on me. but the waist and upper body fit tightly. the zipper up the back was very heavy looking and the cut away shoulders didn't work for my body type  making me look bulky on top. the torso is really built for someone with small breasts - i am average and the way the darts are  made my breasts look flatter and lower than they a"
1,This dress is exactly what i was looking for. i have a very business casual job but wearing jeans and blouses can get boring so i'm constantly on the lookout for easy  go-to dresses that i can throw on year round with flats  booties  sandals  etc. this dress is exactly what i had in mind and i look forward to wearing it in the fall/spring with booties and in the winter with tights.
-1,Frumpy - looked like a nightgown on me; maybe  better on someone younger ...
0,I love the design and aesthetic of this dress but when i tried it on it was less than flattering on me and looked almost night gown ish:(  really sad because the material is gorgeous! i bought it for my sister instead because i know it will flatter her body type more than mine.  i'm rather full on bottom and top and it seems to look better on slender women.  the only complaint  is have is that the straps seem delicate. the actual material and fabric is crazy beautiful though!
-1,This is huge. i understand that's the style  but it looked like i was wearing my husband's size xxl. i tried to imagine a really cold day when all that extra fabric would be nice... but then it started to itch  and itch and itch!
0,"I'm 5'5"" and i think fairly proportioned (120 lbs  34b) and the peplum hit well above my waist. since having kids i'm a little obsessive about avoiding any shirt that could double as maternity... and this struck me as one. it's a cute too  but once it's on i don't feel it's very flattering."
-1,"Quality jumpsuit but poor design. the green made me look a bit like ""gumby the cartoon character"""
1,Love these pants  they do run small in the hip area and are not stretchy at all. so beware  if you are curvy  you might want to size up. great quality and style overall.
-1,So much extra fabric. not something i would recommend buying online.
0,This dress has gorgeous fabric and impeccable quality construction! i'm 5'4 118lbs and large busted (32. dd). i am usually an overall size 4 but when buying dresses usually have to purchase a six to accommodate my chest. i ordered a size 4 because that was the only size left and was going to take a chance . it fit perfect across the chest but the overall dress is enormous! does not even slightly silhouette your figure. it is like a giant stiff triangle. i was going to return but was so hesitant
-1,This was exactly the item i was looking for. simple  black  stylish.  unfortunately the fit is terrible and proportions completely off.  the upper arms  chest and hips were ridiculously tight and the whole look was uncomfortable and flattering.
-1,This shirt is beautiful. it is flowy and light  a perfect piece for transitioning from winter to spring. however  do not follow the washing instructions on the tag. it says you can machine wash  tumble dry low  and despite going one step further and washing on my gentle cycle in cold water and drying it on extra low  it came out of the wash so small that a child could barely wear it. it went from being a tunic to an inappropriate crop top i will never wear again. if you do order  please take the
0,"When i saw this  i ordered immediately thinking it was similar to the popular colorblocked stripe sweater from last year. the knit is stretchy and textured and feels like great quality (would wash well)  but it's pretty lightweight. the fit is huge...could easily size down. i'm 5'7"" 128# and found the small to be loose everywhere  including the arms. the length was at my knees  and the stripe fell awkwardly across my chest. no idea what i'd wear this with even if it fit better. sadly  it's going"
-1,"I was looking for a really warm  but stylish coat that i could wear when the weather is frigid as it sometimes gets here in the dc area. i tried on a size small  which is my usual coat size. while the coat fit  it was not flattering. for reference i am 5'9"" 128 pounds and usually wear a small/xsmall in retailer tops. in this coat i looked like a linebacker with pads on. the front material is doubled  which makes you look like you have a large protruding stomach. the shoulders are bulky and"
0,This dress was pretty but had a weird fit. the waist droops down in the middle instead of going straight across  which i found unflattering. i ended up returning it.
-1,I wanted to love this dress. the cut  fit and color are adorable. unfortunately the fabric is super thin. due to the material type it can be clingy in a manner that requires the anti-static spray your mom used to use in the 80s. i was on the fence of keeping it  but if there is so much as a wrinkle in your panty-line the whole world will see it. i would hate to have to wear a slip with this due to static issue. i am most likely going to return it; even at 15% off  it is over-priced for the cheap
1,Perfect fit  nice detailing best feature is that they do not bag out after wearing for a short time. good lines in back so they are more dressy than a regular legging.
-1,I was so looking forward to an awesome maxi dress.  this was not it.  completely see through.  i guess you could wear it as a bathing suit cover up.  but be prepared to knot the length or you will trip.  its an odd design. absolutely not worth the price.  i purchased the sm/md and i could have for two of me in the dress. returned this piece without looking back
1,Love these jeans! they are the perfect relaxed fit; not too baggy  and a straight style. i did size down  because i wanted to wear them as shown. i was afraid that they would ride too low on my hips. glad i did! i usually wear size 29/6 and took a 28 in this pair. the color and denim weight is also great.
-1,I really liked the look of the orange so ordered an xs. i prefer a s petite but it is sold out. the xs arrives and while i still like the color  the fit is really weird. the cowl is very high up but the sleeves are still long. it looks nothing like the photo. i cannot see how the cowl sits on the model's collar bone. despite eliding the color  the design is off so have to return.
1,Versatile and comfy. can be worn with shirts underneath for multi-seasonal wear.
0,Boxy  unflattering  and large.  i'm 5'2'' and a curvy 135 pounds. this top (size s) swallowed me  had no shape  and the material didn't feel great either. i wouldn't even purchase it on sale--there are other graphic tees that are much nicer. i'll be sticking to splendid and sundry.
-1,I love the way these jeans look and fit  but they have a chemical smell. i assumed the odor would go away after i washed them  but it doesn't seem to have helped.
-1,"I am absolutely shocked that so many people love this dress. maybe i should have sized up and reconsidered  but i still don't think it would have worked. the fabric is very soft but that's where it's qualities  for me  ended. the knot felt huge to me and definitely added unnecessary size to my already curvy hips. (for reference i'm 5'4"" and 125  hourglass. 32dd .) the cut at the bottom also felt very strange and restrictive to me  like i would have had to take smaller steps to walk around in it."
0,This top is much stiffer  more baby-doll and boxier than pictured. lining is stiff too  and colors more muddy than shown. i wear boho tops all the time and this looked terrible on me (i have broad-ish shoulders and a chest). i thought it would be a fun  drapey top for transition to fall but unfortunately it's going back.
1,"I really love these pants as ""loungers"". not sure i would wear them outside the house  because the legs are very wide.. yes  the elastic has the problem that others have mentioned  but i just hold it in place when i pull them on and it stays put. but the fabric is so soft that i put them on every night after work and sometimes don't take them off before bed. pockets are a nice touch - something i have come to love about retailer pants."
0,I wanted so badly for this dress to work on me. the design is amazing. the detail is so pretty and delicate. its my version of the perfect little black dress! however i have very big arms...and while i could have easily sized down for the body of the dress  the arms and chest in my normal size did not fit at all. i'm usually a 14-16 in dresses. i tried the 16 and it just didn't work. the arms were way too tight. however i've seen this dress on many other women with smaller arms than me  and they
-1,"I ordered the black & white  00 petite. i'm 5' 2""  96 lbs. and i order petite sizes all the time. the length for the size i ordered is about 23"" (on the back  from neckline) which is great for me; however  the length on the sides is way too short. the distance between the armpit on the blouse and the side hem is only 9.25""  so my skin shows on the sides all the time when wearing regular jeans. not at all the way it shows on the model. i would order 00  regular length  but then the sleeves will b"
1,Great quality and beautiful color! i wear size 6 and ordered s. got lots of compliments :)
0,This is a pretty top but the arm sleeves are scratchy. i have sensitive skin  and had to return it because of this. otherwise  it would have been a keeper.
1,I loved this top so much i bought it in both colors. i have not seen anyone complain about this  but on me  the mock neck collapses in and looks messy. unfortunately i returned both. i sew  and i do not understand why this happened.
1,This skirt fit  but is very body con. if you are not comfortable with such a tight fit  consider sizing up. overall  the design is beautiful and the fabric is heavy (hides bumps). i plan on ordering one size up  hoping that the waist is not too big.
1,This t shirt is huge. i am 5' tall  size xs and i am swimming in this xs. i'm trying a size down. it is meant to be oversized but this is extreme.
0,I bought these almost immediately after touching them in store; they were so soft i didn't even need to try them on to know i would love them. i now wish i had tried them on in the store  so i could have learned that the elastic band on the inside isn't sown in  meaning the band will constantly twist and get tangled whenever i put them on/take them off. it's unbelievably annoying. i have to fix them every time i wear them. if i had known this i don't know if i would have purchased them. they are
-1,"I agree with the other reviewer: the snaps at the ankle are a cute idea  but bad in execution. they look and feel odd when on. ---------- these fit tts  and they are soft with decent stretch. but the rise is much lower on me than other 8.5"" rise jeans i have; as a 43 year-old woman they seemed inappropriately low-hanging on me. ---------- as an aside  these will def. color transfer - there is a whole lotta rinse on these. and they have a strange chemical smell to them; not sure if that will diss"
-1,I didn't realize that the grey sleeves are attached (i assumed that was just an undershirt on the model). needless to say it looks cheap and poorly made. will be returning
0,Tried this on in the store - i love the colors but the cut was just not flattering. the liner was fine  but the dress flared out excessively and looked like a tent. tried it with a belt for some definition but the fabric was too thick.
1,I love that his blazer is soft and not so structured. so great for a business casual environment. the gray goes with everything and is already a staple in my wardrobe.
1,I found this top at the beginning of the summer and waited until it was on sale to snag it but honestly wish i had gotten it sooner and paid full price. it's perfect with navy shorts or white jeans and can dress up or dress down. it's a little bit short on the bottom but definitely still flattering. i would recommend it to anybody looking for something to throw on for an easy outfit. definitely worth the sale price!
1,This top is super flattering and comfortable. perfect summer wear!
1,Oh my gosh do i love this jumpsuit. i am so glad that i bought it. it is beautiful and fits perfectly. classy and beautiful and made in the perfect color. the design is slimming as well.there is nothing that i would change about it. i may be wearing this for my 60th birthday this month and am sure i will be getting it out for other occasions in the future. i love it.

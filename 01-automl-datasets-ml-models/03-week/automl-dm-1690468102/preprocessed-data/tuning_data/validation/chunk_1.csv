-1,I wanted to love this. couldn't wait for it to arrive.  unfortunately  it doesn't look anything like the picture.  i usually wear a m/l in holding horses so i ordered a l but as soon as i held it up i noticed it was ridiculously large. the fabric is on the heavy side so the dress just hangs in a very unflattering way. and  it is extremely shimmery.  i love velvet  but the texture and sheen of this dress was just over the top. sadly  it is going back.
0,I love this dress! the print and the fabric make it a fun  uncomplicated outfit choice that can be dressed up or down very easily. that being said  there are two issues i wish i had known about  although i probably would have purchased anyway. 1) it has pockets -yay!!! but also  the pockets create a bulge where they hit my hips and it's not a flattering spot on me to have an extra bulge. 2) i washed before wearing because it was super wrinkled and me and the iron aren't friends anymore. so i thr
-1,"I ordered this in a size 1 which i thought would be a small and it was very  very wide. it is very short too. i typically wear a small and am 5'8"" and 132 lbs. it's going back unfortunately. very soft material though."
1,I haven't worn it yet. i tried it on when i got it and like it alot
1,The print of this skirt is so fun. i love how it's styled on the model  and i could see it being very versatile. i decided not to keep it because  mainly  it is pricey and i'm afraid it'll get easily damaged. if i would wear it  i think i'd be worried about sitting on a dirty chair or spilling something on my lap and it being really visible-- and then having to upkeep it through dry cleaning. the fabric's nice and good quality. but honestly  if the skirt were cheaper and the fabric were cotton a
-1,I wanted this so badly  to wear as a dress over a slip. but it is not cute or flattering when you put it on. it made me look 20 pounds heavier than i am  and the fit was awful. i usually wear an xs in dresses at retailer and this swallowed me. i am petite but this is just waaaaaay too big. so disappointed because it's so pretty.
1,I love this shirt. it is great quality and hangs perfectly! please make more colors in this one. i would buy all of them!!
-1,From the photos  i thought the design was embroidered. in reality  it is stamped on. there is a tiny bit of embroidery and a few sequins  but overall  the design is just printed on the fabric. i didn't feel it looked good  in fact it looked kind of cheap to me  so i returned it. the overall style of the jacket was great and it would have looked equally good for work or casual. i was disappointed it didn't work out.
1,Love this shirt. great shape and lightweight material for hot houston weather. washes up nice but does need some ironing.
1,This dress is extremely comfortable. the dress is slightly loose under the armpits  but the other than that the overall fit is great. can be dressed up or down!
0,This is such beautiful material  but the sleeves at the shoulders are terrible -- the gathered material makes it look like i'm wearing shoulder pads. that structured element compared to the rest of the dress (relatively unstructured) just looks ridiculous. i was so looking forward to this dress  and now it's going back.
-1,This jacket was cute  however  i am normally a large with a bit of room to spare.  this has the irritating issue of not fitting under the arms and across the chest and shoulders.  it is not my shape as most other brands at retailer fit me. this jacket is not sized correctly.
1,This tee is so cute and well constructed. it's not a fabric that's going to wrinkle and pill eventually which i love. it runs tts and i like that it's thin but not to sheer that i need a camisole - just a nude bra!
0,I am a 10/12 and ordered the m/l. it's very large! i normally take a large in retailer  but i can't figure out my size in this. it's very wide. i love the denim patchwork detail so i will order the s/m and see how it is.
1,I didn't think much of this online but it was very nice in person. i was nervous it would look bulky but it was very flattering and slimming. fits tts.
-1,After the second wash  the stitching in the armpits completely fell apart. after sewing it back up  wearing it  and washing it a third time  the stitching in the other armpit completely fell apart as well. not sure if this was just a fluke  but it was very disappointing. now that both armpits are sewn and all other stitches are intact  i must say that this is a great dress. i would have returned the dress to retailer  but i've already washed and worn it  so again...very disappointing. i would say
0,Purchased this sweater as a gift for my daughter and when i saw it wanted one for myself. it is a light to medium weight and works well with jeans or for work. the sweater is shaped smaller at bottom and is flattering. the one problem was that when you raise your arms  the sweater also rises to expose your torso. it was returned.
0,I bought this scarf/dress for 20% off on mother's day weekend. i really like how it looks and can be worn over a bathing suit or just as a dress  but it is not worth the money. it is poor quality  a scarf stitched together with an attached chord that you tie around your neck. you can make this yourself or wait until it is at least 50% off the original price.
-1,I wanted to love this top -- looks so comfy and cute. but hangs like a bag. going back!
0,Looks beautiful online but has too much material and the zipper catches on the lace. also runs very large  i am normally a small but would need and xs in this dress
-1,While you can't count on the photo on your monitor to portray the exact color of an item  these photos are way off.  instead of the warm charcoal i see online  the pants are more of a dusty blue.  the material has very little stretch and i couldn't get into the size 24s.  the 25s were tight in the entire leg but huge in the waist.  for reference i usually wear a size 24 in brands like 7 for all mankind and citizens of humanity.
0,"I wanted this top in a petite xs  but it was sold out so i got the xs. i'm 5'2"" with a 34b bust  and while the bottom comes down to my waist like on the model  the sleeves are a bit long...they seem a little long on the model  too. i wore this to work and constantly had to pull my top back as the scoop neck kept drooping down as i moved around throughout the day. really like the tie neck feature though."
0,This shirt is so cute. i ordered a white  but will have to return it for a different color. the white is very sheer/shee through!
1,The color  heft  style & quality are perfect. i did go down one size since my usual size was too large in the waist.
-1,I agree with the other reviews - runs small. would have been perfect if it actually was comfortable. waistband doesn't stretch all the way around. bummer.
0,This dress is beautiful  made with high-quality fabric  unique design and color  etc.  but it fits so weird! i am hourglass shaped so this dress seemed pretty ideal  but i just couldn't make it work. it was heavy and awkward feeling when on  the clasp at the breast would definitely not stay closed long  and would undoubtedly need replacing sooner than later. the sleeves are too fluttery and long. the dress itself is just too bulky and has too much of that beautiful fabric. maybe a really tall  s
0,I am curvy and this top  while stylish and i love the pockets  just didn't do it for me. it made my shoulders look wider than they are  which is a big no no. it would probably look better on someone with smaller shoulders or slimmer. the wool was also a tad itchy - not too itchy  just a bit. in general i don't wear wool without cashmere  i also don't wear non-italian wool because it is a bit rough and my skin reacts to it. so i stick to wool cashmere blend or loro piana soft wool. this sweater s
1,Cute and comfortable top. very cute top that i will have to wait a few months to wear (until it is cooler out)  but a great piece to pick up for a nice price! it is soft and comfortable with a generous amount of room  but not where you look too big. i ordered it in the blue  but really it is like a dark gray ? which does not bother me.
-1,This is the oddest fitting pullover. there is too much fabric around the chest. it is fitted everywhere else but then balloons out in the front. i liked it at first but really started to dislike all the bunchiness (is that a word?). i gave it away..
-1,"These are very flattering thick leggings that would keep you warm in the fall and winter  but when i pulled them up i got a big hole in the seam at the waistband at my first trip to the bathroom! obviously you might expect a rip if they were too tight  but these fit perfectly (even on the looser side) and ripped effortlessly. pretty embarrassing given the price! bringing these back!     for reference ( if you decide to try your luck)  i am 5'7""  128# and my normal size s was perfect."
1,The photo doesn't do it justice. the detail on the neckline is adorable and looks fantastic with jeans. texture is light and gauze-y  but i don't find it too see-though. sizing was tough- i'm 5'10 but thin on top- usually between xs & s  and went with the xs on this (ordered both to try)  sacrificing some length for a more flattering width. great for the sale price!!!
0,First  i was surprised that this skirt fabric felt similar to men's tie.  it is a thick weight silky feel.  next  i was surprised by the cut.... i wear a 12/14 petite  and the waist of the large is at least a size 10 if not smaller.  finally  the length was really long.  i realize i am 5'2 and buying non-petite sizes  but the cut was high ankle on me. i like the pattern and ruffles of fabric  both are unusual and good for fall/winter.  but i did not like the rest.
0,I am normally a size 8 in dresses and bought this in a small. so if you are a smaller person  this would likely be a bit loose on you. the color was odd. i liked the navy blue  but the pink was a pepto bismol colored pink. i just felt like i would get sick of the color/pattern after one wear. the fit is cute and comfy.
0,Really liked the fan pattern and the cut was cute and flattering.  but the material is thin and all the edges are not finished and look frayed making the shirt look and feel cheap.  would have kept if thicker material and the edges were finished.  not worth full price
0,I love the colors of the teal dress  but i wish that the top only had one color. the design is cute but the construction is a little off. the transition from the top to the skirt seems to lay wrong or have a bit of extra fabric. sizing up or down didn't help. the top is lined but the bottom is very thin. the bottom should be lined too. not the best.
-1,I was extremely disappointed with the quality of this product. as soon as i put this tunic  the right tie loop detached from the garment. i could return it but the point of shopping online was to avoid the hassle of going to the store. the price of the item does not justify the low quality of the final product.
1,This could worn with anything. tank top  long sleeves  gloves  jeans and pants. very high quality material. will be a staple in my wardrobe this fall!!!
-1,This looked beautiful online  but the skirt isn't 100% silk - the strips of fabric have different fiber content levels  with most of them containing some level of polyester. parts of the skirt felt like plastic to touch  and one strip has a very prominent gold sheen that looks cheap. overall very disappointing - this is not at all the beautiful silk skirt that it appears to be online.  a definite return. i wouldn't even recommend this at first or second cut.
0,Disappointed in the quality of the dress. love the style and especially the colors. the fabric of the body of the dress is very very thin and just poorly made. the top bodice is more substantial. not worth the price tag of $148.00. dress does run short.
-1,I loved the look of this sweater on-line  but it just didn't work for me. the fit wasn't good enough. the style okay. the color fine. the feel  scratchy. overall  it did not work for my body.
-1,Loved these when i tried them on they fit well and were so flattering. i am a size 0/2 and 5' tall and have a 'bubble butt' and thicker thighs with a narrow waist i tried on a 24 they we a little tight on my bum and thighs but the waist was perfect  tried on a 25 and they were much more comfortable on my legs and worked on my waist as well. i thought all was good but after wearing them out for not even ten minutes they started slipping down constantly and loosed up around all areas especially my
0,Ditto to all of the reviews who state that this top is beautiful but runs small in the bust. i am a large or an xl so i ordered this in the xl. i'm a little broad and busty and it was too small/binding. this is a beautiful well made top for a certain body type.
-1,The design is beautiful but it was thick and too warm for a summer event i was planning on wearing it to.  also  the seam below the chest was uncomfortable.  needed to return
0,This is a really cute shirt. i love the design  color and everything about this shirt but the size. i am 5'1 and 105 lbs  i can usually wear an xs or xsp. the xs was huge and they were sold out of smaller sizes or i would have ordered one. this unfortunately had to go back.
-1,This colors and fabric of this dress are beautiful and i really wanted to love it but from the chest to the hips there is too much fabric and it give you no shape at all. it had to go back.
1,Soft and stylish - my usual large seems a bit too large  so i will try a medium.
-1,This looked so odd on me! i decided to give it to someone with a different body type and she found it really odd too. the sleeve are a bit too long to be short and they are tight at the bottom. the top is really large  as to be unflattering. perhaps it's just that it doesn't work on someone who is petite  but this one is a return.
1,Was hopeful this might work on my petite pear shape (i am 5'  probably 135-140lb; one to two sizes larger on the bottom) when i first saw online so went to store to give the regular size a trial run before ordering the petite size online. you can never tell with these flare dresses - some just make the hips look so much worse and haven't had a lot of luck with casual retailer flare dresses this season. first tried on the medium and fell in love instantly - was looking a little big but thought orde
-1,This dress is super bulky and unflattering. the knit is loose and see-through. looks like it was knitted by a five-year old. if you need a dress that adds twenty pounds then this is for you. back to the store it goes
1,"I just received this top in the mail and i couldn't be happier with how it fits and feels on. might have to wear a camisole under with a bit see through in front. it is very true to size and drapes beautifully with the back being very feminine. i am 5'6"" and the length falls just about the same on myself as does the model. i will wear with skinny jeans with the nice length working well with them."
1,This tee is versatile  soft  well made  and it washes/dries well. i love longer length and stripe pocket details. it runs true to size  and it is a beautiful dark navy blue. what more can i ask for?
0,"While i had high hopes for this dress to be my ""go to""  unfortunately o couldn't get passed how cheap the material felt. the cut and pattern both worked on my petite frame  however  the cut out pieces in front are not lines and exposed the top portion of my bra."
-1,The sleeves on this top always caught my eye every single time i was in a store. they never had my size to try on  so when a free shipping offer came up  i ordered the ivory top in a size large. well  the sleeves are indeed stunning  but that is all that is attractive about this top! the rest was a plain  blank  white canvas. in fact  that's what it felt like to wear it -- like i was wearing a tent or an artist's canvas on my chest. yuck! how can this designer put so much thought and care into t
0,This top has a great pattern that could be worn with many different things. it was a bit short for me  as i have a long torso  but i wish it had fit right!
0,I bought this in the grey as shown in the photo as i'm not fond of horizontal stripes and i felt the striping would distract from the floral accent of this tee. the gray is light and as pictured in the photo.    i bought an xl and the fit is tailored  with some loose flow to it. it is not boxy or big on me.    the fabric is a soft  soft  thin cotton knit and very cool for hot  muggy summer days....esp. in the southern us where it can be pretty intense. since i bought the gray  it's not sheer  al
-1,A good part of my closet is filled with retailer clothes. i mix them with my basics  scarves and jewelry. so  i immediately thought of a dozen ways this kimono could jazz up anything from skinny jeans to slip dresses  even though i felt it was pretty pricey. when it arrived  i was more than disappointed in the cheapness of the fabric. it does nothing for any of my intended clothes  so it is going back asap.
1,This top is really cute. the fabric is soft with a little stretch to it. the lace shoulders with the denim cutouts add so much to this top. i was afraid it might make it too stiff & bulky around the shoulders  but it doesn't. very cute. the armholes are cut on the bigger side  but not so big that it shows your bra strap or anything.(just comfortable) the cut is also very nice and the pleats make it more body slimming. runs pretty tts. i ordered my usual medium and it's not quite as form fitting
0,This top was a disappointment for me. it was beautiful but because of the material it is made out of  it will stretch out as you wear it and not regain it's shape. it is also a little heavy for day time during summers in the south.... but the weight of it was not so much of a concern as the ability to retain its shape.
1,These are great wear- anywhere shorts. they are not too long and not too short. they are very soft and comfy. i ordered a size 6 and after wearing them a couple of hours i found that i should have gone with a size smaller perhaps. i will still keep the 6's for wearing around the house .
1,I love this shirt. it's different than other summer tops. it's pretty much as pictured in terms of color and size  and runs true to size. on a windy day the front will come open  but only to your stomach.
1,Got these in the red brick color  and unfortunately had to send them back. these are really cute and i loved the color and pattern  but they ran very small  and the cut between the legs and hips was odd. this may not have been a problem had i gone up at least one size. best to try them on if possible.
0,I'm still on the fence about these. i realize they got great reviews but i thought they would be a bit thicker. they just feel too flimsy and too much like i'm ready for bed. i was looking for more lounge pants that i felt like if i needed to run up to the store on a saturday afternoon that i wasn't wearing pjs. i just can't get past that. they are totally cute but i was definitely looking for more summer lounge-wear.    i ordered the small which fit fine. i wear 4-6 in retailer pants. i got the p
-1,Material was a tad rough for my liking. the color did nothing for my olive complexion. given the price of this shirt (even with 20% off) i don't think it's worth it. if i'm spending $100+ on a blouse i need to love it and i do not love this one...going back.
-1,I loved this shirt until the first time i washed it. it shrunk so much it became unwearable. when i returned it the salesperson said she had also bought this shirt and the same thing happened.
0,I loved the fabric  cut and style of these shirts  the diamond gather in the front is a problem though. i just went under and snipped the elastic that is sewn on that design to relax it a bit. this shirt washes and wears wonderfully.   please make again   maybe fix the diamond area so it is not sewn with as much continuous elastic  a space in the sewing on both sides would alleviate that pucker.   sill i love this top
1,This dress fits pretty much how it looks on the model. the fabric is soft and the stripes are a goldish color. i bought this because of the other reviews and glad i did! perfect dress for work and going out. the petite hits me mid-thigh like in the photo.
1,I tried these on when they were full price and waited for them to go on sale and was very excited when they did! i'm not the type to buy leather pants but these look like i can dress them up or down and dress them like jeans. i'm a size 26 in pants but i bought size 25. i highly recommend!
1,"I love this faux-fur coat. i wear it both dressed up & down. i usually wear xs but bought s so i could wear sweaters under it and the arms would still be long & i'm happy i did (5'4"" 103 for reference). the faux is soft & comfy. it's warm  but not blizzard warm. i get loads of compliments on it when i wear it & ""where did you get that?""  definitely worth the purchase on sale."
1,This top is beautifully made  but comfortable. the neckline is a stretch fabric and the cut is very flattering. the length is just short enough that it doesn't look like a dress.

-1,"The title says it all. while the quality was good  when i put this dress on a felt like i was wearing a shapeless sack fashioned out of wallpaper. the length was longer than on the model (makes sense since i am only 5'5"")  which was ok  but the overall fit was just too big. i am a size 2 and tried the xs  which was huge. just not flattering or breezy or sexy in any way. going back!"
0,They are beautiful! they fit amazingly! they ripped on a seam the third time i wore them. i kept wearing them  because again  the fit! the style! alas  about the fifth time i wore them  the other leg ripped at the knee seam. they are just totally falling apart. it's so very sad. i would wear them alllll the time if they could bear it. i'm actually thinking of buying another pair because i love them soooo  but it would likely be wasted cash as i believe there is a real manufacturing issue here. w
0,"I ordered this on line. pretty  but ran large so returning. i am 5'10"" and 140lbs.  not large chested  and the m was too loose and looked frumpy. the sweater is a very soft  loose  knit that requires a cami underneath as it is slightly sheer. it was not quite as soft as expected for cashmere but good value at sale price."
1,I tried this top on in the store before i ordered it online. i'm a size 2/4 (varies)  and i ordered it in a size 2. i've been searching the perfect  fitted  white  button-down blouse for weeks  and i love this top! it's figure flattering  true to size  and a cute  classy alternative to your basic white button down. i can't wait to wear it! =]
0,I ordered the yellow color way expecting it to be a mustard color. it seemed to have a greenish tint to it and didn't look right on me. also the pockets didn't lay right so the flower didn't look right.
-1,I wanted this romper so bad  after buying (and loving) a shirt from madewell made with the same fabric earlier this year. i wish this romper was just a little bit longer and roomier. i normally wear a size 10 or 12 and bought the large. it fit me ok but i felt like i wanted it to be just a little bit more oversized around my hips and definitely wanted it to be longer in the legs. (retailer please stop with the capri lengths! it's tired!!) if you are narrow-hipped you will fare much better. the fab
1,"This jumper is gorgeous! i usually don't instantly spend almost $300 on one piece without contemplating  but as soon as i tried this on  i fell in love. i had to order it online because i needed the xsp as the xs in store was way too big. please be warned that this runs large and definitely buy the petite if you are petite or a little taller... i am 5'3"" for reference and even at 5'3"" it's barely short enough to not be too long on me. so if you are an inch or two taller  i would recommend the pe"
1,Love the color of this- a rich  dark green- it is super cozy and perfect to throw a long sleeved shirt under- it is roomy  not fitted. i ordered a small  then thought i should have ordered an xs - so then i ordered an xs as well. i go between xs and small  but because this is not fitted  the xs is perfect. material is nice- soft and super cozy.
-1,I ordered the coral/peach version in size 16. it ran small  especially compared to other size 14 or 16 maeve blouses i've purchased. very tight throughout the blouse. the product photos looked so nice compared to what arrived. the material was extremely cheap in quality. it wrinkled terribly. the bow pulled the material down which obscured the look of the eyelet. the idea of this was perfect for my style. unfortunately  the poor choice in material & poor fit made this a return for me.
-1,Even on sale sale...this tank is not worth the money. the design in the back is adorable & would expect it to be so much better quality but the fabric is flimsy(think old man white tanks that come in a pack) completely see through and lack of shape..i wanted to love this but definitely photographed significantly better than actuality!
0,I loved this top when i saw it online. i was able to go in the store and try it on and sadly  it is not the top for me. if you have a large chest  then this top will gather at your cleavage and give an awful appearance. the fabric falls in and even the sales associate agreed that it was unsightly. if i were an a or b  this probably would have worked. i should have known to stay away from a pleated top.
0,The dress arrived with two large buttons missing from the front complete with unraveling threads. the rest of the buttons are sewn on loosely  and in general  it's poor quality. ridiculous considering the price  very disappointed.
0,This jacket is extremely soft and comfortable  with a heavier textured fabric. i think it is expensive for what it is--$138--probably best to wait for a sale
-1,This shirt ran small and was more sheer than i expected. had to send it back.
1,This is a very well made top  i like the cut and it fits true to size. very nice quality and the colors schemes are unique. i'm happy with this purchase.
1,Love the design and colors  runs a but large through the middle
0,Loved the design and print of this blouse.  however  every time i put it on or took it off  i could hear the seams ripping.  definitely wasn't because it was too small either.
-1,In a sea of dresses  this is the one that caught my eye in the whole store. i am a pear shape  and ended up trying both the medium and the large  taking the medium home. it was super flattering on  and was an appropriate length to pair with tights.  here's where the problem happened. i wanted to wear this dress for thanksgiving  i put it on  and as i tightened the drawstring to cinch in the waist - riiiiiiiiiip! the drawstring ripped through the fabric at the waistband. so disappointed.
-1,Looked really cute on line. arrived with a large hole in the front! quality and look was very cheap!!! would not recommend this sweater at all. step it up please retailer!
0,I wanted to love this dress--a throw-on-and-go outfit that was casual enough with sneakers for errands but stylish enough with dressy sandals for a brunch date--but didn't for a couple of reasons.    first  it is way too short for me  especially on the sides because of the war the ruffled bottom lay  to wear as a dress. it was more tunic length- but i wouldn't want to wear pants underneath because it would take away from the overall aesthetic. also  the ruffled sleeves give me unwanted volume th
-1,"I bought this jacket based on how it looked on the model  and from the reviews. i found it to be super big  and unflattering to say the least. i'm 5""10  155lbs. i sent it back."
0,Bought in white. it has a ribbed detail that makes ir only for casual wear.  the white is pretty sheer. will return.
0,Love the design and style of this dress when i saw it online  however  it falls a little short once in person. it was a bit boxier than i wanted and the lines didn't make it appear as a swing dress  highlighting your figure.  i wish this could have worked  however  it felt a little too unshapely.
1,"I ordered this skirt in my usual xs. when it arrived it looked tiny. the xs was almost impossible to get on. i ended up returning the xs for a medium  which fit perfectly (and is work appropriate). my measurements are 5'6"" and 125. my recommendation would size up two sizes."
-1,This top is perfect for the first day at clown college if you want to see some clowns cry. the sleeves are probably the worst part of this overpriced monstrosity. the elastic at the cuffs makes the already comically large sleeves billow and puff out even more.     buy this if you enjoy walking to the post office to return things.
-1,I love the look and feel of the material  but it was way too short - i don't even have a long torso! sadly  it's going back to the store.
0,I had been eyeing this top for a while so i was so happy to see it go on sale! i was so excited that i went to my local retailer to try to purchase it right away. unfortunately this top did not fit me right. on the model it looks adorable  on me it was frumpy & ugly. the petite is sold out so i tried a regular medium (i'm usually in-between a medium & a large) & it fit me big & just didn't do anything to my figure. i agree with the other reviewers that the bow was too thin & flimsy & needed to be
0,Beautiful - ordered a s  i wear a 2 in most retailer items. hand washed in cold water  shrunk inches  yes inches! love maeve clothing  this shirt is gorgeous. before hand washing in the sink  it was large and flowy. now it barely fits.
-1,The fabric of this looks and feels so cheap it's hard to believe this is anna sui. i would say this is unwearable. there is zero stretch and it is made of itchy textured poly fabric that looks like novelty fabric at best. going back asap.
-1,I usually love tops like this  i bought this is the store because if was so soft. got it home and was so disappointed because it is not very flattering at all.would be a great house top though because it is soft enough to sleep in.
0,I ordered this online and was surprised to see yellow in the pattern when it arrived. i can't see that in the online photo. i didn't like the pattern at all when i saw it for real. the shirt is very loose  fits much like the model photo (i ordered a small  5'6 140lbs). just looks kind of frumpy and the pleat down the front makes the front hang heavily.
1,I really liked this top when i tried it on but as i wore it the bottom of the sleeves stretched out terrible where they looked worn out from wearing over and over  and since this happened with the first wearing and i paid $88.00 i sent it back. if it hadn't been for that it's a comfy and cute casual top
1,This shirt is very comfortable to wear  mostly because the buttons are well placed. many button down shirts bother me because they gape open at the bust area  but the buttons on this one are placed at just the right spot.
0,This shirt is really cute but a little stiff. it does come with a slip  but the slip was tight  but the shirt fit  maybe even a little big. i used another cami under which was better. i think think the sizing is off in terms of slip vs. the actual shirt. i got it in the store with the 30% off  so it was a good deal. it does stretch out as you wear it  so it will get bigger and it did make me look a little bigger  but still cute on and for a summer shirt  it's thin  so it does work well in that r
-1,Dress is much different in person. thin ribbed cotton.  a little tight for xl.    it looks like a throw back dress from contempos.  returned and would not recommend
1,I saw this in an email and loved it but by the time i tried to order it that evening  some sizes were already gone. the medium was back-ordered but didn't have to wait too long to receive it.. i especially like the design with the full skirt. the material is light weight  which is prefect for my florida climate. the design and fit were beautiful!!! i love it and will get years of use out of it. my only complaint is the material wrinkles very easily. i tried to get them out myself but ended up se
0,I loved the color of this shirt but it does run big. i even sized down and it was still large on me and the ruffles flare out a bit which was not flattering one me. it looks pretty on the hangar.
0,I had such high hopes for this  but the fit was really strange. i ordered my usual size small  but it is huge. the sides of the top are very wide and boxy  and the back hangs far from my body  very droopy. even if i got a smaller size  the design/fit is not for me. i like the linen front of the blouse  though it is quite sheer. the fabric on the back has a pretty design  but it appears to be stamped on thin black cloth  rather than the richly-colored fabric i saw in the picture. i am truly disap
1,The fun coloring of this tee gives what would otherwise be a basic tee it's flare. it is a very soft shirt and will be cute with anything. the length is good too - you can tuck in or leave out. i believe it is tts. it might be a little sheer in some lights  but i think you could pull it off with a nude-colored bra. it's not sheer enough to me to warrant an undershirt.
-1,I'm returning this jacket. i tried it on after it was delivered  and was happy with the weight  cut  and color  although it's more dusty mauve than it looks in the picture. however  the stitching and the zipper are of such poor quality that i doubt  it will last very long. i actually can't get the zipper to zip at all. it's very rough and lightweight  and i'm afraid if i keep trying to force it i'll just end up breaking it. sorry to say yet another retailer item turns out to be poor quality.   thi
-1,The fabric was nothing special (i usually like a cotton/silk blend woven fabric  but this was stiff feeling) and the pattern was cute. but what made me return it was the fact that 1) the rose gold glitter dots are puffy paint. literally. puffy. paint. and 2) the dots were not quite dry on my top when it arrived. parts of the paint came off on my fingers and the top was stuck to itself because of it. i could barely unfold it.  i'm sure this could have been cute  but who wants a top that looks lik
-1,Really well made. beautiful. sadly it is very short. not a tunic at all.
-1,This dress runs very large. i am 5'4 and 120 lbs  hourglass  curvy build. i ordered a size small and its enormous on me. the description says fitted but it is not fitted at all. it's like a big wool sack. i'd have to gain 30 lbs for this dress to come close to fitting. i'm very sad that the fit is so far off and the dress is now all sold out in all smaller sizes  including petite. (i never normally buy petite clothes but i think i would have to get a petite xs if it were available). the dress lo
1,"I had been eyeing the maroon one and i snatched it as soon as it went on sale. when i pulled it out of the package  i could not believe how soft it was. literally  as a cloud. think of the softest  fluffiest baby blanket. also  the cut is extremely flattering. i am 5'7""  135 lb and the medium fit me perfectly  flowing  but not boxy. love it!"
0,Runs a size big unless you want it really boxy. felt the matl was flimsy and would prob pill soon. turquoise was a pretty color but returning this one.
0,"I've been looking for some new  casual tops and ordered this one for the sky blue color. i'm a size 6 and the small fits great. i don't find the blowzy style overwhelming. i am small boned but i'm 5'8""  not a petite. i like it with leggings and skinny jeans ...a nice proportion. however  i can see how this cut may be too much on someone with a smaller frame. i really like it  however i see two drawbacks: the material is a bit thin for fall and it wrinkles very easily (not good for travel). this"
1,Gorgeous skirt. runs a bit big.  well made. perfect for the office and super comfy.
0,First comment about this piece is that it runs unbelievably small  which is not in line with most retailer pieces. i had to size up two sizes to get the size to close  on top of being busty. the material is thin and mildly see thru  but i think the shape it cute and it had a unique look to it with the tiny gold buttons and non-collar top. i decided to keep it.
-1,The material is very nice. not flimsy at all which is nice. the problem was the fit around the arms. i am a petite person with a small chest but it still didn't cover me bra. i'll be returning it.
1,This skirt makes me look at least a size smaller. i love it! the sa was wearing it in the store and it liked great on her as well with just a plain white top. tts- got my usual 10 in green.
1,"Perfect light weght sweater for the holidays. i love the detail in the back. the xs was a great fit for this 5'2""  115 lb body."
0,This shirt had everything going for it - the cut  the length  the fun texture  but when i stepped into the light it was totally see through. i don't want to have to wear another shirt underneath. this one is going back. definitely not a swing  but still cute.
0,I saw this jacket and loved the plaid and the idea of a soft sherpa material as a lining was hard to pass up1it was true to size and the material was very nice. however  the button closure was difficult as the buttonholes seemed a bit too small. also  the back of the jacket did not lay flat and it kept rolling.... i had to return this jacket.
1,This blouse has a nice casual feel with feminine lines and the swingy design is flattering.
-1,While i thought it looked really pretty on the hanger  when i tried it on it just felt like a mess. perhaps it suits other personalities and bodies. i hated that the zipper was in the front; i personally find it tacky and gawdy. while the patterns are pretty  the material felt like some weird fabric wallpaper and i didn't see how the price was justified with how the material felt cheap to me.
-1,No  but i'm not a small person. i'm 5'8  a size 6 on top  8 on bottom. i don't love this on the model online  but i saw this on naomi's blog  love taza  and thought it looked amazing. i tried it on in my retailer  and while they only had a m/l  since i'm tall  i figured that'd be fine. oh. no. not fine. it's huge. like  it could almost cover a twin bed. it was a couple inches longer on me than on the model  and doesn't arc down in a drape nearly as well  so just looks  huuuge. i thought i was bein
0,This is a well made blouse with a pretty neckline. the print with the sleeves makes me look really wide. it's an odd look.
1,Surprisingly  this poncho is both flattering and soft. i must say i didn't think the fabric would be as soft  since a lot of knits have wool  but this is great.  i purchased both xs/s and xs/s p.  the petite was just slightly more fitted  so i went with that. i love the boat neck  on me  it gives the poncho an elegant look. colors are nice and neutral.i  think i will wear this with dresses and jeans  both. great purchase. (115 lbs  30dd  26.5 in waist)
1,To my surprise this sweater is heavy  chic and stylish. its well made and fits tts. i'm looking forward to wearing it. i would recommend this tunic to everyone. it looks better on me than the model.....event though it doesn't look bad. you need curves to enhance the look of this tunic sweater. i really like all the different textures in this sweater.
1,This dress is a great casual outfit. tha fabric is substantial and very soft. the only negative would be it is a little large through the chest/arms. i ordered a large as i am curvy but would like to exchange for a medium. sadly the medium is sold out but i love the dress so much i am keeping it!
-1,The neckline is very tight and itchy. the arm holes are deeply cut. the length is not as long in person as it is on the model in the picture. it's short-waisted. it's too bad because the embroidery is very pretty.
1,"This tunic is a great way to wear the plaid trend right now without it being the traditional collared shirt. it's fun  comfortable and has great style. the first time i wore it i got tons of compliments! i'm 5'8"" and the back of the shirt goes to the back of my knees  i usually wear a size 12 and the large fit great!"
1,"I've been looking for white beach shorts and these are perfect! as another reviewer said  they are in fact see-through -- because they are meant to be a cover up  not ""real"" shorts. the hem detail is very cute and they're super comfortable! my size small fit tts  and the 3"" hem is nice for tall women."
1,This is a great staple top for your closet. its tremendously soft  a bit oversized  and drapes really lovely. in store there were also striped styles available  but i love the emerald green. the colors are absolutely perfect and will transfer well into any season! my only issue with this top (which inevitably is the reason i decided not to purchase) is the dolman sleeve. i'm al xl on top...so i'm never looking for extra width in anything i wear. the dolman sleeve really only looks right on me if
-1,"I'm 5""0"" and weigh 105 lbs. i purchased the xxs and it was super-wide  and big all over. it looked like a pregnancy top and did not lay as nicely as shown on the model. also  not shown on the model is the front is short and the back is very long. this would work better on a taller person. i just find it odd that a xxs is still too big. the quality of the fabric and the print is good and the lace-up in the back is cute."
1,This top is my new favorite. i ordered it on a whim  and oh boy am i glad!! i was so excited for it to be shipped to me  and once it arrived i couldn't wait to put it. once i put it on  i couldn't wait to show it off! it is such a great bluish-grayish color and looks great with some big hoop earrings  shorts  and sandals. such an easy  classic  simple shirt that i will probably wear too much.
-1,I loved the cut of these pants and the button accent on the pockets. however  the material was quite thin and the quality was not great- there were multiple snags along the seams. additionally  at 5'8  130lbs i was swimming in the size 4. i would have tried sizing down if the quality was better.
-1,This is a beautiful dress. however  it looked awful on me. i ordered the medium and it was huge. also  i looked 7 months pregnant. not a good style for the short person.
1,This dress is so pretty and the petite fits great in the arms and the length is good- just above the knees. the material is nice- not flimsy. i'm just not sure if it looks right on my petite  straight frame. the front is cute but the back is pretty baggy and shapeless. i've never worn a shirt dress so i'm not sure if this is how it's supposed to look? i tried it with a belt but it doesn't seem to work with this dress as there's a band of loose elastic. probably would look better on a curvier bod
1,I'm 5'9 and wear a size 12. this dress runs tts though there is no stretch to it  found the bust to be a tad tight (38c). it is light with good movement. i did not find it short waisted and i thought the proportions were correct. the length was just long enough to make me feel comfortable wearing it. i'm looking forward to wearing it to holiday dinners this season.
0,This dress is cute and i will wear it to work. i only decided to keep it because i got the sale price and an additional 40 percent off. the print is cute  but a little bit odd  it's a swimmer in a cap. the tie is fun.
0,There comes a point where i have to draw the line with things i purchase... i ordered this as i didn't have a black skirt  but thought ti wasn't special enough  don't get me wrong  it fits nicely  and is comfortable  but i was wowed. 0p or xs p fir perfectly  26.5 in waist and 115 lbs. if you want ta nice casual skirt  the sale price is a good fir for the skirt  just wasn't enough for me :-)

0,This is a very pretty top - flowy w/o making you look larger  a nice blue  and a good transition piece. but  the upper arms are so tight on me! i'd say i have pretty average arms - definitely not super thin  but not large either. i keep staring at it and hoping the fabric will give a bit so i can keep it  but sadly  i just don't think the material will be very forgiving. if you have truly thin arms  i think it would be a great top. maybe sizing up would also work  but for me at least  i think it
-1,After readying the reviews of this dress  i thought for sure i was purchasing a winner. boy  was i wrong! first  this dress feels like a potato sack and looked like one on. i felt that it was very boxy and more of a o' one size fits all' sizing. it did not embrace my curves at all. the material was not as chic as i would have thought. overall  the entire dress was not flattering. honestly  i do not understand what the rave reviews were talking about it.
1,It is beautiful  but not practical for me - the student who carries a backpack ! i didn't notice it doesn't have sleeves  it is regular poncho  soft and stylish . recommended for poncho lovers !
1,Love! this tank?everyone should own it in every color?it is soft  has a great shape  and is super cute. it goes great with so many of the pants/shorts from retailer as well. summer staple for sure.
1,"I ordered this top from store. i'm 5'3"" and 114 lbs  i ordered size 4  fir very nice  just front is little to low for me  but i wear ten top   it will be fine. the style and material are amazing  love it!"
1,"I saw this online and ended up driving over an hour to pick it up from a neighboring retailer store that had 1 more left in my size! it fits true to size for me with the waist band fitting my 27"" inches perfectly with no real give- so keep that in mind. the top does seem a little blousey  which i typically avoid (34d already) but this was still super flattering. overall it is a gorgeous dress that looks good on- one of those dresses that makes you feel good wearing it!"
-1,Purchased this in two colors online. purchased in an xs - i am usually a s or xs. the fit was really large in the xs and the seam on the front of the top was in the wrong place and was really unflattering. returning both.
0,This was my absolute favorite top before it transferred dye onto the driver's seat in my car. >:-( there is nothing in the language of the care tag which advises to wash before wearing because of the possibility of dye transfer to other surfaces. the care instructions say that is is washable with like colors and  in fact  recommends dry cleaning. really? and dry cleaning will remove all of that excess dye? don't think so. after i discovered the dye transfer on my car seat  i washed the top in a
0,"I ordered this dress in small  my usual size (for reference: 5'7""  125 lb). it is too wide. it looks more fitted in the pictures and hangs loose on me. the belt does not help much; it still looks like a sack and i feel like a girl wearing her mom's dress.    also  i found that the material crumples easily."
0,This dress is very pretty colorwise  but the fit did not work for me. i could see this working on girls with narrow hips  but it didn't flatter my narrow waist/wide hip frame.
-1,I found that this dress ran very small. i am true 8  ordered a 10 and it was snug
-1,This item is pretty  the print on the fabric is nice and reminiscent of embroidery  but only the top portion has a few embroidered accents. my issue with it is it's very impractical. the fabric is extremely thin  and you wouldn't want to wear it in any weather below 75 degrees. it's ridiculous to advertise this product for a fall/winter season. the tube top underneath doesn't work very hard to stay up  and isn't a very practical way to hold up the jumpsuit (why wouldnt they just stitch a lining
1,"I am 5'3""  130b  small waist  wide hips. dress fits perfectly  a little longer than i had expected (hits about mid-calf on me). great quality corduroy  nice medium green color. very unique  sort of vintage feel piece."
1,I haven't worn a pair of levis in ages  and had forgotten how great they are. i have recently lost weight and i have to say they are very flattering. i wasn't sure at first how i would ilike the frayed hems  but they are growing on me.
1,I'm 5'1  100lb and tried on pxs  ps and xs. the portions on the petite are perfect for petite sizes however if you are a d cup  keep in mind that you cannot wear anything thick underneath it if you go with the fitted size. the sleeves are pretty slim in the petite xs too. i'm keeping the pxs skirted trench because it looks like a dress from the fifties (fitted and flared) and looks so cute unbuttoned (like on the model). also  unlike some trenches there are minimum details (like epaulets  contra
-1,I made the mistake of ordering without checking the reviews. cute design but not as comfy as it looks. returned immediately.
0,I ordered this dress after seeing it styled with a beautiful cape.  when it arrived  it was incredibly soft and the color was a pretty  muted pink.  however  once i put it on  it clinged to all the wrong places.  having a larger chest made it show a lot of cleavage and if i can't wear a standard bra with it  it's too complicated.  in a regular tank dress  it would have been a yes. overall a great dress  but probably for another body type.
0,I loved this vest from the moment i saw it. sadly  though  it runs way too large. i first ordered it in a small and then an xs when it popped back. even the xs was too large around my shoulders and waist. the color was also a bit more beige than in the photos  which was ok  but i had to return it because of the size.
0,I was so ready to love this dress but it runs extremely small - like you should maybe purchase a size 2 sizes bigger than what you normally wear.
-1,I was so looking forward to receiving this in the mail! when it arrived  i was very disappointed. the color is more mauve than dusty pink  and the fabric is stiff and wrinkled.....not at all what i expect velvet to be (flowy and soft). the fabric seems very cheap for the price point.  i usually like floreat  but this one is headed right back to the store!
1,I love the tiger print. its subtlety is the perfect added quirk to an outfit.
0,I love the cold shoulder trend  and this top seemed to satisfy. i bought it in the blue  which is really more like a very light mint green. however  i think the material is pretty thin (though soft)  and the keyhole sleeve area  right by the twist  is not substantial so it looks a little cheap. i ordered the small  but i think i could have definitely sized down to the xs (110 pounds  32dd). it's very loose fitting but i wouldn't say it looks bad. it's just a very relaxed fit. for the price  thou
1,"These cuff jeans are very good looking! 4 stars bc of price. they run small too. i wear 29 in pilcro for ref and these were best for me in a 31. the rise is very short so if you are tall  beware. i'm 5'9"" and the 29 i tried was super uncomfy in the crotch area. i haven't worn them all day yet so they might stretch a bit."
1,"This romper is fabulous! i bought it in lime  and the color is great and perfect for summer. i do agree with the other reviewers that it's hard to get in and out of the sleeves (hence giving it only 4 starts for quality#  but the struggle is worth it. the fabric is lightweight and silky  so it feels cool and soft; it feels like wearing pjs. it's also very flattering with the bow just at the waist; it hides a not-so-flat tummy. i'm 5'4""  between 135 and 140  and curvy #very busty specifically)  a"
0,Very soft material  length is great  a little more loose than i would have liked.
1,The material is a medium weight jersey knit that is slightly thicker so it provides enough coverage and support to be flattering without being bulky. i think this dress is true-to-size  or maybe runs a little bit big  but only by a little bit. i bought a medium and am a size 8 in tops and 10 in pants. the dress hugs nicely on the upper body (arms  chest  ribs) and flares just a little bit on the hips/tummy/butt area. it is forgiving of little bumps or lumps. the scoop neckline is a bit lower tha
0,I was very excited about this dress but when it came i saw it had too much going on. it either needs the ruffle taken away ( my first choice) or the halter part taken away. in the end i think it needs to go back.
1,Picked this up at the local retailer in both colors. the red version was styled in the store with the adorable blue snail cardigan - which i also bought. highly recommend.
-1,The color is completely off! i loved the way this vest looks in the picture! i was excited to have that vest but unfortunately what i received in the mail was a huge disappointment. it came wrinkled and the brown is not as rich as it is in the picture. very pale. horrible.
1,"I would never have bought this top from the online photo but happily came across in in my local store. i bought it in the hot pink gingham check and it is so cute and fresh. will work well for hot summer days when i may want to wear rolled up sleeves as it is very lightweight and gauzy. i bought my usual xs/0  (5'7""  32b  115lbs)  and whilst it is looser on me than the model  i would still say that it is tts - maybe a little fuller in the back than i would like  but i will wear mine partially tu"
-1,Thought i would splurge on a tracy reese coat. i got a size small  (120  5'6) felt huge on me and i looked like a wooly mammoth. very unflattering. another reviewer also mentioned on how it flairs slightly at the bottom?.adding to the overall bad look. i had it on for about 20 seconds and put it back in the bag to return. din't have to ponder about it at all.
1,"I bought these pants expecting to lounge around the house in them. but once i tried them on  they were so figure flattering that i wore them to an outdoor dinner party (paired with a black tank top  silver accessories  and wedges) and got compliments galore. i still wear them to lounge in (they are super comfy) but they are also my emergency ""oh we're going out tonight  honey?"" pants. the only downside is that they need ironing when you pop them out of the wash (unless you are using them to loun"
1,"I love ag for their soft  stretchy denim and flattering fit. bought these today and couldn't be happier! i usually order stevies in the petite ankle size  but the ""regular"" capri length fit perfectly skimmed my ankle."
-1,I read the existing reviews  before purchasing  and a few mentioned that this sweater ran large. this has been my experience with most tops i have purchased from retailer. i figured by ordering a medium  i would receive a slightly loose to moderately loose fitting sweater. this was not the case! the sweater is short  does not look anything like it does when you view the model from behind (and i assume the model is taller than i...as models are usually tall). for reference  i am 5'6''  medium build
-1,When you look at the online pictures of the navy colored dress  the stripes are diagonal. however  that is not the case with the dress in person. the stripes are all horizontal and not that flattering. such a bummer because i love maeve dresses and thought this would be a great addition to my summer dress rotation. alas  not very flattering  so back it goes.
0,"I was wondering whether to purchase this top and decided last weekend during the 20% off event  i would splurge!!! i got the m as i'm tall (5'10"") and it does look a little strange on the arms atleast on my body. the sleeve is cut too high for me. i wish it was longer or even a long-sleeved item! the peach-apricot- nude colored fabric is a little uncomfortable and the fabric close to the neck is a different grey from the other sweatshirt pieces. the sweatshirt pieces aren't particularly soft eit"
0,These are my first paige cords/pants and they seem to run much smaller than the other brands i wear. i'm normally a 32 in all other brands but with these the waist is pretty tight. i do love the length (i'm 5'9 and they are plenty long.) i also love the bell/flare. i'm not sure what makes this brand so much more expensive as the quality though nice seems comparable to cheaper brands.
1,The color is a very dark mustard yellow  thin/light-weight material  and it has a pretty feminine drape. 0verall a nice twist on a classic plaid shirt. cute cuffs (complementary design). the top was baggier than the bottom though- i deducted a star for the tight fight on the hips. all photos show it unbuttoned or tucked in. i'm usually between a s/m  i recommend the size up for hip fit.
0,This is a relatively cute top when you try it on. however  i don't think it will hold it's shape after even just 1 wear. it also doesn't seem like you could wash it without ruining it (like a shirt form a 'throw-away' cheap clothing store). i checked the fabric tag and it is a very high % viscose - meaning  it won't last long at all. i'm returning and feel frustrated with how cheap the fabric is.
-1,"Perhaps i have gotten too used to flowy shirts  or the cut of this was not right for me  but it felt too fitted around the rear end and the shoulders didn't lay right on me. sizing up would have only made it too big in the shoulders so i returned. i am 5'5""  135lbs  34c  curvy/muscular frame and ordered a size small."
-1,I read all the reviews about the fabric being see through  but liked the dress enough to give it a shot. it is soooo see through. this trally could only be worn on a beach. very disappointed.
0,This is a bit more jacket-ish than i expected. the material is kind of scratchy  and it was heavier than expected. it has a lining in it  like a jacket lining. i wasn't a fan of the clasps on the front. i guess they are meant to be invisible  but they are literally little metal clasps. it is more cropped in the length than i expected  and i don't have a particularly long torso. i like the embroidery. the pattern is lovely. the fit is about spot on. i am about a 12/14 with a 38c bust and the l fi
-1,The title says it all....this fabric of this top is both the best and worst part of the design. the colors are vibrant and the combination of materials (shoulder is a knit  sweater-like navy fabric) is interesting. however  that is where the positive comments end on this one. the top is so scratchy   stiff  and  frankly  uncomfortable. i cannot imagine wanting to wear it. it could benefit from a lining  and that might have solved the problem of scratchy  itchy fabric.  the stiff fabric of the bo
-1,The idea of this shirt is awesome! it just needs to be made longer and not so boxy. the ruffle is darling! i would be so happy if the the designer made some modifications. i think a lot of people would buy it then.
0,Disappointed with the fit and color of this sweater. more of a rusty red then bright cherry red. i ordered a small and found the sweater had no shape and just hung lumpy on me. i am 5'5 120 and usually a small in retailer sweaters.
0,This cardigan is very soft and feminine. it looks nice on but it sheds everywhere. i decided to pass on it when it got white fur all over the other clothes in the fitting room. if you don't mind the shedding then i would recommend this sweater.
-1,Lovely colors and print. my problem with this dress was that the bust was on the smaller side (it will fit those with a smaller chest nicely!)  and worse  the beading on the bodice was attached with black thread  which showed through the sheer netting layer on top.     for the price  this particular detail should have been addressed.
0,I really liked the fabric and look of this top  but i was swimming in fabric.  there was so much that the top felt heavy.  i returned it.
-1,I own two poodles and love anything poodle print. i was estatic to see this and i snagged it on sale. but it is horrible. the fit is like wearing a pillowcase. it was about 5 inches too wide on each side while the arms fit. it looked like it was attempting to have a dolman shape but it was way too short  wide  and wrong. i was in love with the print however i had to return it.
-1,The skiers  cats  and puffin patterns are adorable and i was very tempted to keep the shirts just for the patterns. unfortunately  the fit was awful. i am short and need to highlight my waist and this shirt did the opposite. the skier fabric is also see-through. the tenting issue could be fixed if you belt the shirt or tuck it in  but it is not very long. 100% rayon fabric is a bummer too. the shirt was snug at the bicep  but not as bad as i expected from the reviews. i sized up from an 8 to 10.
1,I had been admiring this dress for over a year and finally treated myself to it for the holidays. first  it is gorgeous and very thoughtfully designed to make you look amazing. where things fall off the rails for me is the fabric choice for the sleeves...they are sooo delicate and evidently snag far too easily. the dress that i received in the mail had two large snags (one in each sleeve) that were already running a bit. to me that was a huge red flag that i shouldn't be spending so much money o
1,Been wanting a pair of high waisted sailor pants for a while and these are perfect! love the fabric . will be able to wear these in the spring  summer  and into fall. bought the 2 petite and the fit is perfect. nice drape and figure flattering. even the petite runs long and will have to wear with a high heel rather than flats. bought the black and thinking about purchasing the white pair as well. very very nice and i am very happy with this purchase.
-1,Loved it online for its modern cut and print. however  when i received the item i was disappointed. i ordered my usual size 4 and i was swimming in it. i like oversized things and understand that this dress is made that way; however  this was not flattering. i would say i would have needed to size down to a 0 and perhaps it would work but i didn't want to take another chance. the material seemed almost crepey  which i wasn't neccissarily expecting either. bummer that it didn't work out.
-1,I am always on the hunt for a cute white t-shirt but this one was a miss. it is too boxy (short) and the material is very thin for the price. i gave it two stars because it has nice colors for spring/summer. for reference  i am 5'4 and 115 lbs and i ordered a small. bought it online so i ended up returning it to the store.
0,I am on the fence about this top. i like the color but i'm not sure what to make of the style. the top part of it  around the chest and straps is lovely and flattering  but the bottom flairs out way more than i like. the back is longer than the front and it's almost a pregnancy top in how much it flairs. it's also quite thin and flimsy material given how expensive it is  even with the tag sale. the color  pattern and the chest part of the top is nice enough that i may keep this one  but  as i sa
1,"Beautiful  washes well in a garment bag on delicate. has little clips in the shoulders to hold bra straps which is crucial with the scoop back if you have sloped shoulders like mine. i normally go for a large  but was definitely a medium in this dress. 32"" waist  32f bra    only minor complaint is that the pattern (at least on the red  though probably also on the others) is just printed on the outside and the inside is faded almost white  so since the sides of the dress are slightly longer than"
-1,I ordered the dress on-line. this dress looked pretty  the material was soft and comfortable  the length was perfect  but the zipper was totally out of place. it bulged out in a weird way which made it look like the dress was torn. i had to return the dress. i normally don't see a problem at this level in retailer clothes.
1,Super cute dress - swingy  flattering  easy to wear. the pattern is great  and i felt like it was the perfect length for me - though i'm short  so it may be too short for someone taller. the dress runs big. i'm usually a 6  but i got this is a 4. only complaint is that the pockets add unnecessary bulk.
0,I'm keeping these shorts because they are cute. i sized down as the previous reviews suggested and they fit great  but they are snug around the legs. i think i would have preferred a more baggy look  but then they would have been too big around the waist (had i ordered my typical size). they are soft and comfortable  the navy color is really pretty.
0,I wanted to love this top. it was huge and i didn't like the material. it felt like it should have been much less expensive than it was.
-1,I too will be returning this sweater. love the style  shape and fabric  but after one wearing it has pilled terribly and now looks old and cheap.
0,Cute dress- flattering and seems to be well made. however  when i received it it seemed that it had been worn. the bottom was all dirty and it had a white mark at the top. called and rep said they would send new dress if i send first back  so hopefully that gets here quickly and in good shape. the other dress i place with my order hasn't even shipped and the rep couldn't tell me when/if it would.
0,This is a cute top  but not worth the price in my opinion. i love the colors  pattern and soft material used. however  the fabric is quite thin and just not worth paying $58.
0,I love the way that this suit looked  however i found that it was lacking in support. i was disappointed to discover upon trying it on  that it just does not cover my butt. it fit elsewhere just fine  but the slim cut up the sides left it a little too revealing for my liking. in addition i found the top to be awkwardly fitting around the chest area. i am a 34b and ordered a small and it seemed to be too baggy at the top.
1,Very pretty dress but the fit is not great. i have to get help to take it off because it's tight in the shoulders.
0,I ordered the skirt online and when it arrived i loved the fit and the aesthetic of the skirt. i usually wear a 0/2 bottoms and sized up based on comments- it fits great could maybe even have taken a 6 to have a looser fit.  i was however very disappointed when receiving the skirt to see that the material was already highly snagged- how is that possible if coming directly from the warehouse? i'm hesitating to return because i consider it already damaged based on the current condition and if it's
-1,"I wanted to love this top  but when i received the picture on the website is a dark charcoal almost black and the ""grey"" that you order is much  much lighter grey. in addition  this shirt is super boxy... thus why the model probably is pinning her elbows to her side to bring the top in. going back disappointed."
1,First i found the picture of this blouse stunning because the colors caught my attention . with that said  i found myself thinking of all the many events this could worn to  dressed up or down. so.... i found myself ordering it asap  paranoid that others were thinking i was thinking the same thing. well   i received it in the mail   and it was better than i thought!!! the colors and cut of this blouse is just as in the picture. i personally love this article/pattern of art  as i see it as an exp
-1,I loved the way it looks on. fit tts. only problem for me was it was so itchy. there is that small amt. of wool in it. if you have any problem with wool this may not work for you
1,These pants are a life saver. i love to travel with them and have washed them in a hotel sink  rolled in a towel  and hung dry with good results. picro does not usually fit me well  these pants are the exception. i'm 5'6 and if i uncuff them they can be worn as regular length. great for a baseball game! i will panic if retailer ever changes or discontinues them!!!!
-1,I tried this on in my regular size and was able to get it on fine  but the cup portion of the suit was just crazy! with the straps tied tightly around my neck  it was like the cups just flipped out and open. i am a regular b cup  and i don;t think it was sizing (though i did not have the opportunity to try multiple sizes). the cup did not right and  for this reason  would make this absolutely impossible to wear. unfortunate  because the design is so pretty.

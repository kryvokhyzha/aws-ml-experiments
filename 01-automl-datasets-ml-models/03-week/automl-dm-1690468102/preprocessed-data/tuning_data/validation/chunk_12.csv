0,I ordered 2 dressed in 2 different sizes. neither fit... both were very tight... runs very small.
1,I loved this but didn't realize it has mohair which agitated my contacts. i had to return it. if you don't have that problem  this goes great with leggings or jeans.
1,Lovely top that seems to flatter all body types. fit is great  fabric is soft  style is lovely...great to dress up or throw on with jeans.
1,I am 5'1'' and most normal size retailer tops are too big on the armpits and neckline for me.  i don't usually go for peplum  but i was drawn to this top bc it was very soft. when i tried it on  everything fit just perfect and length was also right for me. i like slight stretch of this fabric which hugs body nicely. i would say you should get a size that fits nicely on chest area.
-1,"Nice fabric  great color  would be lovely ... on someone with a straight-and-narrow body type. for ladies with curves  take a pass--too much like maternity wear  and not in that elegantly slouchy kind of way. the straight-up ""is she or isn't she"" kind of way."
0,Bought this early in the season - probably washed and worn <8 times and there are small holes that have formed in the front towards the bottom...bummer!
0,Although i am small (size xs on top  27 waist) this dress is not flattering if have any fat on your body....i would not recommend it.
1,I tried these on in the store and was unsure about sizing. once they went on sale i bought the xs and have already worn them twice.good transitional grey colored short into fall. need to be ironed or steamed after wearing for a while but comfy and smooth out easily.
0,Am typically a size 0 and could barely get the extra small on  which is a first. was very cute in theory  but i'd suggest sizing up (maybe 2x).
1,Love this top  i would have bought two but the grey is sold out in my size. very comfortable and true to size.
0,The shirt is nice  but not as nice a material as i was hoping  but i kept it anyway. but after washing it  it is even more disappointing  not very soft and now kind of an odd length. hopefully it will grow on me  but wouldn't recommend it especially for the price.
1,I saw this sweater and just about died. i loved the accentuated shoulders and beautiful knit detail on the sleeves. lucky for me  retailer day started a couple of days after this sweater debuted  and i snagged it right away. i just got it and am in love. it fits true to size and the shoulders and sleeves are everything i hoped they would be. the neckline in very flattering as well. it is soft and the color is gorgeous. if there is a negative  it would be that it is a bit boxy in the torso  and doe
-1,Let me start off by saying that i really  really wanted this jumpsuit to work as it looked good on me and was tts (got a 6p). unfortunately  it didn't work out due to the two buttons at the top which break way too easily. i had to return it and exchange for another jumpsuit but it did me no good as the second one did the very same thing so i didn't even bother trying it on. the buttons broke through before i even got the chance as the material is far too thin and the back of the buttons just pop
-1,"The fabric of this top is lovely. the fit not so. it does not fit as shown on the model. the fit is very large around the middle and fits more like a ""swing"" top. i am 5'9"" slim build. i ordered my usual size medium. shoulders and back fit perfectly. too much material around the middle. had it had a straight cut to it  as shown  i'd keep it. because it doesn't it's going back."
-1,I'm always looking for pieces that would good for either layering or worn alone. this looks cute on the model  but when i received it  it's actually very flowing. i wanted more of a straight cut. doesn't work very well on my body. i'm 5'3  123 lbs.  34-d. it's going back.
-1,I don't normally write reviews  but i purchased this dress in white in 3 different sizes and each dress had the same flaw. the hems were very uneven on all three. this dress was poorly sewn. it's a shame because it looked awesome online. i was very disappointed!!!!!
0,Color not as vibrant as in the picture. skirt is darted  which is not clearly seen in the picture. (assumed would be cut on the bias  which i'm more familiar with in slip dresses.) i didn't fill in the bust and the style is such that it isn't possible to compensate with helpful undergarments. while not for me  i'm still recommending it because it may fit others better. reviewers are instructed to avoid writing about customer service  but i feel compelled to note that the customer service i have
1,I fell in love with this on-line and when it arrived today i think i love it even more because the white portion of this sweater is really a medium pink color which looks so chic. although i am not usually into pink  this looks so stylish with the pink instead of the white. this is a piece you might find in a vintage store in the village in nyc. can't wait for it to get chilly so i can wear it. for reference  i am 5'1  36c chest and the small fit perfect. the quality is really high end as well.
-1,I ordered this in size xl in ivory. it was a drab  poorly-made  too-small sweater. the knit material wasn't good quality and the overall fit didn't work. i liked the light red color and maybe if that had been in stock  then i would have overlooked the problems. but  there are better ivory retailer cardigans available. this was returned.
1,I finally tried this on now that it went on sale  and it was surprisingly flattereing. love the blue color  and i assume the purple was equally nice. fit is true to size as in i tried on the regular xs and it was great  long but ok for me 
0,"This jumpsuit is lovely and comfortable  with gorgeous embroidered detailing  but it really needs to come in petite sizes. at 5'4"" with a pretty proportional torso to leg ratio  i found the hem length okay but the top portion way too long. for the waistband to be anywhere near my natural waist  the shoulders would have had to be taken up several inches and the armholes shortened."
-1,I never leave reviews for anything but this dress was such a complete miss. first off  it's about 3 sizes too big. second off  it's knitted with a metallic thread that you can't really notice in the picture. i'm usually a medium and feel an xs would be sufficient.
-1,I agree with the other reviewer who said there was too much hardware and such. this really does have a lot going on. i usually wear a 4 in skirts  and based on reviews  went up one size. it still saw way up near my chest - i think even an 8 would be too small! it's sooooo tiny at the waist. probably buy 2 sizes  2 and 3 sizes up from your own. also  the skirt flares super wide at the sides  it doesn't sit the way in the photo or maybe the model is holding it down with her hand. it's like a skirt
0,Dress runs very large. quality is great and the pockets are a great addition.
-1,I'm disappointed in these pants  which looked so beautiful online and even have pockets! in person the pattern and colors aren't as nice  the fabric is too thin  and the pants look cheap. the pockets are pretty shallow. the fit isn't good either. i ordered up (i'm between sizes) and they're still not as flowy as i'd have liked. these are too pricy as lounge pants for me to be on the fence about them  so they're going back. if you buy them knowing about the thin fabric and snug fit  they might wo
0,I love this swimsuit - the color  the pattern and the coverage! the material is different for me  but easy to get on and off. my complaint is that  although the backside looks great  there is no padding in the front. for a full coverage suit  this leaves little to the imagination. i'm torn on finding justification to keep it.
0,"This pant is beautiful and fits great except for the waist. it is too big. i carry all my extra weight in my waist too. 5' 6 1/2""  150lbs  straight and up down figure. the waist gapped in the back almost 2 inches. otherwise this is a great pant  if you have a well developed bootie  maybe they would fit. ordered a 10 by the way. if they make it to sale  will purchase again and take to tailor. they are a well constructed lovely pant."
-1,Nice and colorful dress but runs very oversized. material mutes the colors not as vibrant in person.
0,I liked the cut and color. seemed like good quality. i'm 5'5 and theses were so long. i had to fold them up like 6 inches not to step in them
-1,Was really excited for this dress and couldn't be more disappointed. doesn't look anything like the pictures.    the fabric feels...cheap. it came wadded up in a ball and is a wrinkled mess.     looking beyond that  i tried it on and thought i had put it on incorrectly. unfortunately not. the top half doesn't sit correctly. it's so bizarre that it seems like a flaw in the design. it doesn't sit on your shoulders  but doesn't look right off your shoulders. the neckline is very high. also  front b
-1,I am not particularly large but i have thighs! this pair of pants was totally unflattering! my butt looked fine but everything else looked bigger and my legs looked like stumps. i now understand why it's on sale. you may like these pants if you are tall and thin legged. but otherwise skip them. plus the material seems like it would discolor or stain easily. i had a pair from retailer in the same material last year that developed an odd discoloration the first time i wore them.
1,I love the color of this top. it is a dark olive green and elegant. i mostly wear it under a blazer with my jeans. it fits true to size and the smocking detail is casual and elegant at the same time.
1,"I have been wanting this skirt since it came out  and was overjoyed when it went on sale. i got my typical 00 size (24-26 waist  xsmall-xxsmall shirts/dresses)  but when i tried it on i was a bit confused. the waist is a little roomy so there's no way i could wear a 0  but the skirt hugs my butt. and i'm talking in that weird ""hug the butt but flares out awkwardly below way"". now i don't consider myself particularly gifted in the back end department  but this skirt sure says the opposite! i can'"
1,Love it - love the color  fabric and buttons. really comfortable! relaxed fit
1,I thought this dress was lovely on. i'm an 8/10 and tried the med which i believe was the right fit. it may have fit a little large but i liked the way it hung. it has pockets and the color is absolutely beautiful. definitely buying if it makes it to sale.
-1,Very disappointed: runs small in chest and too long. the fabric is cheap but the print is pretty with the bead and flower detail. i don't think  this dress is worth the price  it is not even silk and the underlay feels like cheap gauze. i have been in the fashion industry for over 30 years and this is a miss mark in my opinion. put it back on the rack  and save your $ for something better at sweet retailer!
0,I bought the white tee. while the print is nice  the size is a bit too large with the xs looking relatively baggy (i am around medium weight and very short).
-1,Usually wear s and xs  tried this in s at store but the sides were still lumpy after zipping the size zipper up. if i tried xs it would have looked better but may be bit too tight. the sides of the arm holes were also cut very low. it also has a dusty grey sheen to it that makes it look like old velvet in a bad way. two layers  green on outside  and a polyester beige layer underneath.  but definitely a showpiece that can be paired with a short jacket.
0,Really wanted to love this top...it is beautiful with very good quality but...ran small and tight...also the bottom sides flare out as if it was stitched with too much material looking awkward...
1,This is a heartbreaker! love this dress's colors  length  flow  beading  and style but its extremely tight in the shoulders and bust. hate to see it go back....
0,I've never owned sweater leggings before so these were my first. i had to order large because well i have some junk in the trunk (am 10/12 on bottom and 8 on top). these are a teeny bit scratchy but i'm hoping with a wash they'll soften up--but they're really loose too so i'm also hoping they'll shrink a teensy bit.
1,This jacket is so well made and absolutely beautiful. i usually wear a size 4 or small in everything at retailer. sadly i ordered a small and will have to return it  too tight on chest and arms. i recommend going a size up. also this jacket is really cropped  probably needs a hifh waist pant to compliment it  otherwise might appear too short.
-1,"I bought this in the white  size m (140lbs.  5'8""  34b) because i wanted a baggy fit  which i got  so this is tts. the white is more of an off-white rather than a bright white  which i like because i happen to be looking for an off-white tee. and the shape is good--even in a larger size  this tee nips in at the waist.however  the quality of this tee is lacking  as it is the typical  cheap  marled  slightly see-through material that seems to be everywhere these days and the band on the back of th"
1,"This is my first ever jumpsuit purchase  and i love it! the retailer by me luckily had an xs in stock for me to try  and it fit perfectly (i'm 5'7""  120lbs  slim). looking at the pictures i was a little concerned the jumpsuit would be short  but the length actually hits me closer to my ankles (still a couple inches above). the jumpsuit feels nice and light and comfortable and not difficult to get in and out of. the embroidery detail on the shoulders is a nice touch and the print is fun. would defi"
-1,The colors are vivid and perfectly autumnal but the fit is a mess. it was overall too large  the waistline curves up in the front and then falls into small pleats which was maternityish  the waistband was thicker than the dress and sat away from my body and the material was a cheapish poly. had the outer dress been made from the same material as the lining  i would have liked it better. the modesty closure was a plus but the dress was already unraveling when i took it out. #returned
0,This is a nice choice for holiday gatherings. i like that the length grazes the knee so it is conservative enough for office related gatherings. the size small fit me well - i am usually a size 2/4 with a small bust. in my opinion it runs small and those with larger busts will definitely have to size up (but then perhaps the waist will be too big). the problem with this dress is the quality. the fabrics are terrible. the delicate netting type fabric on the top layer of skirt got stuck in the zip
0,I ordered this in a small petite. with tracy reese i never really know what to expect in terms of sizing. i'm 5 ft tall about 118 pounds. i'm in between a 4 petite and a 6 petite depending on the brand  broad shouldered  slim hipped and very short waisted. i found this dress to fit a little large. it was quite shapeless on me though i did like the wide scoop neck.  i'm sending this back sadly. quality is nice  though a bit thin for winter time.
1,I am so amazed that i finally found the perfect  straight legged denim! not too skinny nor too tight b/c i have athletic calves. i have been waiting a long time! for reference i took a size 26 and usually wear a 2. it is great and comfortable for someone my age! i love these and they are the best investment.
1,"I like this dress because it has a 60's vibe. however  if this swing style is too long  it just looks dowdy. this dress was too long  so i shortened and redeemed mine. i am 5'3 1/2"" and 120 lbs. this style looks best on me just above the kneecap. if you try it on and hate it  it's probably because it's too long. in the winter i wear this with a long sweater (knee length) with a waistband in it to give it shape and with boots. the dress is lined but it is very  very sheer and requires a slip. or "
1,I am normally a size 4/6p in all things retailer but read the reviews and opted to go petite on the maxi and size up. i went with the 8p and even with a 32d bust  had no trouble zipping and it fit beautifully. the band is a tad loose  but any tighter wouldn't have fit in the bust. this dress hangs beautifully and is incredibly flattering  especially for those of us with an athletic build.
0,Bought this on a whim. i had been wanting a new maxi dress and the bodice looked really cool online. ordered it in black. it fits true to size however the material is a bit on the thin side and where the fabric crosses over on the lower waist line...it leaves a love handle lump. without the bulk it would be great as overall look is kind of cool. however  i am on the fence on this one. for the money there are better maxis out there.
0,"Beautiful blouse in theory  however  on my 5'9"" frame it came off like a costume. i truly had a nice chuckle as i looked at myself in the mirror. had to sadly return it"
0,I had tried this on in the beige & loved it but could not find it in my size so i got it in the pink.  did not look at good as the beige.
1,Fit is oversized but intentional. flattering on. love the neckline. modesty might call for a tank top underneath if bending over. fabric is soft  stretchy and has a good quality heft to it.
-1,"The skirt is comfortable and as pictured. it also ran tts. i'm 5'5"" tall and weigh 140 lbs. i had the medium and didn't need to size up to a large. when you put the skirt on a normal body  it looks like you are wearing an easter egg... and not in a good way."
-1,Bought this shirt on-line. wanted to love it but just couldn't. i ordered the xs and it was huge and way too unstructured for my style....just didn't have enough shape. had to send it back.
-1,I ordered these leggings and loved them  for about an hour- at which point the belt loop ripped off of the pant  leaving a hole. i called customer service and they sent me a 2nd pair. same thing happened. i never even pulled on the belt loop. they are just so flimsy. it's a shame bc they are cool looking.
1,"Not what i was expecting  but pleasantly surprised.  was envisioning a more structured/tailored trouser  but these are closer to leggings  albeit very substantial ones with ""real pant"" touches like a zip/button front and (faux) pockets.  they're form fitting  soft yet supportive  stretchy  incredibly comfortable  and tts.  i'm a pretty legit 10 in pants (30/31)  and the 10's near perfect  with the rise coming right to my belly button.  think i'll grab another pair now while they're available."
-1,I loved the look of this sweater  but the workmanship was surprisingly poor. there were missed stitches  and loose threads throughout  and even a tag sewn to the outside. retailer was great about the return. i really wanted to keep it and was very disappointed.
0,I liked this top  i really did. i also liked the subtle shimmer. the fabric didn't seem as soft  but i could not get over the big difference in length between the front and the back. you can see it on the model here  but when i tried it on it was even more obvious and just didn't look right. asymmetrical tops look better when the length difference is not so large  but here it is. the print at the top also made my shoulders look a little broader. i am sending it back.
0,I agree with the other two reviews. it is so disappointing that this adorable dress isn't lined. the fabric is paper thin! this is an a-line style dress with pockets that need to be ironed down to prevent it making you look hippy. i sized down to a petite xs. i normally buy the petite smalls but they were out of it. i would say that this dress runs a little on the large size.
0,Super cute pants but pleats fan out too much when you are pear shaped. i would also need to shorten pants too look like the picture.
-1,"Wanted to love this dress - pretty fabric and colors. i think it would be more flattering on a taller woman (i'm 5'3""  ordered a s)  this just looked like a nightgown on me. sorry to say it's going back."
-1,Just a ginormous  shapeless shirt. runs extremely large. i am normally a medium to large in shirts and the medium was huge. i can only imagine an xs would work and i am no xtra small!
1,Wonderful dress! thank you for making a fun and sassy dress that actually fits me! normally this sort of dress wouldn't fit  with it failing me in the bust  but it fit quite well. in most cases  i would end-up in a 12 petite to accommodate my bust  but with it then too large in the shoulders  or  the dress would have run so small  i wouldn't have been able to button it in most places. i was pleasantly surprised not only with the fit  but the quality  as well.  as described by other reviewers  it
1,"Snapped this sweet puppy up at my local retailer-in the sale room!!!!! it is beyond fabulous and the coral color is divine!!!! brightens up the drearriest of days-i did size down. i am short and the small sleeves were way too long on my 5ft3in frame. it runs a bit large but if you were to wear a heavier something under it i could see getting your ""normal"" size. the quality is great and the style is just lovely. great jacket-love love love"
1,I purchased this dress to wear to a horse race but will also be wearing it all summer long! the material is light weight and has a vintage flare to the print. the button in the center of the dress add an extra detail that keeps the dress pretty and casual.
0,What a huge dissippointment when this arrived home.....  the sleeves are very long and very boxy... i have no idea the condition of this on store  but came with damages on sleeves also  we can tell that was something wrong and i was surprise that retailer sent me something like that  i'm a customer here for a very long time!!!!  dissipointed!!!! ;(
1,Love this skirt. very comfy. looks like it's very expensive material but feels comfortable.
-1,This dress is really nice and lightweight. the slip is snug so the outer part floats nicely. but..it adds a bit too much volume if you have a lot of curves. it disguises in a way but also is a bit less flattering. i really wanted to like it because it's so breezy but a tad matronly on me.
-1,"I love this outfit so much and bought the skirt pictured with the top on the model in high hopes my quest for the perfect date night outfit would be ended. not so. for starters the top is much more of a beige in person. a horrible unflattering color that few can get away with successfully. secondly there is just so. much. fabric. it billows and bunches all over the place to wear it out like that as shown would be silly and to tuck it in looks like i've tried to hard to make it ""work""  lastly the"
0,I ordered this online and i love the style  but didn't like the print as much as i thought i would.

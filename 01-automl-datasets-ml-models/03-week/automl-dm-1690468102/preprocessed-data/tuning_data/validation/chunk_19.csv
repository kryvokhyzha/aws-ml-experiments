0,This was very tight in the bust in my typical size. it fit more or less everywhere else  but the material has no give. so unless you are the precise measurements of the dress  this will be a hard dress to wear.  the color is really lovely though!
1,This dress is amazing! the photos do not do it justice! runs a tad large - definitely can size down.
-1,"I agree with the first reviewer exactly. beautiful fabric and ""idea"" of dress (looks stunning on model)  but huge and shapeless in person like a tent. not at all what i expected when ordering a 2 petite. sadly  has to be returned."
-1,I wanted to love this as i love bright colored patterns. however  when i received the pattern was different than the one pictured and didn't appear as bright and the material was much different than i expected. could almost see through the shirt where it is white and is very thin.  also  i have a larger chest and a smaller waistline and the cut of the where the peplum began made me look larger than i actually am. i am a 36ddd and i normally where a size medium. a medium fit but like i said made
-1,This is a gorgeous print  but i found it too fussy for my taste.  it is quite shapeless so i tried doing a half tuck. it looked cute for about 2 seconds  but then i had to worry about keeping the shoulders down.
1,Comfortable  flattering  one step up in formality from jammies  what more could you want?
0,The smallest size  xs  was big on me  i was overwhelmed by the sweater. it is a bit of swing shape  doesn't hug the body. sleeves are interesting though  but not flattering on a petite frame. color is a pretty green  made me think of wintergreens. fabric may be itchy to some. just ok for me.    for reference xs bog on 115 lbs  30dd  26.5 in waist.
1,This skirt fits true to size and sits on the natural waist nicely. i've paired it with black  and the contrast is very nice. the material is thick enough for winter  but will also work for the fall months  too.
1,My daughter loved this tee the first time she tried it on. since then i have purchased the white  yellow/lemon and rose pink colors for her. the material is soft  it washes well and it looks great. she says these tees are some of the most comfortable she owns and it looks good with shorts  jeans and leggings.
0,I didn't want to get the black carissima because i already own the mona  so when i saw this gorgeous marguerite for sale  i had to bite. the main colors are chocolate brown  copper and rose pink--such a beautiful combination. the hook
-1,This top is on the boxy side but the design is cute and i love the pink color. the problem i had with this shirt is the huge arm holes. one side you could see the top of my bra  the other side was below the side of my bra. you could also see the inside back of the shirt through this arm hole  it was that big. this went back  will not re-order. i usually order xs or xsp  this was an xsp.
0,"I really wanted to love this. sadly  the first thing i noticed was how tight it was in the arms and across the back (size up maybe even two sizes). secondly  it's see through! a top like this looses it's finesse to me once i can see my pant line and bra. it's very difficult to do the three buttons in the back yourself and finally  good luck taking it off without getting make up all over the neckline. someone dubbed it the ""poor man's pineapple top."" i couldn't agree more  sigh. i really did want"
0,This dress looked amazing in the picture. i am 5'10 and since the model was 5'9 with the dress dragging on the ground  i assumed it would be long on me as well. even with flats  this dress is an awkward length. the description says it is 62 in length but i measured it and the dress i got was 52. i will say that it's a beautiful fabric and the quality of the dress is great. it just doesn't look like the dress in the picture at all in terms of the way it hangs and the length.
0,This blouse is very pretty  but it does gap at the top button. darn! such a hassle to have to return it  or exchange it. but i love it and otherwise it seems to fit.
-1,Fell in love with this dress when i saw it online and ordered it right away. however i was sadly disappointed once it arrived. while the cut is cute  the fabric is just all wrong. i was expecting a nice  heavy knit-like material  but this feels and looks really cheap - especially given the price of the dress. sadly it is going back.
-1,I bought the black and gray fleece lined leggings. i thought the price was great. too good to be true. you get what you pay for. once i opened the box they smelled awful. it was a chemical smell. i washed the black pair twice and it was a little better. i have washed the gray 5 times and it still smells.
-1,Thought this would be a great dress for warm days  but alas it fit like a sack. love floreat and have a few of their well made dresses. shame this did nothing for my curves. ordered an 8  usually wear a 10 and it was a tad narrow in the shoulders. if you can sport a loose swingy shape  this is a great dress with nice detailing  but sadly the shape did not work for me.
0,"How can some reviewers say this jacket is true to size  yet others say it runs small? i think it's because this jacket is cropped. by the time i took advantage of the fall perks 20 percent discount  the xs peach was sold out so i ended up ordering size s. i also got the xs gray to compare. sure enough  the xs looks better but is cropped on me. for ref  i'm 5' 5""  32a  115 lbs. i don't really need another almost black jacket so i'm either sized out or have to exchange for xs peach to wear with dr"
1,Love this shirt! i have it in both colors. you can wear it off the shoulder or on. it's baggy enough it looks great with skinny jeans  i recently had a double mastectomy and wore this shirt a lot as it is baggy enough  you couldn't see i had drains underneath my tank top. i am really grateful for this shirt! super soft  super cute!
0,This would be great on someone with a slim build. it's very true to size  it hits above the hips and runs pretty straight through the body for a boxy look. i loved the color and pointelle detail but on my thicker build it just sort of hung in a too-casual way. note that it is the kind of cotton that is likely to stretch with wear (and spring back with cleaning).
1,"I just received this shirt in the mail  and i'm in love. it isn't your average t-shirt in that it has character and class. i can't wait to wear it! another reviewer was unhappy that the embroidery in blue on the back wasn't as dramatic as the picture; i'm not seeing it. i think the blue stands out very well. i know i should say  ""hurry and get yours before they're gone "" but in truth  i'd rather be the only one with this beautiful shirt! :)"
1,I adore this blouse. the colors are vibrant (see my photo below). this is one of my favorite purchases from retailer. the top is light weight. true to size. i ordered a petite small and am 5 feet tall 120 lbs. and curvy. i left it untucked and loose like in the photo and it was very flattering. i disagree about it being frumpy. i wore it with kelly green retailer brand slacks paired with the retailer yellow sweater coat with white piping  and the retailer moss suede cross bag and neutral color (nude) fl
-1,"I'm so disappointed this dress didn't work out! i ordered the size medium  post baby i'm a solid dress size 6 or 8 depending on the designer.  the cashier was laughing with me how ridiculously huge this garment was when i held it up.     also the length was super long  description says 35"" which would be mid thigh for me  but this thing hit me mid knee. also  like the previous review the shoulders are tented and poofy. so bizarre and the cut reminds me of a maternity dress  but the shoulders def"
-1,I purchased this item in the gray heather color and loved it so much i wanted to buy every other color. the fabric was cottony and felt very soft and cushy against my skin  and the gray color was from the combination of black and white fibers. i ordered the light gray and the red online and could not wait for them to arrive. but the other colors were not even in the same material  but a very shiny and synthetic feeling fabric  with just a single color weave that did not have the same feel or tex
0,Dress cut was great  but the collar was so oblong that it looked space-age.
0,If you have any curves at all then this will look like a sack on you. i wanted to love it because of the material and i've been looking for a blazer/ jacket that was heavy in weight. this just looked awful on me. maybe for someone who is very slender this will work but i was highly disappointed in the cut.
1,Falls beautifully and the color is vibrant. can be dressed up or worn casually. texture adds even more uniqueness. a little heavy but this is outweighed by its other lovely features.
0,I just sent this back. it is very cute & the fabric is great  so soft & comfy  but it doesn't work with my shape. it is extremely swingy in shape and the buttons up the front only work if you don't have a large chest. on me  it looks like maternity and it gaps when i button it. am a 34dd. it's not the fault of the top  but a bigger size would have swallowed me. i think if you are thin and also not top-heavy like the model  this will be adorable on you. i am just too busty.
-1,I'm petite  but even if i weren't  i think this runs very large  isn't form flattering at all  and overall looks dull. it most definitely does not justify the price. material is thin.
1,I purchased this top online  love the off the shoulder trend and this looked like it would be perfect for fall. nice fabric and lace detail but the top definitely runs big! i ordered an xl and it was beyond swimming on me. definitely order a size or two down! also  it is very long / tunic length. i love a tunic but it almost wore more as a dress than a top! overall  cute item and fabric but definitely order down!!
0,I received the vest and it was pretty much as pictured however  the color isn't quite yellow; it has a little green to it  kind of chartreuse.    i returned the item because it didn't look as good on me as it did on the pictured model. this would probably look better on someone taller than me.
0,"I loved this top in the blue and wanted so badly for it to fit however it was very unflattering on my 5'7"" frame. the bottom hemline is straight across all around whereas i thought it was longer in the back. i could see this looking great on a really petite frame. runs large  xs fit however wasn't flattering"
1,"Love this top.  i get compliments every time i wear it.  got the medium. fits perfect. 5'4""  138#.  even at my age it looks great."
-1,I ordered these twice just to be sure there wasn't a glitch. the color is so off! the picture shows a dark blue denim  but they are not they are a light blue - with whiskering! retailer you need to have a better image of the color because this is so misleading.
0,This piece is lovely if you do not plan to use your arms  or if you are a t-rex. if you are not a mannequin or a dinosaur and actually plan to use your arms  this top may not be for you.
1,I wasn't expecting to like this tank as much as i do because of the other reviews...i thought i would send it back if i didn't like it  i appreciate the design  fabric  and construction! i plan on wearing it out to dinner with some friends coming in from out of town tomorrow night...can't wait!
0,I wore this coat one day and the buttons started falling off. it stretched so much. i'm going to beg my local store to take back. it shouldn't fall apart like that. it's super duper cozy though.
-1,Bought this cami/tank on sale which i'm glad but it has a flap underneath like a bralette but not fitted..it kinda just drapes under the cami...the problem is it's not thick enough to offer the coverage you would want under a white tank ...but it was also too short so it caused a visible line underneath that showed through.that was higher than the bottom of my chest ..so it gave the appearance that i wore the wrong bra/undergarment...it simply looks awkward ...not sure if it would've been better
1,This dress is very versatile - it will be cool and comfortable in the summer  but one could also wear it with leggings or skinny jeans in the winter with a sweater or jacket. it can be worn casually with a belt  or dressed up with a statement necklace and earrings for a night out. the black color is more like a charcoal grey  which suits me fine. grab it while you can - it's a good deal for the current sale on sale price!
0,I have a love/hate relationship with these jeans. when i first put them on  i felt like i had finally found my favorite pair of jeans. everything about how they fit and looked was just perfect - and they were offered in a petite size! but then two hours later they were sagging. the fabric is so cozy  but it just stretches too much  too fast. i am not willing to give up yet  so i ordered another pair in a smaller size. i'm less than thrilled about having to shell out the $$ for two pairs  but i r
-1,I was really disappointed in the shirt. the blue embroidery is a lot darker than what is shown in the photo  and barely stands out against the black. the photo does not accurately depict this shirt. i will be returning.
0,This sweater runs true to size. i am 5'7' and 125 lbs and ordered the small. it has a beautiful mix of colors that reminds me of a creamsicle. it is a well made  heavy sweater that will definitely keep you warm. if you like the feel of wool  buy it. if not  pass on it.
1,This top is really cute- the plum is a lovely color and the top fits true to size. love the back detailing. and it is really good t-shirt quality.
1,Great transition into fall for layering. easy breezy dress up or down-is thin so it does need a cami
1,I ordered this dress in size xl in the grey/red/yellow combination. i love everything about this dress. it's comfortable. the colors are cheerful. the proportions of where the stripes are placed works. but  i have to return this dress. it's too short for what i'm comfortable wearing. i saw from the photos that this comes mid-thigh on the taller models. i hoped that would mean it would be more knee-length for me. unfortunately  it's just too short and i'd feel self-conscious. i don't want to deal
0,I fell in love with this trench when i first saw it online but ended up returning it once i tried it on. i'm 5'9  140 lbs and the m fit true to size. but the belt hit above my natural waistline and the skirt of the coat was much fuller than i expected  making me look heavier. the material also wrinkles easily and the stitching was poor quality with lots of loose threads. disappointed  as the color and concept were great.
-1,It's a rather boring tank. i thought it'd be perfect under a cardigan for work  but decided against it. the fit is boxy  and does not look good on a girl with curves.
-1,I wanted to like this coat so bad! i loved the bright red color and design  but when i received it  it seemed very cheap and just too large. i returned it.
1,"The is a cute dress with a great pattern and nice material. it would look great on the right kind of figure. i'm 5'7"" and slim  but at thirteen weeks pregnant and not showing  the skirt made me look about thirty weeks pregnant  but the top fit just fine."
1,I typically wear an xs to s in tops and purchased an xs for a less flowy fit.  this top has a luxurious feel and the green color is really beautiful (more matte than shiny).  perfect piece to wear under a jacket or blazer.
0,Beautiful and versatile dress but shoddy quality. i hand washed (per the instructions) it after wearing it once  and the sleeves are already falling apart.
1,Being six feet tall  i'm always combing reviews for the opinions of other tall women  and i'm glad i did on this one! with the off the shoulder look  you can sometimes gain extra length  and it's true in this case. i stayed tts because of length issues  and while it is billowy  it's not horribly so. i would think  however  if you're between sizes  or not worried about height  i'd go with the smaller option. adorable  comfy  casual while being dressy enough for a night out!
0,This dress felt small in torso and waist and suffocating in sleeves ( i do have average athletic arms). but the shoulders were cut so wide that one side was falling off  as i fix  one shoulder  another will slide down. the material is nice but since it is not lined  it feels inexpensive  disposable.
-1,Unlike the other two reviews   i found this dress horrid. i ordered a xs since i am between that and a s. it was just too much fabric for me. . i have a small frame  so it was just so overwhelming  the armholes were big and i felt like i had a bag on me. colors were nice and fabric was soft and light.. the belt made no sense as others have said. length was good. i tried it on as soon as i got it and couldn't take it off fast enough. i literally ran to the post office and back it goes. this is my
1,"This is truly the best black dress...you can wear to sooo many things. a long time keeper for the closet. i felt it ran a little bit big...i am normally an 8-10...i bought both sizes (8 and 10)...kept the 8...but felt i could even get away with a 6...but didn't want to pay shipping again for another size. i am 5'7"" and 155lbs. it is truly a flattering dress for any figure."
0,The white is completely sheer. i am so tired of see through shirts!! even at the sale on top of sale prices  i wouldn't recommend this shirt. if the fabric weren't sheer it would be a very comfy shirt with a cute back. but it just looks silly with a tank top under it  the cotton just doesn't lay right.
0,"Great item. ordered for my wife for christmas. received it and the medium petite waist size measured at approximately 26"" (so it is at least 2"" off the standard--and a thick material needs a bit more room to fit well). disappointed! replaced with next size up...we'll see!"
1,Love this pullover for its versatile style (can be buttoned or unbuttoned) and easy care look. it's casual without looking sloppy. the weave is a bit open work and can easily complement a cami or a thicker top without making me look like a stuffed sausage. the hi-lo hem on the model shots do not look that way irl. the hem is straighter. soft nubbly texture that may snag easily. got this in red and brown but wanted the sold out green too.
-1,I like my dresses oversized but this one is ridiculous. it's seriously unflattering. i usually between a m & a l and i got a small and it's still massive. but the slip is tiny.     it looks so cute in the picture. but not good in person.
-1,"I ordered this online  and when i opened the package  i was impressed with the quality of the material and stitching for this top. it is much nicer than a basic t-shirt.    when i tried this on  the band of stitching that was supposed to go beneath my chest was sitting on top of my cleavage! also  the overall length is listed as 27"" long  but i think that is the back of the shirt. the front of the shirt is very short on me (i'm 5'10"")  hitting well above my hip bones.    if only this was much  m"
-1,The suit is lovely  but it is very long in the torso and gaps at the leg. i was told that it runs small and to size up to a 10. i did  but i do not think the smaller one would have done better. the bust is fake and it turns out when untied. worst of all it emphasizes the tummy. all in all not a good look for me. i am not heavy but i do need tummy support. normally i wear an 8 and in garnet hill a 6. sorry but it went back. i really wanted to like it.
0,I'm a 14 bottom and a 10/12 on top  so i'm curvy  which makes one-piece swimsuits hard to shop for. i ordered a m & l  and while the m overall fit me better  the cup size was still way too big on me. i'm a 34d  and i need another set of my 'girls' to fit into the cups. otherwise this swimsuit is so beautiful!
1,"Bought pink and cream colors on sale. arm holes on my usual size medium were large so bought smalls and like them a lot. i'm 5'9"" and longer front and back worked well. fabric weave nice weight and good for summer or cooler with sweater or jacket over it."
0,This dress was super cute online. i ordered it in small and medium  both fit  one tighter--obviously  but could have gotten away with either. the dress is cut a little funny under the armpits and fell a little weird in front so i didn't think it was flattering on me. it would be flattering on very slim body  smaller on top. i sent it back. i'm a 34 c  athletic build.
1,This sweet dress is perfect for fall and spring because the knit is not too thick  the drape allows layers and the colors are very versatile.  the style is loose if you stay tts but will be a slimmer fit if you size down.  if your body habitus is super slender  definitely size down.  the liner slip is soft and the back side of the knit is a bit scratchy.  i think this dress is beautiful and best of all  forgiving.  i'm happy to have tried both colors--the problem is picking which one to keep!  m
1,I picked this dress up to take into the dressing room to try on without looking at the price tag. im typically a small and he dress in store was an xs but because of the wrap i figured i'd try it anyway. this dress is to die for! the xs fit me just fine (though the snap at the chest wouldn't stay closed but i thought it looked ok). i looked at the tag after falling in love with the dress but left the store without it. i'm contemplating purchasing it still because i can't stop thinking about it!!
-1,The fit was not flattering at all  but the worst part was the colors were really dull and not bright as shown in the online photos.
1,This is my first maxi skirt and i am pleasantly surprised! i might not have purchased this had i not tried it on in store  but did for the fun of it and loved the shape and swing of the skirt. the material is a comfortable and substantial stretchy jersey fabric with an inner lining that keeps it from being sheer. though it is kind of a dark navy  i would agree with one of the previous reviewers that it could pass for a black and white pattern. for my sister's graduation  i paired it with a white
-1,After seeing this on anthto's facebook page i was so excited to order. i ended up going to a store and trying on. i couldn't believe it was the same shirts when i first saw it. i thought this ran quite big. and the shape was odd. lots of material in the middle. i am a mom of 3 young kids and didn't want people to think #4 was on the way.
-1,The print and fabric are great  but this dress has odd construction  or maybe i have an odd construction. anyway  i'm 5-5  weigh 125-130  36d. i ordered the small and it fit perfect up top and in the arms - but the issue was in the hips. i'm somewhere between athletic and curvy. the skirt looks more a-line in the photo  but it's actually cut pretty straight. spanx would have helped  but i'm not about to wear spanx all day in a work/casual dress  i think a medium would make the top too big  so i
-1,"Maybe it's because i'm 40  but this top was underwhelming. i felt like it was a cheap tee with a big  obnoxious bow on the back. it does look cute on the model  so maybe it's a ""younger"" top. i would have felt silly wearing it."
-1,The top is more of a cream color than an ivory. it's also a bit boxer than anticipated. fit is true to size.

-1,Fits like a maternity top. not for my age group or build.
0,I tried this blouse on in the store and chose not to purchase it. i did not think the fabric or design warranted the price point as it felt a bit cheap and there's not much to the design. it is true to size - my usual size 4 fit well enough. i'm on the tall side with an average bust and i did not find it short. my friend was shopping with me and she thought it looked maternity on her as she is thin but very well endowed. she also thought it made her shoulders look broad. personally i liked it on
1,I bought this shirt in black and it goes with everything. definitely runs large-i have big boobs and bought the xl and returned it for the large which was even still a bit too big (long running in the sleeves) though i was comfortable with keeping it. it's a soft  comfortable shirt. the snap detail is quirky and allows multiple looks/ styling. i love the shirt and i'm glad i got in on it while i did.
0,Totally pretty but not crazy flattering. a bit wide in the hip area if you are not tall. good on sale but i wouldn't pay full price.
1,These jeans are well-made  the cut is decently flattering  but on more muscular thighs  it would look nicer if the cuff was a bit higher. the petite on me was just below the ankle  so it just looks like i folded my jeans because they were too long. if you are taller or have longer legs (mine are short on my short height)  then i think these would be great. i dind't find them particularly small  but htey were snug (muscular thighs). overall  ok but returning them. (25 p ordered  115 lbs  26.5 in
-1,Super cute dress but the waist band is very large and bulky.
0,I loved the look of this top the moment i saw it in the store  particularly the muted red color. the crochet detail is very pretty and i found the fit to be quite flattering on me. however  part of the crochet detail on the one i received has a hole that needs to be repaired. since i purchased during the sale  i'm going to try and mend myself  but this may end up having to go back. if you see this in store and find one that is not damaged  i would recommend it!
0,Very attractive pattern and color. the black is so soft that it seems close to sepia. the length was fine. the fabric  meaning the dress  is quite heavy for not having a lining except just around the bra area---even though the facing didn't successfully substitute for a bra in my opinion. the arm holes are cut in quite a bit so one would have to find the appropriate bra.  the dress runs very large. i ordered an xs petite. it was about 2 inches too large (4 inches total) on either side across the
-1,I was surprised at the positive reviews for this product. its terrible! it cuts you in a weird place to make you look wide. the skirt is also not like the picture. its darker and heavier. the material isnt great. i had to return.
1,Great looking  please dry clean it or you'll ruin it  fits well  easy to make an outfit look stylish
0,The arm holes are just weird .. a little too big for me was just 'off'... back it goes.
1,The fold over is so comfy. not the most flattering but really when you are wearing it you are going for comfort i think. bought these on sale and trying to decide if they are worth it or not
1,These jeans! i tried these on  in addition to the high rise paige denim  and these won out hands down. classic flattering fit from mother  with an element of edginess with the frayed hem. these are long enough on me (i'm 5'5') to cuff at the ankle if i don't want a distressed look on a particular day. they are slightly stretchy like other mother denim but not so much that i would size down. i have muscular calves and thighs  but someone who does not could likely size down and be happy with the a
-1,"This dress reminds me of a fabric used for curtains. it is sturdy beautiful and strong. i looked like a large picture window in it. if i was 5'10"" and 120 pounds it may have worked ?"
1,Was looking for the perfect birthday dress....and i found it! gorgeous! i generally wear a size 0 or 2 but opted for a size 4 to give some wiggle room and it still fit me like a glove.
0,I had different expectations for this shirt in blue and when i received the item it didn't met those expectations. the material is very good quality but there is nothing extraordinary about the shirt  it is jus very plain. this item is being returned.
-1,Saw this on the sale rack and decided to try on. i looked like the dancing hypos in the movie fantasia. i am petite and not heavy but this is for very slim and tall people. too much fabric in the peplum part.
0,Kinda a boxy looking sweater. it definitely made me look really large and just couldn't see myself wearing it very often. ended up returning it.
1,I've been wanting a higher-waisted  button-front skirt. this one was perfect because of the texture on the denim.. it makes it dressy enough to wear to work if you are in a business-casual setting. i think it has a ton of versatility for multiple seasons. i'm normally a 0 or 2 in dresses (5'6  118 lbs) and i ordered a 0 in the skirt  as the natural waist is a little on the large side. i love it!
-1,I've been wearing these shorts for years  i work outside and it was great to have comfortable jean shorts that were just the perfect length. the fabric quality on these shorts (and many many other retailer items) has gone down. sure  they're great when you try them on in the store..soft  comfortable  flattering  but when these are worn for a day they get so stretched out that i feel like i need a belt to keep them on. i wore these several times  sat down on a relatively smooth concrete wall  and a
0,These pajama pants are beautiful but very sheer and very delicate.  not ideal for a mom with kids
1,Beautiful skirt but does run small. i wear a small and am able to keep the skirt but have to be very careful about under garments since it is so tight. looks great though.
-1,As another reviewer wrote.. this is not the same jean featured on the website. same cut and style but it's a light denim wash with wiskering and worn look at the knees. i called customer service to see if this was a mistake and they said there was not really a way to check it unless i exchanged them. i didnt want the same wrong jeans again so i opted out ... too bad they are cure.
-1,I have always bought interesting  pretty  wearable dresses for my daughters at retailer. now the dresses are just retro funky. sad to see.
0,On the mannequin this looked adorable. it is made well but if you have any bustline it just billows out below like a tent and is not flattering. if it had less fullness it would have been really cute.
0,I remember seeing this great jackets online and knowing that i would have to have it! so i traveled to the store to try it on. the ruffle on the bottom was beautiful and fluffy and just like the pictures. the color was perfect and it was lightweight enough i could get more uses out of it that most of my coats in the texas heat. so i tried on the small. the didn't quite button over my bust  and i did an arm wiggle that made the arms too tight near where they met my body. no problem  medium it is.
0,"I'm usually a 6 in dresses and the 6 here fit okay. loose but still flattering a little long for a sundress. i was unhappy with it looking a little frumpy and being so loose under the arms all my bras showed . i took it back to the store and after reading the reviews here decided to try the smaller sizes...well multiple dresses later i ended up buying a size 2 petite!!! and i'm 5'9"". the 2 reg and petite still had the loose gathering look to the top but both fit much better under the arms so tha"
-1,This blouse is beautiful and i saw someone wearing it and she looked great. i went and bought this to wear for a holiday party and it is not for people with any sort of chest! it looked ridiculous on me as the pleats started right at the bra line and caused the blouse to tent out in both directions! however - looks super cute on those more on the flat-chested side!
0,This is a beautiful top  however it looks better on the 80 pound model. the shirt sits awkward on your chest if you have any cleavage and there is way too much fabric around the body. if you are any size beyond a 2 then it just makes you look bigger than you are.
-1,The fabric wrinkles so easily and any slight moisture or liquid immediately turns into a dark spot on the blue grey...condensation drips from a glass  gel deodorant  etc. i tried the cream but it's very sheer. i had to return this dress-- not practical!
-1,I was extremely excited to receive these pants  given the two positive reviews. i'm a petite woman and have trouble finding jeans with the right proportions. i sized down from my normal size (27 to a 26) and was swimming in these pants. i would have had to go down three sizes to make these work. i'm not sure if i received a defective pair or what  but be cautious ordering these pants.
0,I think you have to have stick legs/legs for days for this style to fit as pictured. i thought i had found the perfect boyfriend jean  but once these babies arrived i was really disappointed. the color is slightly brighter than the picture  which is fine  though i was digging the slightly greyed look.    anyway  these were loose in the waist and crotch and fit snugly everywhere else. i have a fairly athletic build  so it's not uncommon for me to have issues with fit around the calves and thighs 
0,I nearly always wear a size small  and sometimes even a small is too large. not in this case; this top is extremely snug. i would not be able to wear this  and i would've returned for a larger size but the ivory color was a little too yellow for me. in the online photo. the color is more of an off-white than ivory yellow. i'm guessing also that this fabric may not stand the test of time and easily snag. but that's just conjecture.
0,I saw this jacket in the store and thought it was really cute..and finally a nice length!! ordered the xl because l and was afraid of shrinkage and it is no larger than the l. runs at least a size small with not alot of give. i will unfortunately have to bring it back.
0,These jeans look slouchy and shorter in the pic which was exactly what i was looking for  but they fit more like regular boot cuts on me and proved to be much longer than expected. i have fairly long legs and most jeans hit me like they do on the models  but these were very long. i only buy citizens of humanity and paige jeans and i can almost always buy online for them when it comes to skinny jeans  but these did not fit the same as their other styles. they are good quality and would probably f
1,Great lightweight summer top that's bra friendly.  i bought the teal color yesterday and wore it today with white skinnies.    i'm sometimes a small and sometimes a medium and was fine with the small on this one
-1,Very unflattering and no shape or flair. lots of extra material but no swing or shape. do not recommend.
-1,These are my all time comfiest shorts and i am obsessed with the lavender color. sadly  using free and clear detergent on a cold  delicate cycle made the color turn splotchy  and they are unwearable. this happened once and i exchanged for another pair  but i'll be returning this pair. i'll be sad to see my favorite color go  but there is obviously a defect in the dye used. maybe i'll try another color!
-1,This sweater is the perfect sweater except for one thing.....it sheds everywhere. i can simply pick up the sweater and shake it in one hand and 40 large pieces of lint go everywhere on the ground and on you. if you like dark jeans- don't purchase. before i walked out of the store- the salesperson had to use a delineator on me- it was hysterical. sheds so much
-1,I took advantage of the summer tag sale and bought a few tops including this one. i've been eyeing this online for quite some time  so i was pretty excited to get it at such a good price. it came in the mail the other day. it's like christmas morning when you see an retailer package at your door  however  this time wasn't so great. the top is fine. average at best. the top fits true to size. maybe it's the pattern or the cut  but it didn't work well on my body. i recommend trying this on first.
1,Great fit  very soft fabric  and the sleeves are long enough!! great length in the body too.
0,The styling of this top is really cute. it fits perfectly on the shoulders and gets bigger at the hem for the baby doll look. my biggest complaint is the quality! it's really cheap and feels like the quality i would expect to see at a cheap retailer. it catches lint like crazy and because the hem is just a pearl edge  it curls really badly. i buy quite a bit from here and this is the worst quality item i have seen in a long time. not worth the $$ if paying full price.
0,"I would give it a 3.5 if half star possible. like other reviews said  the material is a little cheap and back zip got stuck when i tried to unzip it before trying it on. overall  nice color and flattering look that could be dress up or down. i am 5'8""  155lbs  36b and m is a little snug for me on the top."
1,I felt a review would be helpful for anyone between sizes. i am long  lean  and broad shouldered. i normally wear a m  but ordered a l. it still fits snug  so i've exchanged for an xl in order to get the drape  as pictured on the model. material and color of the red motif is darling; light as a feather & will take me spring through summer.
0,"I ordered 2 sizes to try for in store pickup. both were too large  so size down (i am 5'4""  125 lbs and the s was too large in the neck and body  even though i generally wear things large). also  the collar was a hemmed flat collar  not the roll collar depicted. i reviewed that with the salesperson as well -- we were both at a loss to explain why  and the tiger embellishments were more orange  yellow and glittery on the ones i ordered."
-1,I waited a long time to get this top. unfortunately i will be returning. the sides are gathered and stick out a lot on the sides. not as pictured. the sides should have been pleated. it runs smaller in the bust and when closed it was a little snug. afraid this might shrink with dry cleaning or washing. the design is unique and wish this top would of worked.
1,"Contrary to what previous reviewers have said  i think this top fits really well  and is very flattering. i also don't find it too long at all. i normally wear a size small  and got this in a size 4. no gapping at the chest  and i'm a 34d. (5'4""  124 lbs  36-27-35). and the colors in the striped version are really pretty. i plan to wear it now and right through spring. i did have a quality issue  however. the first one i received had bunched up stitching where the pleats begin right below the po"
1,"I saw this online but it never struck me as something i would wear. however  after seeing it in the store it really caught my eye with its detailing  so i tried it on. what a great decision because it is so much more beautiful in person  and very soft and warm. it's a perfect winter sweater to start the new year. i am 5'-7""  138 lbs. and the medium fit perfectly  though it's a little shorter on me than shown in the photos."
0,The sweater is very very warm. it looks okay  not the best but not bad. i had high expectations so was disappointed to see no closure  i don't wear sweaters and jackets without closures. i like having the option of closing buttons if it gets any colder. so i am sending it back.
0,Not what i expected. they ran very small and the fabric seemed cheap for the price. returned.
1,This is such a unique design and i love the colors. i could be a small or x-small and chose the x-small  fits perfectly.
1,Following another reviewer's advice  i ordered up to an xl. it's huge. stick with your normal size or go down one. it's a one of a kind piece. soft  lightweight  yet cozy and adorable. sadly have to return mine.
1,I love this blouse with a pair of jeans. the neckline is fairly deep but very flattering and feminine. the detail is beautiful.
1,I purchased this adorable dress to wear on vacation. it's such a cute fun print. i purchased my regular size xs and it's a good fit. the material is a little stiff but the print makes up for it. got it during the 25 percent promo ..
1,Love this blouse. i usually wear a small and had to exchange it for an xs  which fits perfectly. not form fitting but flattering; washes beautifully  too. i highly recommend this blouse.
1,I'm 5'4  112 pounds. xs petite was a good fit with room for a heavier top. fabric is somewhat picky  so long sleeve is necessary. overall  coat is beautiful and worth the money. nice  unique fall piece.
-1,I'm a big retailer buyer- and usually love the dresses  especially the petite xs maxis. this was the worst retailer purchase i have ever made.     it was humongous and gave me no shape. even if i purchased an xxsp it probably would be the same. i'm small but i mean come on- this would only fit a giantess-- which also makes no sense because it's the petite size.     do not buy. i'm very upset i have to pay the $5.95 return fee since i ordered this.
1,"Love this dress so much! i bought the cranberry color first  and i loved it so much  that i also bought it in black. i think it runs fairly true to size. i am 5'3"" and about 110  and the xs petite fit perfectly. i tried the xs  and it was pretty large on my frame. i love the fabric and flow of this dress  and i love the pockets."
1,I ordered an extra small. it fits with both a humble tee and a button down with the sleeves rolled up. i've tried it with jeans and also joggers and heels. really a cute and versatile sweater. i got the olive but can see where the black might be more universally useful. this one works perfectly for me  however
1,This lovely number met all my expectations. ordered an xl  and glad i did. the fabric and styling has flattering drape and it can be dressed up or worn for a casual night out. if it was available in another classic color  or a subtle neutral pattern i'd probably purchase a second one (hint hint retailer).
-1,This dress is just very unattractive. it is quite short-waisted  almost empire and so the pockets hit in an odd place. also it is very long - midi length - and the skirt is very wide. the effect is matronly  not cute at all. size-wise it fit true to size and it is a nice medium weight denim and the construction is good.
-1,"Was excited to receive this dress  as it had some great reviews. however  of the love was coming from the 5'5""+ set. as a petite  this didn't work well for me  and the fabric flattened me out in the bust in an awkward way. returned."
0,I couldn't get this to work for me. tried a variety of sizes and just couldn't get it to flow right. didn't purchase.
-1,I really liked the casual style of this top  but i was disappointed when i put it on.  it's cut weird- the shoulder cut-outs are smaller than pictured and just don't seem to hang right.  they don't hit where they're supposed to and the sleeves were also not as pictured  more like 3/4 which i didn't like.  the color is really nice and i liked the fabric but the fit was just off.  i tried xs and s.  both fit weird.
-1,I really loved this top. however  i couldn't get it on. i tried on a medium (my usual size.) it's not that it was too small. something else is wrong with it. the large was way too big. too bad  i really wanted this look.
1,These are my favourite sleep pants. the waist band shrinks with every wash even without drying all the way on low. i normally wear a small and ended up getting the large so the waist band didn't cut in my sides.
0,Due to the black sheath being out of stock in all sizes (for quite some time)  i took my chances ordering an 8p in navy which was way too big on me. i also didnt love the navy. i wish i could try the 6 or 6p in black but out of stock and wouldn't arrive in time for my events. sadly returning.
-1,This top is gorgeous and i exchanged it 3 times hoping it would work. i originally got the size a would normally wear (a 6).and the arm holes and top were extremely tight and the top was short so i sized up and still had the same problem. i then went all the way up to a size 14 in order to get the length of the shirt log enough but now it is quite large around my hips. i love the detailing of the shirt but unfortunately if you have any chest at all it will not fit
-1,"I wanted this skirt to work! it is soft  comfortable  and cute! unfortunately  it runs to short.  i am 5'8"" and would not be able to pull it off at work. i ordered a bigger size and it still didn't work."
-1,I have been waiting for this sweater coat to ship for weeks and i was so excited for it to arrive. this coat is not true to size and made me look short and squat. the sleeves are very wide (although long). as a light weight fall coat the sleeves don't need to be as wide because you wouldn't be layerng too much underneath. the buttons need to be moved at least three inches in for a nicer fit. i thought about redoing the buttons myself but the sleeves looked even more out of proportion with a tigh
0,"The dress immediately caught my eye in the store. upon trying it on  i discovered that the slip runs extremely small (and unnecessarily so considering the looseness of the shift). the skirt is a tad long--i'm 5'6"" and it hits mid-knee. it's a shame the slip was so tight--i loved the dress otherwise."

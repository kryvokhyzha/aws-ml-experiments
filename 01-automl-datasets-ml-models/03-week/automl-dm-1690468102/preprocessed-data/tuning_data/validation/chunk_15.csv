1,I'm so sad this doesn't come in a petite length because the dress is extremely long! the fabric and design is beautiful although i do wish the fabric was a bit more flowly.
0,Let me start by saying that i cannot wear wool. it doesn't matter what type it is or if it is combined with cashmere  it makes me itch so much that i just can't do it and i didn't not find this as itchy as others stated. that being said  you definitely need to size down. i am a standard small and purchased the xs and there is still a load of fabric. i still don't know what to think. i think it is okay but i am not sure it justifies the price point.
1,"Many internet reviews note that byron lars dresses run large and suggest that women 5'5"" and under should size down and go petite. i am 5'3"" and 101 pounds and the 0 petite size was too snug across my back and too short when i sat down. when i stood up i had to pull the dress down  as it would bunch up around the hips. therefore  the size 2 regular ended up being a perfect fit  no alterations needed. i was searching for a dress for an upcoming wedding and for vacation and kept coming back to thi"
-1,"The photos don't look it  but the one i received was a cropped length. the bottom of the sweater's longest parts didn't even reach the top of my mid-rise pants. and i'm 5'3"" so it wasn't that the model is a lot shorter than me unless their models are 4' tall.     disappointed since i wasted my retailer discount on this!"
0,I adore this blouse  but the cut is a bit weird. the shoulders fit snugly and the body is blousy/boxy. the colors are super cute and the cutouts are unique but i don't think this top is for everyone.
1,"I really like the appearance of this item  and it looks pleasing with many different styles of leggings. it does run a little large. i am a ""true to size"" small  and this hangs on me a little  but i love the design of the back. it is so soft and comfortable!"
0,"I agree with the review above regarding the sizing of the dress being large. i am a pear shape so i was worried the small would be tight in the hips however  the dress as a whole seemed large and not overly shapely. i'm 5'8"" but i also thought the dress was an inch or so shorter than i would prefer for a winter/fall dress. the dress is a very dark forest green (not black). see the photo for the shaping of the dress - it shoes that  due to the material  it oddly bulges in certain regions rather t"
0,Beautiful dress but the fit was off for me. overall this is good quality with beautiful lace detail. as the other reviewer mentioned the cutout in the back is very cute. i wanted to love this dress but i found it to run large in the top. i'm 5'6 130lb with 34c and i ordered the small  the top just hung off of me. perhaps it would have been better with an xs.
-1,This sweater was not as featured in the picture. the front is completely cropped while the back is regular length. the front barely reached the middle of my stomach. also  the color was not as vibrant as shown in the picture. this sweater will be going back.
1,Loved this dress and was even happier to learn i could order it in petite!!
-1,"My 3 daughters and i all wear a size small and are heights range between 5'2 and 5'10 . this dress was sloppy on every one of us. i don't think a size x small would have made a difference. the length is all over the place .i""m not sure how or where you would fit a bra into the picture. on the positive side was very soft. it may work as a beach cover -up."
1,This dress fits well and the material allows for hiding lumps and bumps. material is heavy  yet soft. i could see wearing it with sneakers as the model is  or dressing it up with jewelry and heels. this will be a perfect dress to take on vacation  as it won't get wrinkled and it is so versatile. i'm normally a size 4-8 depending on clothing item  and i bought this in a size small. fits perfect. for reference  i am 38-26-38.
-1,This is more of an undershirt than a shirt. the material is very very thin and it shows everything. it was beyond unflattering on me. don't buy this unless you have a knockout thin body.
-1,I was so excited to get these. i paid for two day shipping and ordered medium and large . sadly they did not fit. i usually wear medium but ordered both just in case. i'm very disappointed that they run so small and are not true to size. they are super cute from someone skinny.
0,This is a pretty dress. i bought a size 0 and the body of the dress fit  however  the sleeves were too long. had to return  as the loose and longer sleeves made the dress look too big on me.
-1,"I'm 5'3"" about 130lbs and ordered a size 6. the print on the fabric is as expected but the shape of the dress and fit were not good at all. i probably would wear a 4 instead of the 6  but could tell that even if i had the 4  the cut of it still wouldn't be flattering on me at all. it was baggy in odd places and had no shape. the outer fabric is very sheer and see through and the lining is nice  with a fitted slip design."
-1,"This could seriously fit a large and it's an xs. so frustrating!! this is the fourth retailer dress that is ordered that is just enormous. i get the whole ""loose fit"" style  but seriously??? you've taken it to a whole new level  retailer!!! another trip to the store to return another item. a complete waste of my time. ugh."
-1,This dress really was huge  and not at all flattering. i don't know how they got it to look good on the model in the picture. material was nice and soft  but i really don't see how anyone could look good in this  no matter what your body shape is.
1,"I *love* this tunic. i'm 5'5"" and can wear it as a dress with bike shorts or leggings. it is so soft and comfortable  and i love the pink color--very versatile. my favorite thing about this piece--i am a 36dd and haven't bought a button down shirt in years until this tunic  which fits over my chest and is so flattering! many reviewers are saying that this tunic runs large--i agree  but for those of us who are busty  it's an opportunity to wear a cute  breezy style with buttons and a collar!"
-1,Where o where did the old pilcro ankle stet go??? these are a cheap impersonator. the denim used to be thick which really did wonders for the fit and overall appearance of how the denim lays over your lower half. the last 3 pairs of pilcro stets i've ordered have gone right back because they are nowhere close to the greatness they were originally. the pockets on these jeans sit so so low- completely unflattering. the ankles are significantly smaller circumferentially. the old stet ankle jeans ha
-1,I loved these pants - super soft and cozy and perfect for winter. i've worn them a handful of times and have washed them maybe twice max and they already have 2 holes! they don't say handwash and my washer/dryer is brand new and pretty gentle on my clothes. maybe i just ended up with a bad pair  but i found the quality to be disappointing :(
0,Skirt was too big in the wiast and too much fabric. was not flattering  and generally not cute enough to warrent spending 50$ to get it tailored. usual size  oop felt atleast 2 sizes too large. the pattern on the skirt  and the nuetral color is very nice. if you can find one that fits  would be a nice 3 season skirt!
-1,I should have listened to the previous review on-line before ordering. unfortunately this will go back as the design fit and proportions are simply off. i love uniquely shaped wraps like this  but this one didn't make the cut for me.
1,Fits great and just as pictured. the material is very smooth and slinky.
-1,This top is very soft and well made. for my short and curvy figure  it is very unflattering. i considered altering it  but there is no way to do it. it gapes in the front and if you have a waist at all  it won't show because this top is boxy and full in that area. if you are tall and slim  it might be perfect  so give it a try.
0,This shirt runs large. i ordered it before it was sold in stores so i didn't return it. the style is really cute. the shirt does pill.
0,Frumpy is the word i would use to describe this top. i look good in empire waist shirts and seek them out. but this one made me look pregnant and frumpy. and it has an attached camisole  but the sheerness of the top still showed my nude-colored bra strap. so i don't even know what to wear under it. it's going back  even with the sale price.
-1,Pretty fabric  nice style  took it back.
0,I liked the color of this top but i didn't really like the ruffled stitching around the middle. it looks like someone just tacked on the bottom half. i bought this for my daughter and she likes it. i think it is comfortable and a good top to knock around in.
0,"The fit is gorgeous  but i didn't realize it was completely transparent. when it says ""mesh"" it means ""mesh""! i was thinking the ""mesh"" part was on the bottom. because of how it is cut  high on the shoulders  you can't wear a cami underneath to provide coverage. very cute  but not practical."
1,I purchased this dress on a whim. it is easy to wear and very comfortable.  the empire waist is flattering. however  the dress runs large and the lower half is a-line. the neckline is very flattering and you feel put together when wearing this dress.  i am happy to have it in my wardrobe. a go-to piece for years to come.
-1,I have never written a review before  and i love retailer and shop here often. however  i am so unhappy with this shirt i wanted to share to save someone else money. it is such poor quality  it looks thick and flows in the photo  it is very thin and it itches so bad  i could hardly even stand to try it on when it came in the mail. i will deff be taking it back  and do not recommend it at all.
1,Nice fabric and cute design. a little low cut.
0,I really love the look of this jumpsuit  casual but classy. shapely but comfortable. i'm 5'4 and  similar to another reviewer  proportional torso to leg ratio. the legs were longer on me than the model in the picture  but no problem there because they're cuffed.however the arm holes are too big. my bra shows  and the particular one i got came damaged with some of the embroidery coming unraveled on the back. it's also supposed to be dry cleaned and that's annoying for casual wear. returning it.
-1,I am 5'2 107lb and an xs petite.the embroidery was the only nice thing about this dress  but everything else was really unflattering -- the huge puffy sleeves especially. another reviewer said this was more like a shift  and she was right. not worth the price on sale.
0,This dress has a nice flow and it is simple but versatile. you can pair it with a jacket or cardigan for the winter and use it year round. however it runs one size large.
-1,Looks great in the picture but when i got this in the mail the fabric was so stiff! shaking it out did nothing-almost like it was dipped in drying glue. i got this for $10 which is so cheap and i still returned it!
1,I love this dress! my bra straps do not show in the back. you can slightly see them in the front but wearing black or nude gets you around this problem. i love the slim design-it is very flattering. i tried this is my normal size 4 but also the 4 petite. the petite did not work for me since there is a larger fabric cutout for the butt area-this was too high and above my natural waste. because of this  i opted for the slightly longer option where the extra fabric was surrounding my bum. this does
1,I thought the dress in store for true to size and was a bit more 'swinging' style. i am 5'7  athletic and the small fit perfect.
1,I wasn't sure how to rate the fit on these. i tried my normal 12 and the waist fit pretty well- but there's a lot of room in the hip/pelvis area. i tried a 10 but the waist didn't fit. i can see these gathering when i sit- but i just love the print. there is no stretch in these  either. i have slim legs- if you don't  i would size up or just pass. the calf is tight.
1,I saw this dress on someone and knew immediately i had to have it.  it is stunning in person.
0,I love this piece because of its flattering stripes.i am 5' 9''  150 lbs and ordered a medium. the large was just too big  the small too short and tight  but the medium fit well. however  the sleeves are a little large which was a disappointment  and because of this there's an awkward excess of fabric on the front next to the armpits. i also experienced that the shirt is not long enough to tuck in  how the model has done.
1,Love these vintage soft jeans.. they do run small so be sure get a size larger.. i am typically a 27 and i ordered a 28... look amazing with boots  flip flops and slip ons... love mother jeans.. work every time
0,I love everything about this sweater except the sizing. i purchased the deep red in xs. the yarn weight is perfect for me (in los angeles)  the length is perfect  the sleeves are bell shaped but not at all a problem for me (they're not so big that they get in my way at all  unlike another reviewer) the collar can be folded in a way that it stands upright for a kind of retro look  which i love. the only problem is that the sweater is way too big. i can handle a wide  swingy style  but with the sl
0,I love this dress and bought it in the store in the orange  without trying it on as i usually wear a 12 in this brand.  the over-dress is beautiful  however the under-slip is very tight and is apparently made for some one who has no bust at all.  i am so sad and am considering returning it or re-sewing the slip in some way so that it fits.  not sure what to do. don't want to spoil the color combo by wearing something different underneath  but it is so sheer you need something.
-1,I really wanted to love the shorts.  when i read that the shorts were lined  i expected them to be lined so that my underwear didn't show.  even though the shorts are lined  you can see through the fabric completely.  this was absolutely disappointing since the shorts have a lovely exterior design; pockets; and  comfortable waistline.  i'm returning the shorts as well.
1,I loved this shirt from the moment i saw it on the table. i am always too tall for a peplum blouse because they hit my rib cage instead of my waist  but this shirt doesn't have that problem! i have the white one  the polka dots are a really pretty corn flower blue color. i usually wear an 8 in maeve blouses  but this one i took a 6. there is definately no give though. i have a very flat chest and only wear a lacy bralette under this shirt because there is no room for anything else. i am sad thou
-1,It's a beautiful top but not for bigger busts. ordered an xl and the top part would not button. i recommend for those with smaller busts.
1,"I am so glad i did not wait to order this dress. the fit is great and is made with great material. i am 5' 7""  110 lbs and ordered a 0. often i have to have a dress altered but it is not the case with this dress. the length falls right at my knee. it is not shown in the photos of the dress but it has a buttoned back slit that has two buttons with a bright orange trim along the slit. a very cure feature. the bright blue back drop is hard to see on the photos as well but is nice."
1,Sized up due to my 36ddd breastfeeding bust and the 14 for perfectly.  i am 5'6 and 165lbs  just fyi.  dress is super flattering on my post 4-baby body.  it's very slimming.  looking forward to wearing to a casual wedding 
-1,This was a very odd fitting top. i should have read the description more closely. the colors are beautiful but the cut hit me in all the wrong places.
-1,"I loved this color and ordered it online because i thought it would work for both casual and work days dressed up a little. ummmmm  no. it's weird and boxy and does not look at all like it does on the model. i think maybe if you have no bust whatsoever and size way down it would look okay. i'm only a 34b  weigh 110 pounds  5'3"" and it made me look huge and awkward. this is going back!"
-1,This sweater is very long  could be worn as a dress at 5'3 !
0,"The material  deep color and design are gorgeous. however  the dress is just too bulky for my 5'2"" and 110lb frame. i ordered a 0p  and it just wasn't flattering on me. it's somewhat tent-shaped so the fact that it's not at all fitted and has a thick lining made me look larger than i actually am. i'm so disappointed because the dress really is beautiful otherwise."
0,I'm writing this to warn others that these run small. i ordered my usual small and then because of the elastic waist i also ordered the medium. neither size fit me. even the medium was not only too tight in the elastic to be worn at the hip as shown  but too short waisted to be worn at the waist. they are generally smaller everywhere  which just seems wrong in this style pant. also  take note  these are slit up the side  which i could not see in the photo. it's not a high slit  but still  does c
0,I had ordered another retailer suit awhile back in an xl because my usual lg was not available  and lets say i was swimming in the xl  much to big. so when this suit came up for sale i snatched it up in lg. when i compare the two  the lg is over 4inches smaller than the xl  seems like quite a big jump in the sizing. the suit fits in the body quite well  however it's a bit snug in the side bust area. strangely  the suit has boning on the side of the bust  and also the silicone grip on the top edge 
0,Beautiful top  i love the peplum. the color is actually cream with blush accents in the lace. i gave it two stars for quality because the hem was uncut and unfinished so it's going back.
1,I got this in the color listed as pink. it's not a usual pink. the fit is good--not too tight and not too loose. the length is good for a tee.
1,I initially ordered a small  but found it looked way more oversized then what it should look like  even considering the style. (i was swimming in fabric!) i exchanged it for a petite small  and it fit perfectly. it goes so well with so many looks  and it is going to last a long while in my rotation. looks much better in person  too. my only reservation is that unlike the original one i received  this one had many threads loose throughout  which i clipped and think will be alright  but i expected
1,I got this top in the beige  size small. it is flattering and though i hadn't noticed the lace details in the back before i purchased it  they are a nice touch. this is a versatile piece. i can dress it up or down. this will definitely be a favorite of mine this season.
1,The fabric is thin  though. you better wash it in a bag or the washing machine will tear it up!
0,This t-shirt is uniquely designed and it fit well. unfortunately within an hour it shed all over. i had white fuz all over my arms and pants. i was very disappointed.
1,These short are the best! the denim is incredibly soft. they go perfect with both casual and nice tops. i would wear them out everyday if i could.
1,"Love the suit! i ordered two sizes  and this 6 ended up being too small. i'm 35x27x36 and 34d  and there wasn't enough support in the bust. read a lot of mixed reviews regarding sizing on the seafolly suits  so i'm glad i got two. suit is flattering and i love the coverage in the bottom. some boyshort suits are ""cheeky "" but these are not like that. only complaint is that while there is a pocket for the cups  they are sewn on top."
-1,This top runs huge. not only in the torso/chest area but the sleeves on this were enormous and the shoulder area was very puffy. i am normally between a m-l but would have to get a small or extra small to make it work.
-1,"These looked really interesting online and with the multicolor stripes i thought it would pair nicely with many tops.     the fabric is nice and sturdy. the colors are more vibrant than online.     the design however is terrible. when i put them on i double checked to make sure they weren't on backwards- the back is flat as a board but the front has these poofy pockets. the poor fit with the bright stripes gives a ""1920s circus diaper"" look which is not good.     they're also really tight compar"
-1,It's nice material but the design makes you look like a pregnant lady
0,Loved this jumper  i usually wear between a small and a medium in retailer (with jumpers it's mainly because of my hips and where the midline sits on my stomach)  so thought this one would probably be a medium. but it was definitely baggy/lose. otherwise i would've totally kept it!
0,The button detail on the sides is a unique design detail. i had fun playing with different looks that came with unbuttoning and buttoning the sides. but i decided against purchasing this top  it appeared shapeless on me. i have a curvier/athletic figure  and a straight up and down cut is not flattering on my figure.
0,I wanted to love this  as it seemed like a fun and carefree take on a little black dress.    but how did i not see that this has tassels? but they're there  a whole row of them - look hear the bottom of the skirt part  between the colorful stripes and the lacy area. that's a deal breaker for me - i really can't stand the way these look  and they're not the sort of thing you can easily remove.    the fabric  though nice quality  has no stretch at all. i wasn't expecting stretch  but i'd just say
1,I loved the print on both  but first bought the blue to check out the fit and feel. i went ahead and ordered the cat one today. the fit is relaxed and slightly oversized so if you want a slimmer or less boxy fit  size down. for myself  m was perfect since i'm built larger and broader on top. the top is a bit long  covers my hips and some of my bottom. it's a mixed fabric design  so the linen part may feel scratchy to sensitive types.
0,"I fell in love with these online. i thought they would be such a nice piece of statement denim. unfortunately they did not work for me. i am 5'2"" and the waist of these paints was four inches away from my breasts. it didn't look bad from the back but from the front it was comical. the denim itself is nice and heavy but  like the previous reviewer stated  not a dark wash. the pair i received was a medium whiskered wash. if i was taller these would have been a yes  despite the wash discrepancy."

-1,"Even on my 5'1""  short-waisted  100 lb body  this was super short. it was also super boxy. not flattering at all. the blue was a good color but this is going back."
0,I love the design of this dress  but found it to be an odd fit. the bow in back didn't cover my bra  and in fact  though the overall fit seemed right  the bust was tight unless i removed the bra (which is not an option in my book). i'm not large-chested  so this seemed like a design flaw to me.
1,These shorts are very well made and the embroidery work is beautiful. the dark yellow is a little bit more orangy looking than in the pictures  but is still a pretty color. don't expect any give or stretch with these shorts.
0,Customers beware  there is no lining on this dress. i love the pattern however it would be a nightmare trying to find a slip to match the dress! i ordered it on line but i'll take it back to the shop.
1,Perfect in every way- easy to wear-very feminine  comfy and goes with everything. only problem is color is not like picture. it is a mauve not a light pink. i still love this top and the color it camre in. brighten up with lipstick- necklace- earrings- whatever your pick. highly recommend. a winner!!!
-1,"The model must have this sweater pinned at the back. the sweater color is true and the material soft as anything  but the fit is ??!! at 5'9"" with a long torso and broad shoulders  the large was still shlumpy. didn't hang right at all  bunches oddly and is not the least bit flattering. my 5'7"" uber fit daughter had the same issue  and she usually makes everything that doesn't work for me look amazing. returned."
-1,I ordered this in a small petite and medium petite   and i am a huge fan of a*k. i put tried on the sp. while it fit  it was very long  even for a petite. what i hated about it was that the piping on the top made me look very wide. even a long necklace wouldn't help deter the look. on a positive side  the blue was a very nice  cool color. i am usually a small to medium in a*k (6-8 in tops) and the small fit well in the arms/bodice  just too much fabric for me. returning!
0,I really loved the pattern on this shirt and the colors were nice too. something a little different than a plain white shirt. however  it was a little boxy on me and the material was kind of stiff (i am realizing that i am a sucker for soft material?). if this goes on sale  i may purchase it again  but i did end up returning the shirt.
0,The fabric is so soft  but it was too roomy in the top and miid-section so it didn't flatter my body.
1,"Just a heads up because i didn't notice the pink in the blue motif print until it had arrived. almost sent it back - changes the overall aesthetic  makes it harder to layer in winter  black shoes stand out more etc... but i don't really like the orange print and i'm a red head... so i'm keeping it but it would have been amazing if it were cream and blue. i also bought the emerson swing dress. this dress runs tts (emerson runs a touch larger). i'm 5'5"" and the dress came to just barely above my k"
0,Absolutely love this blouse but if your a woman cursed with larger arms for your body size than this is not for you. i couldn't get the lace part of the upper arms past my elbows.  oh well  it's going back!
1,Love this kimono. design is bohemian and it will be a great layering piece. can be belted over simple black dress or layered with jeans and boots. almost didn't purchase because of the reviews concerned with fragile material but i didn't find that to be an issue once i felt the garment. great piece for fall.
1,"As others mentioned  the arm holes are a bit large- but i didn't find this too much of a problem. possibly that's because as a smaller chested woman i run into that issue regularly. i'm 5' 4"" 130 and the size 8 fit perfectly. the length is at the top of knee."
-1,Love the movement of the blouse and how it falls. great quality material.
1,This is the most intricate  delicate  beautiful dress i have seen in a long time! the pale blue  coppery brown  and dark purple tones are so complimentary of fair skin  dark hair  and light eyes. unfortunately my normal size was far too snug  especially on my hips  and this is now sold out. the fabric has no give  so i would say with any curves  size up if you can find this beauty. i'm heartbroken to be returning it!
0,This shirt is really cute and runs large. i am a true s and this shirt came as big as what i would call an l.    i get that its a boyfriend t-shirt feel but it was still surprising. if you're an s i suggest xxs and so forth.    the color is yellow but not as yellow as the picture shows.
-1,I really wanted to like this... it's soft and cozy and a nice shade of blue  but that's where the positives end. i ordered the xs and it was huge. wide  shapeless  and way too long (i'm 105lbs and 5'1). even if it came in petite  i'm not sure it's worth the price  because i can imagine the thin material losing its shape and getting stretched out.
0,This dress is beautiful. very vibrant and rich looking...however  after wearing it to work the back of the dress was completely stretched out from sitting in my office chair. when i stood up a little bubble remained around my butt. not attractive. i wanted to love it but it's going back.
1,"I am 5'3""  28/38 and got the sp. had no issues whatsoever  and love the colors."
-1,This dress hangs like a sack. it really needs a belt to give it some shape. i tried to style it with one  but then didn't look right either. i did like the slip that came with it. i'll be returning it.
0,This was a fail for me. although i ordered size large it barely fit my midsection when tied and was too small in the waist. the fabric is nice though. best on thinner frames than mine.
0,Loved the print/pattern and the light grey.....i think it might have been better if reversed (it has a v in the back  and the front neckline was very intrusive and scratchy to me). i'm normally a small but got this in a medium and it was very short on me. wish it could have worked but returning it.
-1,I loved this shirt! flattering and pretty. it's hand wash only or dry clean. i hand washed it and the blue t-shirt part of the shirt shrank  and now the front of the shirt is too short for me. would not recommend due to shrinkage... too bad.
-1,I see all the amazing reviews and on one hand  i agree with them. but these pants do run huge and they don't fit tailored like on the model. on me  they fit loose around the legs and thighs and they're super wrinkly. you'll have to iron these after every wear and every wash. i'm surprised to see the comment saying they're wrinkle resistant. they aren't. also  the kahki is more grey which i don't love. i got these on sale  but even at $50 i just can't justify keeping them. they're super comfy but
1,This is a great dress that looks better in reality than it shows on the website. the style is very flattering  fitting snug at the waist with just the right amount of flare. i am 132 pounds  34dd and i bought a size 8 and it fit great. the material is soft and flowing and the cut was true to size for me. the first time i wore it a woman walked across the restaurant to tell me how much she loved my dress. this one is a keeper.
0,I like this shirt  want to love it. i am keeping this shirt hoping to have better arms by summer when i can where this top with black shorts. this shirt does cling  it's a draping sort of fabric; i love how it drapes in the front. only because i am not happy with my arms do i where a cardi with it. also  the underarm area is rather open so i'll wear a bandeau when i wear this without a cardi.
0,So i haven't actually tried this and i'm sorry for the misleading star rating. i just wanted to get someone's attention on the length. the photos show the dress draping with almost a train even with the model in platform heels but in the video  the dress is about 2 inches off the floor. is it the model in the video that is extra tall? someone help me out. this looks gorgeous but since it's an online exclusive  i won't be able to try it on at the store.
-1,I'm so disappointed. the dress looked lovely in the box  but when i started to unbutton it to try it on  two buttons split in half! it's going right back.
0,I just received this beautiful dress in the mail after ordering my usual size petite 12. words can't describe how beautiful the fabric and embroidery appeared as i pulled the dress from the box. i quickly tried it on. the length was perfect. but when i attempted to zip the side zipper  i realized that i would never be able to zip it up over my size 38c chest. the bodice is simply too small. sadly  i have to return the dress. this is my biggest disappointment from retailer so far. if you have a ver
-1,I wanted to love this dress. it really has no style. i was expecting the smocking to be fitted but it just hung. i considered going down a size but i think the lining would have been too tight. had to return it.
-1,What a let down. the sweater i received in no way resembles the product pictured. based on the original price point  i envisioned a beautiful hand-knitted sweater made of high grade yarn/ wool that i could use for travel. instead  i received something that is grossly oversized for xs/s  made out of weird crafting yarn and looks like an ugly holiday sweater. my kids could make something better than this on their toy loom. not the quality i expected from retailer. back it goes.
-1,Fabric is not as rich as shown in photo. dress much shorter than shown in photo. shoulder area is tight and really doesn't blend with the material below. this isn't going to work on very many people - pear shape...just not what i've come to expect from retailer.
0,I saw this blouse in the store a few weeks ago and thought it was really pretty- great colors and fun beading around the wrists & hem. went online to order the petite size and when it arrived i literally couldn't believe it was the same shirt! it was so washed out compared to the one in the store and the petite size is very short (and i'm only 5 feet tall so that's saying something!). the neckline is very wide and open- not even sure what kind of bra wouldn't show?? sadly i wasted the shipping c
0,This top is pretty and i'm sad it didn't work out for me. i'm 5'9  145 lbs and i found it to be short and boxy in the torso (tried on a s  m and l). also material in the front is super staticky - i hate that feeling.
0,I saw this top on sale and tried it on right away. my normal medium was too big  so i purchased the small in the rose color. wore it with a shimmery kimono and cream colored pilcro boyfriend jeans. wow  what an outfit!!!!  then i washed it according to directions  and sadly it shrunk into a crop peplum tank. i was so disappointed. i wished i had read the reviews beforehand.
1,I visited my local retailer store to purchase a dress and left with two of these tunics.( i love browsing the retailer store  its a feast for my senses)the pavin buttyondown tunics are much more appealing in person.all three feel different due to their color and pattern. to me the burned orange feels like country and fall  the pastel grey one feels spring like and more elegant and the white one feels like summer. they all look very cute on.i did size down and still got the oversize flowing look.this
-1,If you are over 25  this top probably is not for you. it is absolutely see-thru. great style and beautiful light fabric  but you can see right thru it.
-1,3 tags - one quite huge (about 2'' by 3'') - very itchy. so i cut out the tags and they are sewn with some kind of hard poky plasticy thread - now even more itchy! i will have to wear these inside out.
-1,I tried this on in the store and was disappointed because it looked so fresh and vibrant on the hanger. but it's basically cut for model-sized people only. it's short and wide  and if you have any boobs at all it'll make the back pucker. i can't imagine this will look good on most women.
-1,I thought this skirt would fit just over the knee with a nice flowy build. instead it fit rather baggy and was longer than i expected. i felt dowdy in it.
1,These are my new favorite jeans. the gray wash is nice  and the distressing is subtle enough that i can wear these to work. the rise is high enough that i don't need to worry about bending over but not so high that they get near my belly button. and the description is true: they don't stretch! i'm a loyal ag stevie shopper  and the fit on these is similar... just a little skinnier in the ankles  maybe. true to size. a little long  so i'll probably hem them a couple of inches.
0,I ordered this item when it was first advertised  fell in love with the unique pattern in the top and could hardly wait for it to get here. however when i received the top i was very disappointed  the fabric is cheap  the sleeves are tight and the overall product is of poor quality and poorly constructed. needless to say i returned it.
0,I thought this top would be a nice addition to my fall wardrobe  and while the color didn't disappoint  everything else did. it's a very loose slub so it's very see through and thin  i'd have to wear a cami under it. also the tie front has a very high slit! like it went almost halfway up the shirt and definitely would have shown skin unless you layered the shirt. i do think this top would be a cute throw on top for yoga/ gym wear  but definitely not at this price. pass for me sadly...
1,"I have a casual oceanside wedding to attend and thought this easy  yet elegant dress would be a good purchase. i initially bought two sizes: 10 and 12. i'm typically a 12 in more structured dresses (i.e.  more rigid fabric with zippered entry) but because this dress was flowy and slipped on over the head  i also ordered the 10. i'm 5'5""  broader shoulders  36d  with smaller hips that are typically one size smaller than my top half. the 12 ended up being comically huge and fit like a tent. the 10"
0,Like it; but it's quite short and rather boxy. i'll keep it because it's pretty versatile.
-1,I really loved this in the catalog. the fabric and details are very pretty. however it's a lot of fabric without much form. my husband suggested it for maternity (not realizing it has fitted slip). not for curvy/ hourglass.  had to send it back.
1,Nice top; the material is soft and drapey. i like to wear it layered under a shorter shirt or jacket.
1,"It's a nice casual dress that you can also dress up  but unfortunately it is going back. i got a small since dolan dresses always run large  but i usually get a petite. i should've known this wouldn't work. i wanted to love it because the top looks great  but the length is too long making the waist fall lower than i would like giving my middle a thick appearance.i'm thin  but i'm not skinny  5'3"" with an athletic build and a short torso with a decent size bust...if that helps. usually i can wear"
1,This vest is a stunner! the dark brown suede is so beautiful. the bronze grommets on the front are a perfect enhancement to the vest. it's hard to see in the picture but the stitching is also top notch. yes  it is a little pricey but it's an investment piece that you will wear and not only get a ton of compliments but feel special when wearing it too. it's a keeper!!!
0,This dress is the perfect combination of bohemian chic. however  the slip below the dress runs a tad bit small. i have a wide rib cage and normally wear between a 04-06. the dress would have been just perfect if the slip was a bit larger.
1,"Really like the quality  color  and overall design of these jeans. they ran a little long on me  but i just cut off an inch from the bottom and they fit perfectly with some tall booties. i didn't need to get them altered because the design of them is that they are cut at the bottom and are a little frayed. so  glad that was the case given the price tag on them. i am 5'7""  128 lbs and wear a size 28 which fit perfectly except for the length which was easily fixed. definitely recommend these jeans"
1,"This dress is so gorgeous! it fits perfectly  is stretchy  wonderful  comfortable  and the fabric is nice and thick with beautiful texture. i absolutely love it! i'm 5'6""  125 lbs  with a pretty athletic build  and it fits like a dream! i love the color  the fabric  the fit  the stretch  the comfort  the sexyness of it..... it's my new favorite! highly recommended!"
1,"I love this sweatshirt. it's super chic and sexy (and for those of us that need actual support  it looks great with a strappy sports bra).  that said  selling this as ""one size fits all"" is misleading  at best.  i'm 5'2  ~160 (a lot of it muscle  but i enjoy chorizo)  a 34ddd  and this fit me perfectly  but i can't imagine it would work for anyone much larger than a size 12.  just be real -- this is a smedium.     one star removed for the ""one size fits all"" fallacy."
1,I love this tank! its something you can dress up with a skirt  or wear over jeans. i like loose fitting tops  although i have a slender frame. this is also so comfortable. i went with a size medium  and it fits perfect.
1,In truth  it looks better in the photo. i am sure it was a great value for the money i spent. however  i am keeping it because it will match perfectly with a pair of satin pants i want to wear to holiday parties.
1,I bought this dress because it looked sooo comfy. and it is! the fabric feels nice and it fits loose without feeling like a burlap sack. it's perfect for running around town for errands. i actually didn't think my boyfriend would like it because he generally likes more form-fitting pieces (yes  big surprise) but he actually commented out of the blue that it's really sexy. comfy *and* sexy?! score!
0,Overall: soft material  cute pattern - but definitely a return as just didn't fit right.     fit: i am a six in most tops and based on the size chart - i ordered the size small. it fit comfortably around my bust - but the cup placement was basically at the center of my chest - so that my breasts were squished uncomfortably and unflattering in the middle. i've lost a bit of weight recently - so i'm more of a 36a  than 36b these days - but this wouldn't work for me or i imagine anyone with a broad
1,"Loved the look of the blouse online but the one i received has weird pattern placement that i'm not a fan of. mine was mostly cut from the ""mum/sunflower"" patterned fabric and none of the pretty teal and red pattern. the shirt online as a good combo of patterns-- mine is a solid mrs. roper-all-over-flower print! way overboard!! that said-- the cut is cute and the yoke at the back is a nice detail-- hoping i can exchange it for one that looks more like the online pic!"
1,I ordered one size down and it's still plenty roomy. as others have said  the sleeves are a tighter fit  but there is a tiny bit of stretch to the fabric. i'm smaller busted and didn't want the v-neck to get too low  so i sized down one. very cute tucked into jeans or paired with leggings.
1,I just purchased this top in the store. it is definitely not tunic length as shown here  but rather hip length. also it runs a little small in the bust and had to go up a size. but it is adorable.
-1,This dress didn't work for me at all. i'm 6ft tall  160lb  i usually wear size l 8/10  but based on the reviews i ordered an m. the material of this dress is very soft and fuzzy  color is about the same as pictured  also length is appropriate. dress is very thick and warm  the fabric however has no stretch at all  dress is very specious and shapeless. there is allot of room everywhere except shoulders & sleeves  i thought that area was tight & snug which is strange because it runs large everywhe
-1,I also returned this dress after waiting weeks to received it.  i had high hopes for this dress as i really loved it online but what a disappointment when i got it.  the fabric is made of cheap poly that's shiny  thin  and clingy.  it shows every lump and bump you have.  the zipper at the back won't lay flat and keeps bunching up creating an ugly bump.  the sewing and hemline is uneven.  there wasn't a lot of thought put in in the print placement where the seams was sewn together in the midline
0,This runs huge  not large  huge; and hung in quite a baggy way. bought a medium ( 5'10  150 lbs) and i could have gotten an x-tra small. maybe if there were free shipping i would have reordered  but now its just too much of a hassle
-1,I love the fit of these pants -- they're the perfect slim black pants. however  i wore these pants exactly three times before the seams split the middle of the pant in not just one  but multiple places. disappointed by the workmanship/quality of the product  especially since the pants fit amazingly and don't sag like other slim fitting black pants tend to do. i hope retailer will take this into consideration and improve the quality of future iterations of this product.
-1,"I bought the red motiff in my usual size of xxs petite and it was huge. at first i thought they had mistakenly sent the wrong size but this was sadly not the case. the fit is definitely ""sack-like"" as other reviewers mentioned. i had to return."
1,"These are super soft and relaxed. i have them in navy and lavender. i am 5'6"" and 130 lbs. and ordered them in a 28  which fits loosely  but comfortably."
0,"The tag on the jeans said ""won't stretch out""  and i've already returned one pair to size down when they stretched out by the end of the first wear. ive been wearing the smaller size for a week  and it's stretching out as well. the crotch ends up dropping two or 3 inches and i keep having to hike the pants up in public  after just a week of owning them. i love paige jeans  and the cut and color of these are amazing. i'm going to have to size down one last time just to get them to stay up  i hope"
-1,I saw this one for the first time today in-store and was not impressed. it is a lacey material with an under-layer  so with a different cut other than a swing dress i would have fallen in love and it would have been absolutely gorgeous. unfortunately  i did not like the swing dress cut  especially not in white. i wasn't sure if the designer was going for a throw back to the 70s or a shortened version of my grandmother's wedding gown  but either way it was not working for me. to be fair  swing dr
-1,I ordered this top in a 14  my usual size  and it fits fine  but it is way too short-waisted! it looks nothing like what the model is wearing. her top comes low on her waist  almost to her crotch area. mine was just about 2 inches below my belly button! it was almost as if they accidentally cut off the lower half of the top at the factory! very strange.
-1,I recommend this dress because it is beautiful  stylish and well made even though it did not work for me. i tried the small and extra small. the first - way too big  lengthwise (hit my knees) as well as in the shoulders - the latter to tight across the chest - not for me but worth a try. i am typically a small with usually never have a problem with length.
0,I thought this was a sweet design but it is too boxy for me.

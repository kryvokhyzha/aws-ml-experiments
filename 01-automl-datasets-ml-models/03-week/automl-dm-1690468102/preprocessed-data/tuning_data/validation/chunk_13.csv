0,I really wanted to love this top. i got it in xs in peach. the color is beautiful. i wish they had this exact same color in the boardwalk stroll top. the v neck was way too low and i don't want to have to wear a tank underneath. i would be willing to try an xxs but it's been sold out for awhile now and looks like it's not coming back. if the size were smaller  v neck higher up  and the top portion of the dress more fitted  it would be the perfect tee!
1,Love this coat - great fall piece! i bought the green color and it looks as shown in the picture. great retailer purchase!
1,"As the title suggests  i am very skeptical and scared of pencil skirts. i'm slim (sz 0) and on the shorter side (5'4'')  but i have ""dramatic hips""  so i've always had a testy relationship with any clothing that exaggerates them. i'm obsessed with uniquely designed skirts thought  so i had to try this and i am so pleased i did!  the fit is great and not too tight  allows for a little room for ladies with hips. i only wish the zipper went down a little further so shimmying out of it were a little"
1,I bought this cuz i wanted a plaid shirt that didnt have too much plaid..this is true to size and adorable! i will be wearing it out and not to bed or for lounge. adorable detailing on back and on shoulders...its a keeper!
-1,"Loved how this draped and im super petite 5'1""(32b bust) and this was seriously one of the most ill fitting items i have every owned. i purchased the pxs and it was huge. i hope this has a better fit as the other reviewers seem to have a more positive review. i was just appalled as to how bad the measurements were off. unfortunately the straps are not adjustable so this went below my chest. too sad retailer  please get the fit right!!"
0,These are the very stretchy  almost spongy  type fabric.  i ordered my usual size and they fit me like a sausage skin.  crazy small!!!
-1,It is a shame when a product such as this is left on the website after so many comments reveal the item to be more defective in production than an opinion of size proportion. i read the reviews so had expected the item to run small so i ordered accordingly...this does not run small-this is not representative of any of the three categories one associates with women's apparel sizing. i am usually a small and the description by previous reviewers described the fit as being perfect for me-very small
1,I love this dress! it's super comfortable and can easily be dressed down with a jean jacket and some sandals  or dressed up with leather and a good pair of heels. the fit is spot on and very slimming  and i like that the length isn't too short as well.
-1,The fit of this sweater did not flatter my body-type. the top half did not fit well; the armpit area was loose fitting and the neckline was awkward.
1,I tried on the xs in store in crimson (i would need petite) - the color and fit were very flattering on me (pale skin). the dress feels very silky  i love the back  how it ties  and how high the neckline was on me in the front. the little flutter at the bottom of the dress is also a nice touch. my only concern was whether this looked like a negligee... i think i would buy it if i had somewhere to go  just not sure the fabric is appropriate for work...     reference: 115 lbs  30dd  26.5 in waist.
0,I guess i am in a comfort clothing mood these days since i have been looking at a lot of them lately! this one is a nice thicker material and i like that the sleeves go all the way down  but i am not a fan of the design. i felt the color scheme was very plain. the neckline comes up higher on me than i would have expected and makes me feel like i am choking. it is not a flattering cut on me and does not accentuate anything i would want it to  nor does it hide imperfections. it truly is comfort we
1,Loved pattern   quality and fine details on this dress but  it ran large. i ordered petite small and it was way too loose/baggy .i had to return it.  i went bsck to order a petite x/small  but it was no longer available in this size on- line. so disappointed!     fyi    i'm 5'   112-115lbs and small boned -always wear size petite small . but not fir this dress!     this dress is comfortable   well made  lined and pattern is extremely pretty with nice border ( which is hard to find for petites -a
-1,Cup size is really small for a medium. no way to adjust the back strap. ended up giving it to my daughter. cute but so poorly executed.
0,I really wanted to love this dress. the striped material was very nice and would go with so much plus the length was great. however  the buttons were a nightmare. the buttons are barely in the button holes and give very easily. the linen material is going to give even more with wear and the button holes are sure to loosen up even more. as i was trying the dress on and moving around two different buttons gave way on me. maybe the very slender will be able to wear this without buttons sliding out
-1,I received this top in the mail today not what i expected at all! it is a great fabric just way too much of it. it is proportionally incorrect width wise. unfortunately this one will be going back.
-1,Terrible fit for a longer torso.  runs small in hip and lining  huge in the waist.  not good for an hourglass figure!
0,As with many of retailer's tops these days  there is a lot of fabric on this tee. it hangs fairly well  though. the white color is cream  which didn't work for me but isn't bad. a little sheer but wearable with a nude bra. if you have a thinnish upper body  order down a size!
1,"Got this in the ""dark blue"" wash; there is significantly less color variation than pictured online; it's a medium wash  and incredibly soft. i typically wear m or l in this brand due to very broad shoulders and muscular biceps: if you have a similar frame and you typically wear one of two sizes  go with your larger size.  this feels incredibly silky. it's lightweight  so it can be worn (almost) year-round and will layer well over say  a tissue-style turtleneck in the winter. it's longer in the b"
-1,Not a coat by any means  merely a thin wool boucle like sweater with a cheap thin synthetic lining ---and i also would never want the lining to be seen by anyone if i were to set the sweater on a chair or be helped in putting the thing on. the length and bulk is hard to layer under anything else and isn't pretty enough for a spring coat..sizing is also 2 sizes larger than anticipated.
0,I purchased these in a 26 petite and a 26 regular. the 26r was too long and bunched up terribly pass the knee. they were also loose in the waist and overall body. the 26p fit great in the waist and body  however; past the knee it was too tight and again it bunched but not as bad as the 26 reg. the overall quality of the jean seems fairly good. the fit just did not work for me so these go back and the hunt continues for white jeans. would love it if they made the hyphen jeans in white.
0,This is a thick sweater. it is pretty  but has a short length.
-1,Wanted to like this top but it looks terrible and does not lay right. the bust line is not tight enough to contrast the rest of the top being flowy. does not give any shape to the body. do not recommend for anyone with a medium to large chest.
-1,I'm usually a fan of maeve  but this dress is just bad. the fabric is thin and filmy  and it stretches to sheer over your chest. the turtleneck is neither tight nor loose  it just droops in a most unfortunate way.
0,This dress looked really nice on the hanger but when i put it on it was shorter than expected. i am 5'9 and it hit way above the knees. too short to be a work dress which was what i was hoping. might work better on someone shorter.
-1,Beautiful fabric! unfortunately  i had to return it. after just one wear  it had pills all over the side. fabric is too delicate. sad to return!
0,Purchased this top because of the sale. i got it in the peach and the maize. i think it is big  boxy  and loose but at the sale price it is not a bad top to have. the colors are vibrant and striking. pretty with shorts and capris. i did size down from 2 to 0
0,I so wanted to love this dress  despite the reviews. when i opened the package i fell in love with the fabric. the print is absolutely beautiful and the fabric feels luxurious. the dress fit perfectly but there was just too much fabric (even though i absolutely loved the fabric). the flowing overlay was just too much. i am returning it.
-1,This is exactly the same cut as the breton peasant blouse  which i also ordered. it's extremely tight thru the bust and the sleeves are very wide at the top which adds width to the look of this blouse. it added 20 pounds! the print is beautiful. the ruffles are trimmed with a golden colored thread which is a beautiful detail. i ordered size large and am well endowed. steer clear if you have a bust.
0,I sized up based on other reviews which was good advice. i am typically a size 6 but sized up to a 10. the pants are very unique and i think on the right body type would look amazing. it seems like someone with curves and a small waist might fit these splendidly...but that's not me. i had some extra material puffing about in the zipper region. i also expected the material to be thicker but found it to be more silky.
-1,I love the colors. however  $200 is a lot to pay for a small piece of fabric   no lining what so ever. the fabric is very thin. you will need a slip. looks just like a cover-up. going back.
-1,"When i saw this online i immediately put it on my ""must buy"" list. i hate paying the exorbitant shipping fees retailer charges so i was waiting until i could get to my local store  in the meantime it looks like it has sold out online but i am sure it will be back in stock soon. luckily  my b&m store had it and i am so glad i didn't waste my money or time ordering it online. this could have been great but once again antho missed the mark. what the product shot online doesn't show is that it has dol"
1,Tried this little number on in store...... i am 51 years old..... not a bad body.... gave this a shot. it looks minus my slightly wrinkled knees great ....and very close to what it looks like on model. very happy with one!!!
1,I really like this top! it's lightweight  great quality  and i've worn it for casual weekend outings and also dressed up for work.
1,Love this dress. i wear a size large  but had to return and order a medium  planning to wear with boots. it's a light dress  cute for work. the only downside is that it wrinkles easily.
1,I love this shirt so much i bought it in another color. it looks like it does in the picture  loose and flowy.
0,I wanted to love this dress  and thought it would be perfect for a barn wedding i have coming up. it was allllllmost right but sadly fell short. the bib that hangs over the bust hits in a really unflattering mid point that makes you look wide. nipple tassels effect. plus i would feel the urge to keep pulling it down. did notice some of the puckering others mentioned but didn't bother me  however  the way the lining and the dress line up at the bottom did. so close  so sad
-1,I was really looking forward to receiving this blouse in the mail. the color was beautiful in person and the photo does not show the nice beading around the neck. that being said  i was so disappointed in the fit. i ordered a size 00 and the arm length was way too long yet the body of the shirt was way too cropped. cropped enough where you could see skin on the sides. made no sense! hoping to order a few more sizes to see if i can find the right fit. order up for length  down for arm length ...
-1,I took the advise of a reviewer and sized down to xs. i am 5'6 and 110. i could take them off without unbuttoning them  they were hugh  even the xs! they looked like a halloween costume. even at the discounted sale price  awful and kind of made me laugh. but i guess that's why they are still available at this sale price.
1,I have these in 3 colors and i always wear a 27 in pilcro. i could probably size down but i like them a little loose. they are great to have in the spring and summer. they are very soft and very comfy.
1,Ordered this in my typical size  xs  and it fits perfectly. the weather hasn?t cooled off enough for me to wear it on a daily basis  but after just trying it on i can say that it fits really nice. the sleeves are a knit material which make them very forgiving and the jacket easy to wear. plus  there is enough room for me to wear a tee-shirt or thin blouse underneath. ordered the slate color and it is a very beautiful neutral  brown that should go with almost anything.
0,Nice dress  but the leather seats of my car were ruined when the sharp metal beads on the back made deep scratches~ not fun at all. now i must carefully take them out  bad design feature.
1,I had read all the reviews about the regular length being too long (they were out of stock on the petite when i ordered) but i took a chance and ordered the regular size. i love it! it is a little long in the back  but i think that makes it a little more fun than your standard plaid shirt. so cute with skinny jeans and leggings! it is one of my favorite fall tops! i got the blue but might go back and get the red since it would be so great for the holidays!
-1,Ordered the biggest size available  the large. the arms are so tight  i couldn't get it on. looked like it may have fit in the body so i don't understand why so constricting in the arms. i don't have big arms  either. fabric is thin but the color is pretty. can't recommend. i'd pass on this one.
1,This shirt looked so perfect on the model  and i was so excited to get it! when i received it  it was so soft and the color was so vibrant. the only thing is  it's too big. it kind of looks like a maternity shirt. it will definitely have to be taken in on the sides for me  but i'm happy with it other than that. i'm normally a l/xl but m would have been perfect this time.
-1,These shorts just didn't work for me. i loved the embroidery and the color  but i just don't have the curves for them. try these if you have an hourglass or fuller figure.
0,I love the design of this sweater and ordered it online  but was disappointed with the quality of the yarn when it arrived. also the color was a little different than i expected from the photo  still a type of ivory  but a little yellow-y. the sweater was solid looking  but the yarn seemed a bit cheap and i'm not sure how well it would have worn over time. flattering cut. i liked how it fit  but for the price and fabric  i decided to return it. unfortunate to lose money on shipping.
0,"I like the design and the color of the cardigan (i got green). i like the details on the back. the cardigan is tts  the shoulder width and sleeves length seems perfect (for reference: 5'7""  125 lb  got size s).    the problem for me is that the cardigan is not as long as it looks in the photos for the rose color; the pictures for the beige show the length more accurately. it may work for a smaller lady  but i like my cardigans a bit longer and cozier.    also  it is not just that the material is"
1,I love anna sui's lines makeup to everything. this dress is beautiful in a very usual sort of way and after trying it on  i couldn't see anything spectacular that made it unique or special somehow. the elastic waist does make this dress forgiving and it runs big. the hem is lovely scalloped. each detail is very nice in and of itself but when put together in this dress  there is no wow that justifies the full price tag. now that it's on sale i'll keep it probably for summer.
1,These fit quite well  and it's rare that i find shorts that fit well without being too tight. great for spring or summer. fits tts.
1,"Runs large in arm holes. have to wear bandeau. love this print and flow of dress. loose but still flattering due to arms and shoulders . love the overall look. midi length for this 5'6.5"" gal. size s worked best -36c-125lbs"
0,I wear a size 4 and i ordered the small for this top. it is huge and gave me a maternity-look that i wasn't going for. i was hoping for a loose  body-skimming fit as shown on the model in the picture but that wasn't happening with this top.
0,The fit is a bit loose in the body (more than you can tell on the model) - more like a true swing style top. i feel the arms are a good fit  but i ordered one size up from my normal since i'm planning to wear this as a maternity top. arms are definitely a size smaller than the body. the ruffles at the bottom are a bit odd  but overall i still like it. the cutout notch at the collar is super cute! plus  the green color of this top is lovely and i love that it's made in the usa so i'll be keeping
0,I wanted to love this dress because the fit is so flattering and the color is so great however i could not get the button along my bust to lay flat. normally this can happen if the fit is too tight around the bust but i promise there was still plenty of room. the fabric just bent in a way that left a gaping hole at my bust. unfortunately it's going to have to go back.
1,Couldn't resist the polka dots! very cute and stylish cardi. since i'm short waisted this cropped style is perfect for me. i tried on the xs and small and while there wasn't a huge difference i went with the small since it had a bit more room. it's pricey so i waited for a sale to purchase!
-1,"I'll start by saying the fabric and concept are beautiful. the top is sheer  but that's pretty clear in the images and not surprising for a lightweight white blouse. the problem is that the arms are more fitted and the torso (not the chest  but the mid-section) is cut fairly wide. i'm 5'10""  140#  34b and usually wear a 4 or a small/medium depending on how relaxed i want the fit. i purchased this in a 4. the arms were workable but slightly fitted  and the torso fit like an 8. chest was as expect"
-1,I purchased this sweater in my usual xs  but found the silhouette to be way more tent-like than pictured on the model. the knit is pretty stiff  too  so the sweater didn't lay flat but hung on me in kind of a triangle shape. also  the sweater knit was heavier than i expected from the picture and seemed to be more of a fall weight piece. i am fairly small  but lately i'm finding that retailer pieces are huge in an xs and i have to size down to xxs. i know i'm not that tiny ... maybe this wou
-1,I saw this at the store today. very excited about it but i had no idea how to get it on! there is a side zipper so i attempted to step into the jumper through the collar but could never get my arms through! from what i could see on my body  it would have been too short in the crotch. i decided not to fight with it to put on entirely. i gave up. cute shade of green though.
1,"The picture does not do this swing sweater any justice. first of all  the colors are much more vibrant in person than in the picture. the description says it is a ""yellow motif""; there is absolutely no yellow in it. a bit of khaki in two rows of plaid  but no yellow. the predominant colors are a rich maroon  which is so popular this season  some bright blue and salmon colors  which does not come out in the picture. rich and beautiful.    secondly  the sweater is sassy on -- just plain fun. i am"
-1,The cut of this dress is gorgeous and it could be great if it were made of quality silk and was lined. although the color is beautiful  the cheap fabric has no variation  is too saturated  and lacks any sheen of quality silk.   shocked at the price. i still have beautiful silk dresses from retailer pre 2010 . being back the quality!
1,I am so glad i read the reviews for this before i purchased it. i am 5'5 and 135 pounds and normally wear a size 6 in dresses. i would normally buy a small  but sized down to an xs and it was perfect! it's a beautiful dress and very flattering!
0,I love the pattern of this shirt but there is definitely a design flaw in the arm/armpits.
0,"Cute print on both sides  but far more ""cheek"" was exposed than i anticipated from the photos. the front isn't too skimpy  but the back is a bit too small for my taste. definitely narrower in the back than a standard bikini cut. too bad :( the matching top is my favorite top  so i guess i'll just have to wear black bottoms with it."
-1,This runs way big  i'm a size 8  purchased the medium. it's just big with no shape.
-1,This jacket has cute details. i like the front pockets and color. it has no shape and is about 1 size bigger than marked. i felt like a sack of potatoes in it.
0,"I thought this was such a beautiful cardigan from the online photos. i ordered it in the small size but the fit is strange. the arms and wrist cuffs are so large it cannot be pushed up to stay out of the way for things i would like to do when wearing it (i'm a teacher and my classroom is that kind of environment). i was also confused by the front ""collar"" ribbing and how it was supposed to lay - open  folded over  partly folded over - it just didn't seem to have a particular style to this area."
1,I have this in darker blue and it is my favorite dress of the season. i didn't realize that there was one in turquoise until it was already sold out. please bring back or be so kind to contact me if an xs comes in as a return  etc.   i love this so much!
0,I love the material of this shirt and i love the design; however  there is just too much fabric. it felt very boxy and gave me no shape at all. for someone who is petite this just wasn't flattering. i love the design idea though!
1,Finally saw this dress online. i have to say that it looks better in person. the model might be too tall for this dress. i am 5'4''. it's right to my ankle. the color is in a nice off white. the material is a good quality. the overall cut is nice. it's a kind of classic feeling.you could wear it for a long time without going out of style.
1,"This is a beautiful dress! the color is really great and i love the cut - flattering around the neckline and loose and flowy.     the one downside is that it is pretty long. i am 5'6"" and usually somewhere between and xs and s for dresses  so went with the xs. the size is great but it's just a tad long for wearing with flats. i actually think if i was bustier the length would be fine  but since i'm pretty flat there's nothing to fill the dress! i wish i had been able to snag a petite  but they w"
0,Love pilcro jeans and really hoped these would work for me. lovely soft material (98% cotton/2%  which you don't see often anymore!)  great length  nice medium rise but for me the deal breaker was the lack of belt loops. the braided detail at the waist is a fun design touch  but as someone with a small waist and wider hips  i almost always have to wear a belt with jeans and that's just not possible with these. if you don't usually wear a belt or have a straighter figure  these might work better
-1,"In the words of my husband  ""looks like you're wearing a bag."" i'm althetic and short. maybe this works best on tall and very slim?"
0,"This was my favorite shirt before i ordered it .... i absolutely couldn't wait to wear it.  but i was so disappointed.  at 5'2"" and 120 i have a athletic frame ... the small was tight in the shoulders but had so much extra fabric that i felt lost.  i wasn't wearing the shirt .... it was wearing me."

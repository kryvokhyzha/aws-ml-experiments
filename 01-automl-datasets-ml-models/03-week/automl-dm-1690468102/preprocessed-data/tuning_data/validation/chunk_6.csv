-1,I agree with the other reviewer. the colors were fabulous  but it was boxy and fit me like a sack. the slits on the side really detracted from the cute fabric and the hood drooped way in the back due to being able to pull away from the slits. it was really a cute idea and i'm sad it didn't work. i started not to order it based on the first review but i wanted to give it a chance --i should have listened !
1,"I tried on the regular size at my store and it was too long for me  te sleeves were enourmous  and the dress fell mid-calf. but  i love the feel of hte mateiral  and if it were to fit properly  is very falttering. i will order the petite size later on to try  i liked it enough for that. the ""blue"" is a nice teal color. double layer  and extremely comfortable. the finish is laser cut  no stichting."
1,Love love love. fits great. super comfortable and looks both casual and dressy at the same time. i could wear this every single day.
0,"The colors of this dress are beautiful and i really wanted to love it but it wasn't cut for my body shape. i think you either need to be curvy to fill out the chest or straight up&down to have it lay flat (as in the model). ordered size 6: 34b  150 5' 9""  tall/slim build. i also think the hi/lo hem of the dress isn't well indicated in the pictures; i'm not a fan of the style and was hoping it would be minimal however the hem is definitely asymmetric."
1,Really nice green blend of colors. fun style but not especially figure flattering as it is a very wide peplum. i still love it and goes with many outfits and as a fall jacket. is a bit itchy. need to wear sleeved top or dress underneath.
-1,"So these look so good online - i love flare and the button detail. however  on me  they were very long (which i knew) but too thigh-hugging for my taste  and the buttons looked cheap (i ordered the tan color). thus  back they went. for reference  i am 5'5"" and 125# and ordered the 6."
0,This just wouldn't lay right on me. the top is really too big. maybe if you're really busty  this is great  but not for me. i know the top is supposed to be a bit blousy  but it was huge and droopy and unflattering (not like in the picture). the arm holes were too big and hung down so you could see my bra  which i really hate and which is way too common lately. the bottom half fit perfectly  so sizing up or down would not have helped. the material is super light and comfy  which i liked very muc
0,The breast and arm area is too tight. best to size up two sizes. the blouse runs too small overall. the color is a darker blue than pictures in the photo. it's a pretty blouse  and great quality.
-1,I ordered the shirt bc it looked soo cute despite the fact many said this shirt was see thru. it's true.. had to return it
1,Love love these jeans. they are just the right rise and the straight leg is perfect. the color of the demin is great to wear to work. the fit is great.
0,I ended up returning it just because it didn't do much for my current postnatal figure  but otherwise this top is just so pretty and unique!
1,These have a great fit & design. i ordered a size larger after reading that this style runs on the small size. typically i'm a 27 but ordered a 28. the wash has a great vintage feel about it! i also love that these do not lose their shape after wearing all day.
1,"The material of the lace is nice and soft  it is not a stiff lace. i am 5'6"" 36dd 146lbs and ordered the small. it fits perfect not tight through bust or the arm holes. i wore today for the first time and everyone that sees the top loves it as much as i do. i ordered the white and in the pictures it looks like a bright white  it is not. it is more of an antique white and i am wearing a nude colored camisole and it works perfect. i think it will be really cute with a colored cami also. this will"
-1,"Wanted to love this- i did love the color and thought the style would work for anyone. but i tried it on and immediately took it off with a definite ""not keeping this."" the side zipper- a complaint by many  really made it uncomfortable. also  the detail under the bust would not lay flat and just looked odd. loved the material and definitely the green print. but i knew i would never wear it. just looked blah."
1,Dress is very flattering on  not tent-like at all!
0,"When i received this dress today i was really excited to try it on. it is a pretty dress. looked good in the pictures. however  when i examined it and proceeded to try it on  i was really disappointed. the quality is ok  but not expected for the price paid. and the cut is off. it is extremely small at the top. i am not big by any means( 32d 109lbs  5'0""). the bottom part fit. sadly  not impressed. this one is going back :("
-1,I love this top (so cute and comfy!)  but i wore it twice  washed it once on gentle and layed to dry.....now there are 2 small holes in the front. for as much as it cost  i would have expected it to be more durable. very disappointing  especially since i don't live near an retailer and can't take it back easily......
1,"This is a very nice jacket in a pretty textured fabric. it seems to fit tts  and the cut is very flattering. however - the ""white"" is actually ivory. not a big deal  unless you were trying to match an outfit with pure white in it. still on the fence about whether to keep it or not."
0,I purchased the blouse in both the ivory and black. the black i decided to keep because it will go with anything. i was hoping the ivory blouse would work but it's thin and see through. if someone could please tell me where i could find a casual  white or ivory blouse that is not entirely see through i would greatly appreciate it!
-1,Love the idea of this top  but it is so thin and the sequins look so cheap. the quality reminds me of something you would buy for $20 at a market abroad. definitely disappointed with the quality for the price. will be retuning.
0,Definitely was disappointed in the fit of this potentially very cute shirt. just too large; too much fabric for me. i'm usually an xs and there was just no shape to that size for my small bod. i wouldn't have minded the longer length if there had been a better fit up top. i think the colors are also a bit duller in person. love the concept though!
0,Construction excellent. the dress was pretty big around the hip...does not have a shape like seen in the picture. the fabric was beautiful but was stiff...like furniture. the color was not as vibrant as the picture. returned.
-1,"I ordered this in my usual size small (36b bust  5'5""  around 116 lbs)  but the seam around the high waist stuck out and didn't cinch in at the waist at all  rather bubbled out a bit. the tunic ""flaps"" laid strangely as well  like they were too small almost. the high cut sides were indeed high cut...showing the waistband of my leggings. apparently that is a new style  as i have seen a few other tops like it around  but i question whether slits that high are appropriate for actual wear outside on"
-1,These are way oversized! i have several pairs of pilcro jeans and these run way too large. wasted money on shipping. won't do that again:(
1,Not long ago  i bought a pair of hei hei pants that i love  so when i saw these  i immediately tried them on. i love them too. they are pretty and comfortable  and i am so happy to get away from tight jeans! they are also very flattering. size wise  i find that i have to size down with hei hei  perhaps because they have a looser cut.
0,This dress could have been great but for me there was too much design on the top part/ front. i wish the neckline was different or just less beadwork/ design near my face.  all in all its a maxi dress and was returned because approx. $250 was too much to spend on this.
0,I loved this top when i wore it! it draped beautifully. i always snatch up all of bordeaux t-shirts because of the way they hang. but beware - you must dry this flat. i've always had no problem washing and drying their t-shirts  but this one shrunk up to half it's size the first time i washed it and is no longer wearable. it does say on tag lay flat to dry and they mean it!
-1,This is one of those dresses that looks so cute on the model but doesn't look anything like that in reality. it has no shape and it fits weirdly all over. i am normally a m and i ordered the s and it is massive.
0,The lining is shorter than the top  so i keep pulling it down. also the finishing of the edges looks like a child cut it with some scissors. it is not evenly cut. i do like the color and style of the shirt  just not the quality.
-1,I am pregnant and i thought this would be a great sleep bra. it's soft and fits okay  but it has zero support or shape. i would only buy if you are a b cup or smaller and can get away without support. if i would have seen this is the store  i would have passed over it. however  i was too lazy to return so i am wearing it. it's comfortable so that's a redeeming quality. i would not recommend for larger chested ladies  though!
-1,This didn't work for me. im normally a m (8/10). got this in xs. that was the correct size for me  i believe. however  the armholes were huge. husband said the top of the dress looked like the autobots symbol from transformers and he wanted me to keep it. but  i sent it back.
-1,"The color of the sweater is beautiful  but the fit was awful. it was too ""swingy"" and made me look like i gained 10lbs instantly  (i'm 5'1""  108lbs). i will be unfortunately returning this item."
0,I got this as a gift and one for me. the medium fits my mom but i got the large because i'm 6'1 and it was large enough but so short waisted. i wouldn't recommend it for women over 5'7
0,Loved the look of this shirt on the hanger. however when on  i found that it puffed out in the back. it's fitted through the shoulders and mid-back but the bottom rounds out and creates a lower hump. maybe it wouldn't on someone taller? also  although this wasn't a con for me  the shirt is darker than appears online.
0,I bought the cream version online  as the blue was sold out. i was rather disappointed to see that the cream is just a glorified sweatshirt. there are no dots  it it just the heathered cream of any normal sweatshirt. i do  however  like the design and the fit of the sweatshirt. i am sad that is was not clear (in the photos or in the name) that the cream version was not dotted. i am still deciding if i will keep the shirt. i love the design and fit  but the plain boring sweatshirt was not what i
1,"I love drop shoulder sweaters and find them to be very flattering so i took a chance on this one despite the reviews stating it runs very large. i was attracted to the style as well as the natural cotton fiber  which i find holds up best over time. i am 34b and usually wear xs or small and in this i ordered the xs. it fits perfectly! i layered this soft pink sweater over a rounded hem tee with a black and white pattern; so cute! it is slightly short on my 5'8"" frame so the shirt tail hems peeked"
-1,Cute in theory  i love the bright colors  the tied black collar sash and the 70's vibe  however  the fabric is cheap  and the worst part in my view is that the seams that run along the front center of the shirt do not align the pattern. maybe this was intentional  but with the shirt i received  it looked horrible. i sent it back. i notice in the picture that the black ties are strategically placed over the center front seam  so it is a bit deceiving. i wouldn't buy this top at any price based on
-1,Runs big and looked unflattering. i am petite  might work on someone taller.
-1,I ordered this dress  expecting a cool lightweight summer dress. i believe it says cotton in the description.however the material is a very heavy cotton-linen blend.would have much preferred a better quality fabric.the color is a nice green and is well made.it runs large  except in the bust which fit well.
-1,I was thoroughly underwhelmed. it did not hang well  and the fit seemed off. the tie waist just sort of hung there. i could have sized down  but i didn't even want to bother. it was pretty boring and flimsy for $138.
1,I liked this coat but my family said it looked too much like something hilary clinton would wear. i am 54 and i think it made me look a bit dowdy since it runs a bit big.
0,I didn't really notice the collar when i ordered it on line and i'm not really liking it. it's the rough  unstitched thing they like to do sometimes and it just makes it look slightly more casual and well  rough around the edges. it's a nicely cut  great fitting sweater though so i'll be looking for some scarves!
0,I am a large in knit tees. this is the first tee where the large was just too big. it kind of hung on me. the band across the back also hung down so all over it looked like it was just too big a size for me. the army green turned out to be not a flattering shade of green for me so i returned it. i liked the whole design a lot  especially the front macrame part  but for me it did not work at all. also  too expensive for a tee.
0,"I decided to take advantage of the free shipping despite seeing no reviews yet. i received the dress today and it is exactly as pictured  only about 3 inches shorter. i am usually between an xs and s but chose the xs because of late  everything i seem to order is huge. this was an exception and i could have ordered the s. color was as pictured  a nice green. fabric was a gauzy cotton. the dress was just ""alright"". nothing special to warrant the price tag. it felt like a little girl's dress on me"
0,I wanted to love this dress. the colors are heavenly and it looks light and airy. it isn't  it is very heavy  much too heavy for florida heat. the top layer is a beautiful sand color and while the fabric is nice  the heaviness of the top really weighs the whole dress down. i felt like it added ten pounds to my appearance  easily. back it went  boo hoo. if you are between sizes  i would size down  runs a bit big.
-1,I was really excited to get this top in the mail; unlike other reviewers  i didn't find that the top fit small  but i thought that the tight fit across the shoulders and chest didn't look good with the billow-y torso of the top. i think this top would be flattering on really thin girls  but i'm very tall and broad shouldered  so it didn't look as good on me.
1,Yes! yes! yes!   i buy a lot of dresses from retailer  and about once a year i hit the jackpot with a dress that hits all the marks! this dress is it!    i bought the white linen version on a whim. i never buy white dress because  1. i don't want to look bigger than my pear shape already is  and 2. i like red wine and i that's risky in a white dress!     i don't know how this designer did it  but this dress is amazing! it's slimming and flattering and summery and current. and i am two sizes bigger
1,"This top is ""comfort wear"" or something i would wear to feel comfortable and cozy on the weekends but not something i would wear to work. because of that it is not an item i would traditionally purchase at retailer. that said  it is one of the best comfort clothing pieces i have found in a long time and i fell in love with it. i like the color which is good for transitioning into spring time  it is a thicker material which is great for transitional weather but also makes me more comfortable"
0,"I ordered this in a medium and although the details/design of the shirt were cute  the ""swing"" did not work for me this time around. i typically like looser fitting tops  but with this shirt i felt like there was just too much material and made me feel like i was wearing a tent."
0,The positive: light-weight fabric  interesting drape  the negative: i'm tall and would have preferred if it was longer. the big drawback is the ridiculous buttons--three fell off the first time i wore it...and it fits loosely! they're held on by a single loop...ugh.
1,Comfortable and soft are two of my favorite words when it comes to clothes. this shirt meets both requirement. it is a great length and can be casual and dressed up. must have for fall and winter.
1,I love this sweater! it's extremely cozy and great for wearing with leggings due to the length. i ordered the red color in a s and it fits great and it is long  like i had hoped. the red is really more of a burnt orange than the red in the photo  but i actually like that even better.
1,I feel really cool wearing this skirt :-) a nice alternative to the jeans that are my standard uniform. loooks great with short boots. i'm wearing it as i write this review--and was wearing it all day. awesome skirt!
1,These are probably my 10th pair of pilcro legging jeans  and though i love the color  sort of a worn in  soft black/ dark gray  these particular pair fit a tiny bit more snug than any of my others. it could be the fact that these are ankle length vs most others are long with the cords being extra long and cozy. so i wonder if the fact that these are shorter they tend to sit on my legs a little differently. it may also be just this pair was cut a tiny bit smaller. i am toying with the idea of ask
1,Flattering  comfortable  and a fantastically versatile color and style. if you'd like the garment to fit about how it does on the model  i'd say that it's tts. the picture represents the color accurately - is a very dark  slate grey. i've found that the color is a great neutral - i can wear it with other neutrals or with colors  as featured on the model. the style is also really versatile - i can wear it as a stand-alone t-shirt  or under a blazer to work.    i've washed the garment once on the
1,Love this dress!!! i agree with the other reviewers  i had to size up one size  but then it was perfect. i'm 5'5  125 lbs. and the size 6 worked great.
0,"I desperately wanted this to work - it's a beautiful color and overall quality...it is just so short and wide (almost a perfect square if you lay it out flat). i can see it looking better on someone on the shorter side  but on my 5'7"" frame and long torso it just didn't look right. few extra inches and this could have been awesome!"
1,So soft. a casual tunic  yet polished and interesting enough for work. darker blue than the photo  and the colors are much brighter and prettier in person.
1,"I'm 5'3"" and 110 lbs. i usually have a hard time finding pants or leggings that are short enough and fit just right. i ordered an xs  and these fit like a glove right away and i was so pleased! i ordered the brown and blue motif. i have only received the blue so far but love them. they hit just right at the ankle and aren't too loose at the bottom. it seems like they are made well but will wait until after the first wash. i'm someone that wears leggings all the time but love that these look like"
1,"I ordered these in the pinkish color  and i love them! i'm 5'8"" 140 lbs. and the size small fits perfectly. they are definitely sheer  but they're advertised as a cover-up so that was expected. these will be super cute paired with a bathing suit top - bikini  bandeau  or even tankini. the price is great  especially for the type of pant and detailing with the pom poms. no pockets is the only negative."
-1,The skirt is totally see through unless you wear a slip. even though it has a built in slip  it is still see through. the problem is that the slip is made out of the same super thin polyester material as the outside skirt. if it wasn't see through i would keep it.
-1,"These have a very interesting cut. it seems like they were made for someone extremely tall. i'm about 5'5"" and the size 4 fit in the waist  but fell way below where they do on the model on the picture. it's hard to imagine who they would look good on  they're also very poofy right below the waist."
0,This dress did not work for me. it was shapeless and boxy. i tried to belt it but the white front looked odd. if you are tall and thin maybe but not for the short girls.
-1,There were no reviews when i purchased this dress. from the picture with the model  the dress looks to be a straight shift dress. i received mine yesterday and the dress flairs out and isn't straight. it is also pretty large. i ordered a medium as the smalls were sold out and i'm not sure i will keep it. still on the fence. dress is shorter than pictured as well. sleeves are shorter than shown. now  after having seen the dress and looking at the online picture  i think the model is holding her a
-1,This dress makes me so sad...the textured stretchy fabric  color  length  and overall swingy fit are spot on. as another reviewer noted though  the armholes and neck totally ruin the dress. the neck is tiny  which i could have gotten over once it was on  but the arm holes were just awful - too big all around (too tall of a cut plus too wide of a cut). basically  you could see my bra plus from the front there was unflattering exposure near the armholes. it could have been so good  but alas  but t
1,This is one of those 'i need one in every color' kind of shirts. need - not simply want. it is very well constructed. the fabric is the perfect weight and is sooooooo comfortable. the raspberry is a little more dusty rose than pictured online  but it works. i've only had the shirt a couple of day. in addition to wanting to wear it every day  the fabric has not pilled. i'm short-waisted  and i have not had any issue with the high-low hem or cropped length.
0,It was cute. i didn't keep it because it wasn't soft and hung a bit different than pictured. i thought it would be softer material. it was itchy
-1,"I'm a rather small person--5'2""  about 100 lbs  32a bust. i typically take a 24p/00p/xxs. knowing how retailer's sizing is a bit all over the place  i ordered this tee in both xxs and xs  planning to return the size that was less preferred. imagine my surprise when i try on one of the tees and i barely can get it on; imagine my further surprise when i realize that the xs is the tee that was so clingy. now i realize that this is supposed to be a body-skimming tee  but even as petite as i am  i coul"
-1,I found this as a return in the store. i tried the xxs. i was so excited because it looked really cute on the hanger. it was so huge- looked like i was wearing an xl.
-1,This is the 2nd time i've purchased a dolan top and returned it b/c it was dry clean only. both tops were what i consider to be casual tops to be worn with a pair of jeans  running errands  etc. i do not dry clean this kind of casual shirt. it is made out of rayon  and that's the problem i think.  i purchased this in the wine color and it is a lovely color  hangs nicely  doesn't cling. the sleeves are a bit long but i could live with that -- i just pushed them up. as a turtleneck  it was a bit l
0,I have been looking for a quality pair of black skinny jeans for a while. after reading the reviews  i had such high hopes for these jeans. i bought it in my usual size 28 and while the top part fit perfectly  i found that the bottom was too tapered in and ultra skinny making it not look right. sadly  i had to return.

0,Was so excited for this top! loved the embroidered detail and the teal green color. i got it in a medium and it was swimming on me. it also had a maternity type feel since there is a lot more material (making it look blousy) than showing on the model (they must have pinned it back in the stock photo).  sadly  it's going back.
-1,I ordered a small  which is my usual retailer size  but this was like a tent on me. it's fine if you like things super super blousey but that wasn't what i was looking for. also it is very long  a very weird amount of long. also there is only eyelet on the front. the whole back of the shirt is just plain fabric. i like the idea of this shirt but all in all it was very disappointing.
0,Loved the look  quality was great  but didn't work for me. too busy and off-fitting. i did return.
0,Nice fabric  very versatile but the knit top and style accentuates your bust. probably not an issue for most but if your a d or up it's more attention than you may want.
1,I loved the contrast of the front panels and sleeves/back of this sweater. it has a coat look with the ease of a sweater. the arms seem very long and i wish i went with an xs as where i live not much laying is needed. but overall this is a lovely sweater!
1,"Absolutely love this little shift!!! i bought it on a whim really. it just harkened back to my crushed velvet loving days of the 80's! crushed velvet then was just something fuzzy that had been run over by a car and maybe thrown up on a few times at a punk rock bar :-) this is not that sort of velvet. it's also not some cheap polyester looking knock-off of true velvet. i always find those to have a somewhat ""plastic"" sheen to them. that is exactly what i was worried about judging from the pictur"
1,I wasn't sure what to expect when i ordered this but when it arrived i was pleasantly surprised that it's by postmark and has an interesting cut. i ordered the xl in the hope that it would be oversized and slouchy. it is that and more! the lightweight  sweater like material is truly perfect for the transition to spring. i look forward to wearing it tomorrow!
0,This top was really cute on someone else  but not on me... on me  ti was too big and the color washed me out. the fabric is nice and the pattern and colors are nice too  just not on porcelain skin... like many tops this season  it is a bit boxy  but looks nice with jeans  white shorts or half-tucked into a skirt. i would probably size down a bot...
-1,This dress fit so oddly. i tried on two different sizes and both did this super unflattering poochy thing at the belly. the dress wasn't tight at my hips in either size  it was just that there was weird extra fabri right around the midsection that stuck out. maybe i was too short? couldn't figure it out.     the color and detailing are beautiful though! a little tight in the bust.
-1,I love the teal color of this t-shirt and the macrame design at the top is beautiful  however  the top is way too large.  i usually wear a size xs or s in retailer tops  so i ordered the size s  there is so much fabric below the chest it fits like a maternity top.  i know if i order an xs  i will have the same problem.  below the bust  the top is not flattering and it&amp;#39;s a shame.
-1,I really wanted to love these because i love my other steps  but they did not feel or fit the same way at all. i was also disappointed to see that they are cream and not white. these jeans feel stiffer than other stets i own and the waist was huge on me. sadly  these will be going back.
-1,"Do not buy this dress for full price. the design looks great but after receiving the dress  the material is made of extremely cheap slinky-ish polyester that you would find at a f21 store. the stitching is horrific and created an uneven ""hump"" on the back seam. just absolutely poor poor quality."
-1,I thought these were gorgeous and was going to buy them although the price was a bit high. in fact  two separate women came up to me as i was walking around the store and asked where i got the pants because the colors are so vivid. however  as we were looking at the items  we noticed that both the green and the blue both had several small holes in them due to stitching quality  as the previous reviewer noted. therefore  none of us purchased the pants.    the staff at the store were very helpful
-1,I'm baffled why none of the other reviewers have mentioned how large these pants are. i ordered the petite small  and i'm always a small. these are huge. i felt like i had on a large. i like the thin material and color  and i'm sad that they are so large.
0,"I was obsessed with this dress from the moment i saw it online and was so excited to buy it for my company christmas party. i'm 5'4""  36c  145lbs and i ordered a 6. the size was great but the whole cut of the dress was completely off for me. i have a fairly short torso but the top portion of the dress (which is a sweater-like material) hit me far too low on my waist to be flattering; the petite may have fixed it  but then the skirt would've been too short. the pleats were cute but flared out too"
1,What a great shirt. however  none of the ones i saw in store are colored like the picture. the front of them are all a deep blue color  no tie-dyed effect or whatever you're seeing on the online pics. the shirt runs large. i am an 8/10 38c and the smaller size was plenty big. i can't imagine how the larger size would have looked! i think this top will go with many things  including as a cover up over dresses.
-1,"I was so excited to purchase this dress; i love all shades of grey for winter clothing  i love knits  and i have loved other maeve dresses. however  i simply cannot fathom how poorly this is designed--it fits absolutely nothing like it appears to on the model  to the point that i wonder if i might have received a defective dress.  for reference  i am 5'5""  slender and small-boned but also curvy (hourglass). my bust is 36 c  hips about 37-38. i normally wear a small in maeve dresses. maybe it's j"
1,Sunday in brooklyn has been killing it lately with their tops! i could not decide between this and another of theirs  but i am glad i chose this one. first  the design is great. very cunning style: the sleeve length matches the length of the top tier  which gives this top a very finished look. the color is a beautiful jewel-like raspberry red with a bluish undertone. and  the fabric is a nice washable poly. i wore my usual size xs at retailer.
-1,Loved the design but jacket looked like 20 years old because of a lot of piling even brand new jacket at store. i wish they use better quality fabric so i would have purchased it.
1,I was a bit unsure when ordering because of the cut of this blouse. i have a lean athletic torso but i am a 32dd. sometimes tops like this can make me look heavy or pregnant. love the fit though. it fits lovely and comfy. it goes well with jeans or cream colored pants and will be a nice addition to my spring wardrobe.
1,These leggings are so warm and comfortable. they're thick enough to wear as pants  and they don't stretch and slide during the day. i wish they came in more colors!
-1,Very cute dress  but fabric is very flimsy and seams were very puckered which couldn't be pressed out.
0,The fabric is very thin. it isn't see through  just thin. i would have kept this if the full length shell wasn't longer than the dress.
-1,Loved the color and the deshn. but when i put on  did not look right. waist was too short and the arms were long.
0,I love this shirt  in fact  i love all bordeaux tops from retailer. i followed the instructions to hand wash only and after it was wet and then lay flat to dry  it may fit a child. it is a belly top. i want to love this  but it shrunk so bad even with the hand wash only instructions.
-1,These are a beautiful color  but run large. i ordered my usual size and they are falling off of me. they are very low rise so i don't think i'll be trying the smaller size  can't even imagine them being lower. also  they are cropped  that's hard to tell in the picture.
-1,This is another item i've been stalking that i thought miraculously made it to sale with my size still available. i ordered online but when it arrived i have to be honest i didn't even try it on because i knew it would be going back. the beautiful print online looks really cheap irl on the flimsy fabric. the beaded detail on neck is basically a low grade sequin trim. so much potential just executed poorly.
-1,I waited for this dress to go on sale and when it did i bought it right away. i am disappointed!!! the lace fabric is very stiff. i should have listened to the previous reviewer. i feel like it is poking out on my arms and neck. although i appreciate the careful placements of flowers on the dress  had the fabric been different  i think it would be a great dress.
0,I liked the quality of the top and the design. but when i got a top that fit well across the chest  it was shorter than i usually like my tops  so i will be returning it.
1,I originally purchased a small after reading some of the reviews. although it did fit  i felt it was just slightly snug across the chest and upper arms. i returned for a medium (my usual size) and it was perfect. it had the same look and flow as what you see in the model pics. i love love love that it is long-sleeved and has pockets!!!!! i went ahead and ordered the other print as well! i wore the first one to work with some knee high boots and got many compliments. highly recommend!
1,I bought 2 of these in peach and maize. the fabric is yummy and soft as silk  the eyelet detail gorgeous and the colors are great  however there is too much fabric! if only a bit less  the fabulous swing shape would work. that said  i'm keeping mine if just for the gorgeous fabric and colors. i would even consider buying the third color just to wear around the house  if sale was on sale again.
1,I am simply mad about this dress. i am smaller on top with larger hips. my bust is a mellow b but i could see this working on a or c cups also. this dress is extremely flattering for my body type and the bodice fits like it was made for me. it fits fine without a bra and just perfectly with a semi padded strapless. i got this dress to wear to a summer wedding. the texture and color are beautiful and i will pair with simple jewelry and nude heels. it's a great find and excellent quality. definite
0,The pattern is very cute!  from the front i liked it  but when i turn to the side  you can see just how voluminous it is.  it ended up looking a bit tenty.  if it had just a bit more shape it would be perfect.  in the end  not the most flattering.
-1,These pants are gorgeous when you first see them. they fit beautifully when you first put them on. and then you wear them for one day. and they snag. on everything. and little strings start to come out of the pants. and the hem begins to unravel. and the pants which were once beautiful light summer pants appropriate for work or brunch are now frumpy  worn out pants with a million snags and strings hanging off of them .... after one day.     i can't begin to tell you how annoyed i am that i spent
0,Love the style  weight (not too hot) and look but it sheds all over any pants other than jeans. i also wore a white tank under it and it stained it blue. very disappointed
1,"I usually have to order a size up in ranna gill dresses because of tight bodices. i did this time and it's too big  so i would stay tts or size down depending on your bust size. color is more moss/olive (green with a gray undertone) than shown online. no liner and the fabric is a smooth polyester that feels more summer weight than autumn. gorgeous embroidery on the chest. teeny tiny neck button closure and fussy side zip. i am 5'3"" and purchased petite but it is still too long unless i wear my f"
0,This dress is beautiful  it just swallowed my small frame whole! the colors and design are gorgeous  just not a good fit for me  even at a 0p.
-1,I was hoping these would be like some of the lace shorts i bought from retailer last year that i loved so much. sadly  no. first of all they run small. i am between a s and xs in most brands  bought a s in these because i like my shorts on the looser side. these felt a little snug and short  but i decided to keep them. the first time i washed them  they were ruined. i followed the directions exactly and even put them in a lingerie bag in the washer  plus a delicate cycle  no dryer. the lace is man
1,This sweater is lovely! i have worn it every other day since i got it. it is soft and warm and elevates everything that you wear it with. i have gotten compliments every time i've worn it. my daughter  who rarely likes the style of clothes i wear  said i looked like a winter princess in this! it is so flattering and comfortable---a winning combination!
0,The shirt is beautifully made and very comfortable. i'm a medium though  and i ordered as such- but it's way too big for me.
0,"The style of this dress is quite lovely  i immediately gravitated towards it when i saw in the store  however once i tried it on it looked like a sack of potatoes...unfortunately the loose silhouette did not do anything for my figure  i should mention that i am 5'9"" and have an athletic figure but with hips.   the design is very on trend and the dress does have some lovely details like the lace around the hip area and flowy fabric. but unfortunately it was not enough for me to purchase. also the"
1,This dress is light  airy easy and comfortable to wear. i love the colors and pattern. it looks wonderful with or without a belt. i sized down from a 6 to a 4. i position the front of the dress material closer to the neck so it flows longer at the back. although i am a size 6 the under slip fits perfectly in a size 4. i prefer the dress without a belt but it also looks good with a belt or a jacket or long cardigan.   this dress is a keeper!
1,I love this dress! it is so much fun to wear to the beach or out to lunch! the arm holes are a little large so i wear s tank underneath!
0,I have the blue and gray and love the look and feel. however  the gray within days ripped at the seam and other areas.
0,"The dress at first glance is pretty  feminine  and a timeless shape. sadly the quality just isn't there.  i ordered online and was excited trying it on (dress fit true to size for me  all be it a little snug in the chest).  the zipper is super cheap  hard to get up or down on or off the hanger.  the appliquã©s are sewn onto a super flimsy netting  already coming detached without even having worn it.  i could see this dress catching on ""everything"" and tearing easily.  given the quality i'm return"
1,I thought this sweater was pretty and soft and would be comfortable to wear. i really liked the high collar and the interesting poncho-like design. but the sleeves were a bit short on me. and i thought it was a little pricy. i decided against it for those reasons. but if you don't mind those things  then you might like it. it's definitely worth the try.
1,"I love this sweater! i ordered the xs petite. it fits perfectly! it is soft. i hate itchy sweaters. the ""peach"" color is actually more pink  but i love the color. great buy! i'm ordering another one."
0,I was so excited to finally find a work appropriate contemporary pant that i wore them about 3 times in the first week. needless to say they needed to be washed  and i followed the care instructions by washing in cold water and laying flat to dry. after just a single wash in cold water  the pants faded to the point that they looked like they were three years old. so sad  luckily retailer took them back without a problem. be warned  these may need to be dry cleaned which is a lot of maintena
1,I wanted this top to work so bad. unfortunately the way the bust of the top is designed it isn't flattering if you aren't flat chested. it squishes on side of your chest and leaves the other side alone. i'm a b cup and had this problem so if you are a b or larger  i don't recommend. however  if you are smaller busted  this piece would be worth the purchase.
-1,I bought this very cute t-shirt in sky. wore it once  then washed it according to the washing instuctions (machine washable/dryable). this t-shirt turned into a crop top!!!!! i can't wear it. it's going to goodwill. i would suggest that you air dry this shirt  if you want to take the chance that it won't shrink up several inches.
1,I'm glad i checked out the reviews before purchasing - i went a size smaller and the sweater fit perfectly! i love the taupe color - it's feminine (not overtly so) and i can still use it as a neutral. the quality is really quite good  though i would still suggest keeping metal accessories (without smooth edges) away from the fabric. it's also not too heavy so i can still wear this despite the heat and humidity in honolulu.     i think the only thing i would consider changing would be the materia
-1,I really wanted to love this dress. it is absolutely beautiful - the color  design and details. however  whether it is the high neckline or the sleeves  it did nothing for me and made me look kinda frumpy. though i am slender  i have a chest. maybe that was the problem.
-1,Beautiful in pictures and i loved it before i tried it on. as the other reviews state  it is short and wide. i like the top so much  i am going to try to add some gathering across the back to offer some shape. otherwise it is an unflattering shapeless box :(
0,I love the rich deep color and the style but once again this brand runs really small in the waist. i am normally a 8/10 in retailer skirts and the size 10 was tight at the waist enough so i could not button it and feel comfortable. the quality is ok  something i feel i would see at another type of discount store. for me this skirt did not work but the color and softness of the fabric was a plus.
-1,"I might be the only odd person out there who think this jacket is not perfect at all. a lot of other reviewers said that the jacket runs small. for me  it's not true at all  i had to go to xxp petite to find the fit acceptable  but it was simply too short (rather than 20"" as it states on the website  it's more like 18"")  which is a thing i almost never experienced because i am a petite person! i don't even want to go regular size because it would've been too big. i saw some photos that others po"
1,This color is gorgeous. this could be dressed up or down. great buy!
0,I am torn about this dress. the print is very pretty and the fabric has a gentle flow to it. the top part is great but the portion below the chest reminded me of a tent. it is tricky to pull off if you are well-endowed on the top or wear a padded bra. i liked the look better when i tied it at the back with the ultra-thin belt straps which gave some shape to the waist. i agree with the other reviewer that a slim person could carry the look well. i usually don't return online purchases unless they
0,Was excited about this sweater but it really didn't wow me when i put it on. the v-neck is quite low and the sweater is a bit short. loved the ideas of the fringe but in the end  it went back.
1,I purchased the grey jacket first and it seems to work with a lot of things and create different looks. so i purchased the tan jacket. i found it to less tan as an olive color. not my favorite color for me. but the fit is awesome and hopefully the color will prove to be versatile too. the blouse shown with it does not go with it as i had hoped. the jacket seems very green with the golden brown in the blouse. so a black or ivory blouse with some great necklace should work. recommend. pretty true
1,"These are very cute and i bought both colors. they are accurately pictured. however  right out of the bag they had an especially strong chemical-type odor. must be the dye. i have been airing them outside in the sun trying to decide if i will keep them. they seem to be ""calming down"" a bit but it's been two days!! they are not jersey but are a non-stretchy type fabric with a slight sheen. dress up or down. i'm a 00 or 24 and the xs fit well."
1,"I ordered the petite size 27 and the fit is just like on the model...not tight at all and very flattering. even the petite length is long on me and i will need to wear wedges or something with a heel but honestly that makes them even more flattering...makes my legs look long! i am 5'4"" and about 118#. the material is so soft and substantial...the color is very accurately portrayed online. i can't wait to wear this fall!"
1,"This vest is super cute! i'm 5'5"" 120 and usually wear an xs at retailer  i have this in a small and it fits perfectly  fits snug when zipped  my usual xs would have definitely been too tight. would definitely recommend!"
0,This cardigan is very cute. but after 1 wash and no dryer the back has a bunch of pulled threads! very bummed with the quality.
1,I was on the fence about this top  because i don't typically do longer tunic styles. however  it really is quite lovely. i paired it with long jeans  wedge sandals  and a delicate necklace - so pretty! it fits very nicely and i was surprised at how much i liked the length.
-1,I saw this sweater on-line and loved it until i tried it on. i'm 5-7  flat chested  135 pounds and i ordered a size small. the sweater fit everywhere except for my arms. this sweater will work great if you are short. consider making your sweaters a little longer  because i do not consider myself tall.
0,Comfortable and soft material  cute design and nice longer length..however  i'm long waisted and this looked ridiculous on my me  elastic came up right under my bra and not at my waist. would be cute for someone shorter.
0,I was so excited about this top  super cute and fit perfectly but as soon as i washed it (cold  hand wash  air dry) it shrunk! now it is too short and tight. i did not expect the material to shrink so very disappointed.
-1,This shirt was tent like on me and there was really no way around it. i am fairly small- usually a 4 or 6 in tops  and smaller on top- barely 34b. this top was incredibly unflattering  falling to cut right at my hips and sitting open and way too flowy-- like a pillowcase/sacklike fit. there was just too much fabric here to make it work for me. it's unfortunate because it looks adorable in the product photo and i love the plaid mix with the open shoulders- a nice transition to fall. unfortunately
0,"This piece is stunning. you can dress up or down with it. my husband said ""wow that's very elegant"". it is very soft. thin but warm. however  it came to me with numerous holes along one strip of fabric. i returned it for another. it is a very delicate fabric. the zig zag stitching may snag easily.  i'm afraid it will not wash well. definitely a hand wash item. i'm not sure i will keep it in the end. the design i thought should be a 5 star because of the look and versitality of the item. quality"
-1,"And the bottom looks like a tutu. first  i have high tolerance for scratchy fabric but this one i could feel it even through long sleeves. there is no way i could wear something that makes my skin itch so badly. second  the peplum part is huge and looks like an exaggerated skirt. finally  the color on the ""green one"" is darker than in the picture and it does have more of a green than blue tint. back it goes."
-1,"I tried a size x small on in the store and i am 5'4"" 120 lbs. i had trouble getting my head through the dress  and once i did it felt so tight at the neck  as if it was chocking me. the dress color is very nice but the tight neck and odd arm holes were a no. i would not recommend this dress for those reasons."

0,Pretty tee  but not worth the price.  lace is beautiful  but fit is blah.
1,I got this planning to wear to a wedding  but have dressed it up for a gala event and down with a white sleeveless top to an awards ceremony. i've definitely gotten some mileage out of it! like the other reviews said  it is long  but was able to easily trim excess fabric from the bottom and it works perfect with wedges. love it!
1,So many retailer coats have gotten away from me. sold out before i could purchase. i bought this during the holidays when it went on sale. i did not want this the be the one that got away. so glad i did. the colors are beautiful  the sweater is really a coat. so it justifies the price. what a gorgeous piece to wear with all of my retailer clothes. length of arms was fine on me. i bought a large. i am 5 foot six.
-1,This is a very soft and comfortable jacket but it has holes in the pocket area. it was returned to the store and the other jackets had the same problem although not in the same area. the store was considering pulling the product off their shelves. it is unclear if the holes are just the beginning of a pocket or what. but it was flawed by everyone who looked at it.
-1,Ugh  i was so disappointed with this shirt. i was so excited when i saw it online and thought it would be a perfect summer shirt with the light colors and the flower print. unfortunately it falls flat and i understand now why they don't have a straight on photo of the shirt  its very plain and lays very unflatteringly. it's definitely missing something in the front. i typically wear a small to an extra small and i ordered this in an extra small and would have needed an xxs if i hadn't returned i
0,Very cute top and nice material  but the fit is strange. there's a reason that the model has her arms at her side. the shoulders fit perfectly in my usual small  but the body is very loose. the sleeves are full  probably twice as full as seen in the pictures which adds interest but was unexpected. also  the arm hole is wide  so the bottom seam of the sleeve attaches low on the body of the shirt  which creates an awkward silhouette. i normally love designs by whit  but i'm not sure about this one
0,These pants are really beautiful. the material feels nice and i love the pull on style  however  they are much too long for me. i'm 5'3 and they literally hang to my ankles which is not at all flattering like the photos. i think if you are tall enough  these are a wonderful piece.
-1,"I couldn't wait to get this dress! i bought it and was instantly disappointed when i took it out of the bag. while the fabric was beautiful  the sizing was way off. this dress claims to be 35"" long  and i could tell instantly it wasn't. it barely covered my rear. i also know it's supposed to be flowy  but it was really  really wide. i can see this working for someone around 5 feet tall who is wider."
1,This is a beautifu;l dress. unfortunately it runs extremely large. i wear sized 10-12 and ordered l. i was lost in all the material. but because i love this dress so much  i am taking a chance and ordered it in small.
-1,Weird fit and the tie just add to the problems. i think i'd like this a lot more if it were just an open cardigan without the tie. the tie seems like an after thought. it's flimsy and it just makes anyone wearing this look like a house -- no matter there size. i ordered a medium black and it's already in the mail!
0,The color on these are amazing. i am 5'2 and these are really meant for that long lean profile. note they have very little stretch.
1,I bought the white version of this beautiful top in the store yesterday  this romantic top is beautifully detailed  very soft  comfortable and flattering. there is a thin cotton liner underneath too. fits true to size with enough room in the bust to not be too tight.
-1,I was so excited to try these on at my local retailer. i'm so glad i did before i ordered them online because i found the fit to be totally off. the pants bulged around my hips and looked very awkward. they were also not as soft as i expected them to be.
-1,My usual size was a bit large and baggy in most areas but the bust was sooo soo small. the button popped and i had barely moved. do not recommend this one for anyone with a bust. the detailing is very pretty though for someone that can make this work.
0,This dress is beautiful but the bottom half was too tight for my shape.
1,I was looking for a white shirt to layer with this winter. this shirt looks great on its own  but it has also done great as a long sleeved layer under vests  etc. it's a little thin so i only gave it 4 stars for quality  but it is holding up well so far.
1,Love this top! not too low cut  drapes nicely and the material is thin enough but not so thin you have to wear a tank top. it does seem to run on the larger side.
0,"I wanted to love this. i have been looking for a poncho-type sweater for our cold midwestern winters. the cream colored one that i really wanted sold out instantly and i missed the window for the xxsp. i ordered this in the xs/sp (smallest size available). i am 5'1"" and 108 lbs with small shoulders. the neck opening is huge. my collar bones and a seciton of my upper back were exposed. this would not keep me warm due to so much exposed skin on my neck  back  and shoulders. i suppose i could get a"
1,Absolutely amazing! a must staple in every one's closet this season. i purchased the dress in a medium for a more relaxed look/feel. the silhouette is comfortable and makes for the perfect put on
0,"The material was a little itchy in my opinion. the fit was pretty big. almost a night shirt. i'm 5' 3""  and i will probably only wear this around the house with tights. i got a small. i purchased the orange color online. stay away if you have an olive skin tone! it's the pinkish it appears to be on be on the website. i'm 130 pounds 34d"
0,These shorts are just beautiful. with that said  they were expensive  but made reasonable when i snagged them in the online sale! they do also run large  and they seem to be made for short-waisted bodies. i will be bringing them back to my local store to (hopefully) exchange for a smaller size. fingers crossed that they still have them in stock!
1,Gorgeous dress but fits really large. ordered a petite large. going to send it back and try the petite medium. wish it was available at my store to try on and not have to wait for it to be reshipped.
0,"The color of this is beautiful. i'm 5'8"" and had to order the s because they were out of the m  so it's not as dramatically long on me as on the model  but otherwise fit - sleeves a little shorter too. the m would have been better. but it is a little scratchy wherever it touches my skin  so it's not worth the $$$ to me. going back :("
1,This is a really pretty top. the beading/rivet detail is really cool and it feels comfortable on. i think the lining is really silky and the lace feels gentle  not stiff. the top is kind of like a swing top  there is a lot of fabric  but it is just right. the fabric looks rich and lovely. great top!
1,I wasn't sure how the knotted front would look on me  but it lays perfectly. very comfortable  well-designed  flattering top in lovely rich colors. i'm normally a small-medium in retailer tops  but i got the large as it does run small and i don't like things too clingy. so best to try on in store rather than buy online. nice simple statement piece!
-1,Very sheer inexpensive material. even on sale i'm returning it
1,This is a really cute skirt  and it seems well-made (good stitch-work and enough weight to the fabric that i'm not worried about underwear show-through but not too heavy for a summer skirt). i sized up from an 8 to a 10 because it was difficult to get the skirt over my bum. also  the zipper doesn't lay flat when i have it in the back of the skirt so i just shifted it to the side--still looks great imo. i think if you have hips or a booty you might want to size up on this skirt. color is true to
1,This dress is very pretty and would be nice for a summer wedding. you will need to go braless or wear a strapless bra. i am sending it back because as it runs very small. i am a 34a and the size 2 was too snug across the top.
-1,"The picture makes the pants appear flattering and comfortable. but they are not flattering at all. they seemed much bigger than they should have been and the ""fold over"" portion was not necessary."
1,I love seafolly boyleg bathing suits. i find them very flattering and just universally appealing. this one has beautiful summery design as well. i found it to be running slightly smaller than plain colored editions of this suit. i normally wear size 6 (us size) of this suit  but this particular design 6 was too small and had to exchange for 8(us) which fits perfect.
-1,"I am 5' 7"" - 110 lbs. ordered my normal xs and the bottom portion was way over sized. it fit like a parachute  you could fit about 12 of me in the bottoms and very short. nice quality material  but extremely awkward fit."
0,I was so in love with these when i saw them online. they arrived today  and while the fit was great  i was disappointed. the colors are definitely more drab in person than what's pictured in the photo. the material is very thick. it's soft and they'd be warm in cold weather  i'm sure. i liked them  but they were underwhelming. if they were less expensive  i would probably keep them because i liked the fit and they'd be a quirky alternative to what i usually wear to work  but sadly  back they go.
1,I ordered this for the colors  and modern geometric design. colors are as shown. a beautiful combination that works well with blue jeans  and my burgundy flats. it's casual and soft enough to wear all day. i wore it to the beach  then out to dinner the same evening! oh... i spilled red wine on it at the beach  and couldn't wash it until the next day. i used dawn dish detergent and hydrogen peroxide on the spots  then laundered in the washer on hot and they came out  completely. i air dried  and
-1,I really wanted to like this top  but unfortunately it is not as pretty or flattering in person. the yellow looks dirty in real life  not pretty like the picture. it is also a strange fit/shape when it is on. i tried it on in the store and did not like it at all.
0,This sweater is huge! i usually wear a small  ordered an extra small and i was still swimming in it. i like big sweaters  but i ended up returning it because the sizing looked ridiculous.
0,I was excited to nab this lovely because i am a sucker for a faux layered look. i am usually an xs or s  depending on the designer so i went with xs in this top based on reviews that it doesn't drape well. i barely got my arms into the sleeves. i thought maybe it was a mistake and i received a child's size?  i eventually did get it on but barely got it back off. size up 1-2 for comfort if you have to have this girl. i was bummed my local retailer did not have a m for me to try. returned.  for ref:
-1,I really liked the design. ordered a medium which was huge. also thought i would not be able to tolerate it because of the material -- a bit itchy. returned it.
-1,Got this in purple and love it! ordered red and silver and only received red so far  but had to return because it was oddly shaped and didn't fit well like the purple. not sure what happens. maybe miss sized?
1,Love love this dress. fits so great. i normally wouldn't have picked this dress. more preppy than my normal style. fits amazing. my hubby has complimented me more on this dress than anything else i've ever owned. the fit & flare style is super flattering i felt it fit tts.
1,So glad i was able to snag these killer 70's-ish flares. they are super cool at a nice length. love the button detail. i ordered these in my current size and they fit right out of the box. love them so much.
-1,This top is beautiful online and in person. i am in no way a large full figured gal  but i did order an xl. reading the past review and wanting an airy fit i ordered a larger size. this shirt is horribly tiny in person! the xl regular fit looked like an xs. have no idea if this particular shirt sent to me was miss sized or what. will take back. other than fit  the shirt is very beautiful in every way.
1,Loved my. mustard colored ones so much  i also bought the ligher green color. fit is wonderful- and very flattering. they can be dressed up or down. they look great with heals or booties!
1,"This skirt is not only cute but really comfy. i really like the materials it's made of and the way it seems to hug my body in a flattering way. i'm 5'2"" so the only down side is that i wish it came in petite but i still kept it because it looked great hitting me right above my knees and high at my waist. love this skirt!"
0,"This is a busy dress that makes me think ""boho-glam holly hobby"". i bought my usual size and it looks like nightmare of a nightgown on me. i'm going to try a size smaller in the hopes i will love it more. i'm recommending this dress for those that like the quirky whimsical hippie eclectic crafty style."
-1,Mine came smelling like gasoline. not sure why  but i would have kept it otherwise. it's a smell that will be really hard to get out. looks like the picture.
-1,The back of this t-shirt looks cute but the front looks really weird. the material in the back is quite stiff but the grey material is soft  so the front gray area ends up hanging weirdly and looking uneven and messy. i appreciate asymmetrical clothing but to me it looked like a patched up rag from the front. it fits true to size.
-1,I ordered this to wear for a holiday party hoping to have something unique and dressy. it was too bulky at the shoulders and looked like something a football player would wear. the little ruffled flower pieces were random at the top and stuck out in all the wrong directions. it wasn't as elegant as the model pic (is it ever?) and for this price should fit like a glove. went back within seconds. also  it's pretty short  and bulky short isn't flattering on too many people.
-1,Do not buy! i used my 15% discount on this. what a waste. my usual sizes range from s to l depending on what brand. i should have gotten a small. i don't think that would've helped. it was so awkward looking. nothing like the model. it made me look as if i had gained 15 pounds. it was waaay longer in the back-like a mullet. the material was really thick. it is more appropriate for fall. i had high hopes for this-to dress up or down. it was just so ridiculous.
1,Cute design. details on shoulder make the tshirt more special but it runs large so that kind of takes away from the styling. got it on super sale  so i'll keep it. maybe a wash will shrink it a bit...
-1,When i saw the dress i loved everything about it except the arms made me a little nervous. i ordered it when it went on sale and it turns it the arms are worse then i thought they would be. they are like my grandmother crochet it and accidentally attached my child's dress arms on my dress.
0,"I tried this in a size medium. i have purchased several rompers this summer and that's usually the size that fits (i'm 5'4"" and hover around 130lbs). i'm short waisted. i don't have a long torso but this just fit. if you look at the model in the pic  she's bent to one side giving the look of blousing at the top  but if you stand upright  it's very straight and smooth. i could get it to blouse over the waist but then i had to pull the bottom up so high the shorts became way to short. i like the m"
0,This shirt is cute. i like the pleated neck as it makes the top feminine  while still casual. it is made of very soft fabric and drapes nicely. the only issue is that the seam/pleat that runs down the middle is off center. i think the fabric was cut incorrectly so the seam twists to one side after i have it on for a few minutes and move around. i keep having to twist it straight which is very annoying.
-1,Horrible fit. i do not understand why they but a aline dress with a skin non aline camisole under the dress.
1,I love this top! yes  it is quite transparent  but just needs a light colored cami (i like the reversible scoop and v-neck tanks at retailer)! it's incredibly soft and light for summer time. the black motif is more like a slate gray contemporary pattern. i also really like the sewn in v-neck line. it gives the shirt a more professional touch. i'll be wearing it for work with a dark blue blazer.
0,The blouse was not flattering on me. it would be for someone with a straight slim body type  it falls mid hips and so it accentuates my hips making them look larger. it's flared so it cannot really be tucked in.
1,Obsessed with this sweatshirt! it's a must have for any loungewear lover. i'm normally a xs but sized up to a s for a more loose  relaxed look. i was afraid it would swallow me  but i love the fit! the knot in the front is a nice detail that makes this comfy top really cute. the fabric is a great texture  great for transitioning from summer to fall and winter to spring. love everything about this sweatshirt and will easily pair with leggings or jeans. worth every penny!!!
0,I really wanted to love this shirt. it looked so nice and cool for summer and i don't own anything purple. the color was really nice  very subtly feminine. i am a little too short for this style though. i am 5 ft. 1 inch  105 lbs ordered an xxs and it was still too wide. the side slits came up a little too high for my liking  but i easily could've stitched those up a bit and they'd have been fine. i think this would look great on taller women  but on me it looked like a dumpy sack.
0,I love the looks of this sweater on the model! after receiving it  it was still very pretty and stylish to look at. my problem is that i am petite  and the sweater seemed to run very large. it wasn't very fitted. i think the detailing in the back would look better fitted. it made me look rather dowdy and/or matronly unlike how it looks on the model. i think that was because it was just too big. i returned it.
0,"Think price convinced me to put this in my bag ... the oops of on line shopping i guess. the strip and 'stitch' like snowflake is just not me. a little too ""cutesy' for me. if strip alone might have kept .. but this is just too much  not my style .. back it goes."
1,Normally i am a size 10 or 12 but i sized down to a small. still very swingy and beautiful. i bought the pink and the taupe as well. the colors are beautiful and have great texture to hide stains!
-1,I ordered this skirt because it looked cute and versatile. when it arrived the pleat in front (shown in the center) was far to the right so the overall look was crooked. not sure if it was a quality control issue or if that's the true design but it will have to go back. too bad because i had high hopes!
0,I bought this tank for work  but the color of the print is slightly muted compared to the photo. i usually wear a xxs or xs (i am 100 lbs  5'1) and i got the xs thinking it will be loose  which i wanted. the arm holes were down to my waist  and it was also unusually wide. the quality of the fabric is nice though  not to heavy and not too thin.
0,Very very cute. bought in store yesterday. put it on today to wear and it is huge. i normally buy a large in tshirts. i will return for either a small or medium but will try on in the store. oh well.
0,It was way to heavy and big for someone with a petite frame like me.  i really liked the design and thought since it came in petite  i'd try it.  it would probably be better on someone much taller but the material is still too heavy.
-1,Very beautiful colors unfortunately the cut is much too tent- like and it looks like a maternity top on me. i like a flowy bohemian top but this one was too much for my tastes  sadly i sent it back.
-1,The photo misrepresents how large this sweater is. it is giant! petite ladies stay away from this sweater. i ordered an xs and usually can manage to fit in a regular xs  but this just floored me. the neckline wouldn't even stay up on my upper body  it was that loose. also the width of the sweater does not at all hug the body as shows on the model. it is like a tent. i'm so bummed. the color blue is nice and the sweater is really soft. it's too bad it doesn't fit smaller women.
0,This dress looks so elegant and perfect for transition from work to night. it looks great on the model but it looked terrible on my. it's a lovely material but the middle added girth to my stomach area which i did not care for.
1,These are so cute... i went into the store to buy something else and came out with these. i usually wear a 10 and bought a medium. these are also lower price than i expected. also  well constructed. thank you antho!!
-1,I really like this dress/shirt. it's great for layering  super cute and will hide my traditional holiday and this year's pregnancy weight gain. i think it will be so cute with some leggings and boots.  unfortunately the back panel of the dress does not seem to vary based on the size. this may sound weird but i've tried on an 8 and a 10 and the ability to reach forward didn't change between the two sizes. i just returned the 10 and am hopeful the 12 i ordered will be slightly roomier in the back.
-1,"The fabric clung to my body i expected it to flow and be breezy  it was too flimsy  the arms were too wide and overall for $100 this dress didn't cut the mustard. i'm 5'7"" 135 the dress was long enough  just didn't flow very well."
0,This dress looks like it would be so much fun to wear. when i tried it on  i was swimming in it. i do have to admit that the movement of the dress (had it fit right) would have been very fun. i was also really disappointed with the lining. there is dark green piping along the neckline  which bled through the pink of the dress and make it look like you dropped something on your dress. returning it :(
1,I loved this top when i first saw it. i tried on my usual size l  and there is no stretch through the bust  so it totally flattened my chest. a few weeks ago i noticed there were some xl's that must have been returned. i tried them on and they fit perfectly! i suggest sizing up if you have a chest  this is a very flattering top and it looks great paired with scarves as a wrap  skinny jeans and boots.

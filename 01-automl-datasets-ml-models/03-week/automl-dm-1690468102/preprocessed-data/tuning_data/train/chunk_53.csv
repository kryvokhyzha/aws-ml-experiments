-1,"But it runs super small. i wear a medium for everything but couldn't come close to buttoning this. the buttons were about 4 inches apart (horizontally)  probably should have ordered an extra large in order to fit. the quality and styling seemed great but ordering online requires ""truth in sizing"""
-1,I was hesitant to buy this because it is double breasted which isn't my first choice. that was the least of the problems with this jacket. i love sparkle  and i love beautiful detail  none of the elements by themselves was a problem. the sum of the parts didn't work  though. the end result was an unflattering  confusing mess. the silhouette plus the frayed edges  plus the sequins plus the vent in back plus the huge buttons plus the double breast  plus the zipper were just too many things to go t
0,I am wearing a medium in the photos and for reference my measurements are 38-30-40. i did not purchase this top.
1,"I tried this on in the store and was pleasantly surprised at how cute it was! i'm 5'4"" and the large fits me loosely but is still shapely. because it's a little longer on me  it's great to wear both to work and on the weekends. just wish it came in more colors! you can't see the color in the photo  but there's a sea green lining which is a cute touch!"
0,The fit is really flattering and cute but the fabric and finishings seem really cheap. it's a printed plaid - not woven.
0,I actually love this dress.  the colors on the dark gray are mesmerizing.  the design of the placket adds a special touch to the look.  my issue is the way it looks on my body--not flattering.  i already have a squarish apple (squarple?!) body and the cut emphasizes this more.  i was hoping the fabric would hang on me the same way the ivory dress on the curly haired model does  so i sized up.  all this did was make me look wider  especially at the shoulders.  the drawstring at the elastic makes
-1,These leggings are loose fitting and the quality is just not there.. i am returning the item.
0,I ordered this dress before it became available in my local retailer store. i love the style of this dress but the fabric was not as expected. it is a heavy/fuzzy knit and i had envisioned something lighter and cleaner. i would love to see it in a different fabric! sadly returned it....
1,First of all  this jean fits really well  but i usually wear a 31 in mother jeans and i had to go up to a 32 in these (ugh!) because they just ran smaller or whatever. i am curvy on the bottom but the 31's just felt too tight and pulled everywhere.  second  the color is not quite right in this picture; it looks more military green. it is not - it is a much brighter military green vs a moss green. that is throwing me a bit. not quite as versatile or neutral to me.  meanwhile  the styling with the
-1,The fabric and its texture didn't meet my expectations unfortunately. there were too much fray and cast-off of edge yarns of a fabric...   however this will fit if you wear over the swimming wears.
-1,I wore this blazer for one day  didn't do anything strenuous  and the fabric started to disintegrate along the back  next to the center seam. it's completely unfixable  since it's not the seam that split but the fabric itself. what a waste of money.    as to the fit  it is a boxy cut through the waist. it looks better unbuttoned than buttoned. the jacket also shows a lot of the shirt you have under it  so it's good over something cute.    or  it would be  if it didn't fall apart.
1,The dress has some cute features. the little belt motif hits too high on me and the drop waist is a little awkward. but it is comfortable and looks best with some kind of shirt worn underneath
-1,What an adorable and frustrating skirt! i'm not a large person: 32d-26-36. and i ordered my normal size small. this is a pull on skirt  and the waist opening could not accommodate either my shoulders or my hips. in most retailer clothes  i'm either a size 2 or 4; i have to agree with the other reviewer. there is no way to put this item on.
0,This dress runs a bit small. the large arm holes were unflattering to my small chest. also  this dress seemed to make my belly protrude. it kind of made me look pregnant in a way that no other dress has! i could see this dress being flattering on someone with a very flat stomach or a large chest. not me!!
1,First thing i would say these pants run large i'm a size 6 the size 4 fit perfect i love the style and look of the cascade fabric on leg of these pants but these pants are a little heavy still a beautiful pant
1,I look at the top quite a few times before i bought it.  i absolutely love it !  it's a super soft thick cotton material   it drapes perfectly and wears well.
0,I love the length of this and that i can wear it with skinny jeans or leggings  but it does seem to run a little small and it is not as long as on the model. i do think it is a cute addition to my wardrobe though.
0,For reference: 5'3  130#  athletic/muscular body type (broad shoulders  slim hips)  i ordered the small and i was absolutely swimming in it. perhaps the petite would have been better  but there was just too much fabric everywhere. the sleeves were ridiculous on me  and even cinching the waist with a belt just wouldn't have slimmed the silhouette for me. i have muscular shoulders  and 34d chest  so the top fit as it should  just everything became way too much elsewhere. the fabric was soft and sw
-1,This piece didn't make sense to me.  maybe it's bc i'm a yankee fan but it reminded me of a high end baseball jersey that was sheer.  i didn't think it was office appropriate but too dressy for casual wear.  it went back.
-1,I love the dress as shown in the photo. thankfully i had a chance to see the dress in the store. it is sheer. can see thru it. can not wear this to work.
1,"This dress is very feminine and flattering on  especially for hourglass figure gals. i usually wear size 4 regular in this brand but i sized up to 6 regular (i'm 34b  26 waist  36 hips). when it's very fitted on top  i like my dress to be a bit longer. the bottom hem falls about 2 inches longer on me than shown on the model (i'm 5'2""). it feels tight when first zipped because the dress is cut to fit the curves of a woman  but it loosens up after a few minutes of wear. the design of this dress is"
0,"This top is very pretty  but it fits funny. it's boxy and doesn't hang well. i feel like you could almost wear it as a 2nd-trimester-pregnancy-blouse. i tried the small & the small petite. they both fit the same (too big and too boxy)  but the petite was shorter. i am 5'2""  125lbs  34b. i preferred the regular length  but if you like your tops to end at your waistband  then the petite would fit too. i still really like the top  so i may try it in a smaller size when it goes on sale."
0,"I ordered my normal size and found that this top runs large. i wanted to tie the front ties tighter to accentuate my waist  but even so it was still quite loose. the fabric is very stretchy and thin  and the top was longer on me than pictured in the model. for reference  i am 5'-7"" 155lbs  usually wear a medium/8 in a top. this medium was too large."
1,The colors are beautiful on this shirt and it is true to size. it is very comfortable but i wish the flowing part on top was pinned under arms or something. it is attached at the top of the tank top but nowhere else so it just kind of lays over the tank with a poncho look.i also think the top layer would look better if it was longer- it hits at my natural waist and i'm petite. i still plan on keeping it and think it will be cute enough with jeans. just really wanted to love it!
1,I like the dress on line: color flowers  cut  etc. but when i tried it on it was just meh... the color did wash me out a bit  the flowers are still beautiful  but the cut wasn't as flattering on my body as it was on the model. 0p fit ok  but i didn't keep it. you ahve to tie your own shoulder straps  so adjustable  i guess that is a plus.    115 lbs 30 dd  26.5 in waist
1,I hope you can get this top.this is a great classic that will be in my closet for a long time.
0,The mustard colour was much stronger than it seems in the picture and it wasn't pretty on me. plus the sleeves were very wide so that makes this not good for petite frames in my opinion. it does run big - i ordered m (and i usually take m or even l in retailer clothes)  but i could have tried a s to make it less boxy. too bad though  because it's a pretty shirt and different.
-1,Had high hopes for this seemingly cute skirt to use as a basic in my spring and summer outfits. however  that was not the case. this skirt is not lined and the material is so so. basically  for the price  i was underwhelmed and will return it.
1,Thanks to the vertical stripes  the adjustable neckline  the bow that cinches the waist  and the free flowing skirt  this dress is extremely flattering. the compliments i received when wearing this dress back that up! i was unsure if i should order a medium or large because i typically wear either/or depending on the dress style due to my hips. i ordered a large which fit thanks to the adjustable neckline and adjustable waist  but a medium definitely would have worked just as well for me (i just
1,Amazing dress! i'm a pear shape  and this dress is a very complimentary cut for me. it's also not too short. the color print on the dress are amazing. i'm very happy!
1,Love this dress! it fits perfectly  is flattering  and the fabric is high quality. i ordered the blue print  and it is a vibrant turquoise. i may order in the charcoal as well  as this is a comfortable  cute dress for everyday casual. i am 5'7  135 lbs and the size 4 was perfect  even a tad bit loose  but i prefer a bit loose to tight  especially with the design with the buttons up the front.
-1,I wanted to love this dress  however it has no shape to it. it is also somewhat see through  so something needs to be worn under it. i feel like i received a dress that has been stretched out and returned. i'm extremely disappointed. i do not recommend.
0,This is a pretty dress  but it runs at least one size too large. the silk is of good quality. it would be good for somebody who is slim and tall.
0,"I'm 5'6""  34b/32c  apprx 125#  & lift weights so i have bigger/muscular lats  back  arms. my lower half i wear sz 25 mother  ag  or 7 mankind jeans  but upper is more med (4-6 sz). hips apprx 35""  waist 28"". my tops: i don't like things tight. i ordered medium  top fits perfect  but waist/hips i have take in as more like a rigid/stiff  gunny sax cottony type fabric  not super light chiffon as photos appear. the under lining super short in front and top of calf in back  but lining follows the she"
-1,I have been struggling to find a nice flowy summer dress that isn't too short. i am petite but do not like to wear my dresses too far above the knee  so i ordered this in the 00 regular. this dress was not what i expected. it is not flowy  but rather a heavy and stiff fabric. it is also way too wide. it looks like it can't decide whether to be a box or a bag. it is also shorter than advertised. last thing to disappoint was the color - darker and more muted than the photo on the website. i can't
-1,It's sheer  the design /print is casual  but on silk like material. had it been made out of cotton would have definitely kept it! who is going to wear this in the blazing heat of summer???
1,"When this appeared on line  i thought t would be a sure thing  color (blue)  cut and style  this dress appeared to have been made for me  but i ultimately i ended up returning it for several reasons. fit: i was worried about the length on my 5'5"" frame but it was actually long enough. i have narrow shoulders and average arms but i found the shoulders or maybe it was the upper arms to run slightly small in my regular size which caused some strange poofing at the shoulders. not sure if going up a"
1,I bought this shirt at the store and after going home and trying it on  i promptly went online and ordered two more! i've gotten multiple compliments anytime i wear any of them. great for looking put together with no fuss.   people that have commented there's were destroyed in the wash didn't read the care label which says dry clean.
0,"I wear a typical 25 in coh jeans and i ordered these in a 25. they fit but they feel more like jeggings than skinny jeans. the wash isn't as faded out as in the picture. and at 5'2"" the rip is right at my kneecap. i bought these for the distressed wash  and will probably return this pair as it looks darker and less faded in person. i look nothing like the model does in this pair of jeans."
1,As always these pilcro pants did not disappoint. i can always order a size 26 and know they will fit like a custom pant. i actually like the fit on me better than shown on the model. there is no crotch hang like in the photo. i need to wear heels with these because of the length but heels and flares are very slimming.
-1,I love this top so much online. i received it yesterday in the mail and unfortunately i am very disappointed.  there is nothing wrong with the quality but i do think it looks more appealing online. also  this top is probably not for anyone with a large chest. it looks nice and drapey on the model. when i put it on it just makes me look fat and the top (thanks to my 38dds) looks more like a swing top. i'm sure it's a lovely top on very thin people with a smaller chest.
-1,The cutout design of this suit looks cute on the model but didn't flatter my shape. i think it would work better on someone very thin. the criss-cross fabric portion was a bit baggy and didn't sit right. even worse  the bust portion made me look flat (and i'm a full c cup).
1,Saw this in my local retailer and thought it was stunning. i usually wear a size 8 because of my broad shoulders but ended up taking a 6 in this top. it was not tight in the arms (don't have super skinny arms) and the fabric flows nicely (not too much). the embroidery is amazing and am sure this top will be in rotation quite a bit!
0,I was excited to buy this sweater based on the online pictures.  although the ombre coloring is beautiful in person  i did not like the metallic trim at waist & cuffs.  the pictures don't really show the extreme brightness of the trim.  it looks literally like xmas ribbons were sewn into the sweater.  to me it looked like something a child would wear.  i ordered the 1  which was the smallest size offered.  it is oversized without much shape and i felt it added bulk around the middle.
0,I was really pulling for this dress to work because it's beautiful  however the neckline is cut so extremely low that i had to return. it's much higher on the model than in real life. the petite length was still far too long  so additional hemming required  otherwise fit was true to size (5'3  130 lbs  size 6p)
-1,I ordered my usual medium. the tops length came only to my waist  and was wide and unflatering.   the armholes were right under my arms. too bad as this looked so cute in the picture. i returned.
0,I loved the look of this tunic. it is made well and very pretty. it was so big and heavy i had to return it. i think the small in this would be too big.
1,Great transition into fall. super soft and comfy. great yellow without being too yellow love it.
1,"Super soft and cute. the buttons add a nice touch. the color depicted online gave me pause  but when i saw it in the store it was more of a blue than that what you see in pic. great investment. beautiful sweater. 34c  65""  135 and the small is perfect."
-1,Loved these in store when i tried them on but was in between sizes so i ordered them in the larger size. boy do i regret that! these stretch out so much i have to wear a belt with them and it gives me this saggy bunchy front when i sit...not attractive. wish i could return them  but i took the tag off and wore them not knowing this before hand!! if in between sizes definitely size down.
0,I fell in love with this romper and it was my go-to for any given day  but as soon it got wet the blue dye bled everywhere  so i had to return it.
0,"I got the pilcro hyphen chinos in a size 25p and they fit  so i assumed i would be the same size in the pilcro stet chinos...nope. the 25p was way short and way tight. i'm 5'3"" and about 113 lbs. my mom is 5' and 98 lbs and they fit her so i gave the 25p stet chinos to her to keep. disappointed!"
0,This dress isn't as fitted as it looks on the model. it appear to be more of a shift dress. as gorgeous as the print and quality are  it doesn't look great on me. for reference  i'm 5'5 105lbs and bought xs. for whatever reason  the high neckline isn't flattering on me. i do personally think this dress is perfect if you have broad shoulders.
1,I purchased the blue version in store. it's a nice royal blue  not navy. (although the it could be worn with navy.) i thought the fit was flattering. the middle piece (pleat?) is less obvious on the blue than the purple. the tie at the neck can be untied and it is still not too low cut.
0,I really liked this top but when i tried it on it was big and too boxy. i considered ordering it in petite but the sales person said that the cut would be the same  boxy but shorter so i decided to pass.
1,I love this top. of course i love most things that are denim  or look like denim. this is a fun twist on a denim shirt  the flutter sleeves and side panels make it different and eye catching. i have gotten so many compliments on it when i wear it! pairing this top with white or black pants or a skirt allows me to wear denim to work and still look professional.
0,"Not up to retailer standards! fabric quite thin(you could see nude-color bra through the white one) and thin fabric  wide bottom hung sloppy; no way i would feel ""well dressed"" in this top. i returned it."
1,"First  i noticed that the ""grey"" was more like a blue-grey/navy which i don't mind because it's still a nice  unique color.  i ordered petite size 26 and although these are very well made/sturdy cords and fit at the ankle like the model pictured  the thigh/calves were surprisingly a bit too tight for me (and my calves are s c r a w n y).  this cord version doesn't seem as stretchy as some of their other styles so  i'm going back for the standard 26's!"
1,This is definitely my go to top for work  weekends or night out with the husband. i've worn it with skinny jeans  black tights and skirts. it goes with just about anything. easy to accessorize with a simple long chain necklace or a statement piece. i think the gray combo was a bit more flattering than the green combo.
0,As much as i had wanted this to work for me  it didn't. fabric is not as soft as i had expected and quality is just bad. i purchased this online (on sale at $29.95) and i had envisioned this to be comfy stretchy and swingy with a flow. i sent this back to the store as it didn't seem fit even at the low price.
-1,This skirt for sure was the most disappointing thing i've ever ordered from retailer. it looks like an all white skirt that has a little stiffness to it but looks are deceiving. it has this weird checkered patten and there is no shape to the skirt at all. there are also weird stitching lines. one more thing that i didn't like about the skirt was that it's a cream-ish color. not even the cute flamingos will make me keep this skirt. it's going back.
-1,I love the design and the fabric  but the fit is just off on this dress. the area around the bust is just not fitted well. the wrap portion of the dress in this area gaps and does not lie flat. that is an easy enough fix with a good seamstress  but the waist also sat too high on me (maybe i'm long waisted  who knows?)  so between the super high waist and the flannel-type fabric  it just looked kind of like a bath robe on me. i wish it weren't so. i was so hoping for a cool plaid dress that i cou
-1,Great color  soft fabric  but waaaaay too long. more like a night shirt than a t-shirt.
-1,I tried this blouse on in the store. i'm generally an 8 or 10 in this brand. i got down to a size 4 and gave up. this blouse is huge all the way around. the detail on the blouse is pretty  but the tent like cut made it impossible for me to buy it. i know retailers blouses can be swingy and flows but this went way beyond. perhaps on a tall person the swing would work but on a short person like myself...i looked ridiculous.
0,It was ok. very swingy and lots of fabric at the bottom. the pocket seemed to not sit in the right spot like it was too far over and i wanted to keep adjusting the position of the shirt. i might buy it on sale but i sent it back bc it's definitely not worth $60.
0,I adored this suit - the style  the colors  the thick quality of the fabric...but unfortunately the bottom seams cut into my groin and backside so much  it was practically painful! i'm 5'7'  128 lbs  and usually wear a size small  but was advised to size up. even with the medium i tried on  everything fit well but the length  though i've never thought i had a long torso. sizing up to a large would make the bust way to large for my small b chest. was so sad to return this suit!
-1,Too tight in strange ways. beautiful dress i was so excited to receive it  however it just did not fit.
-1,This is not even a dolman style sweater because it's loose fitting everywhere around the arm. the point of a dolman sweater is that the sleeves are fitted around the wrist/forearm  but this is not the case with this sweater. it's super loose around the wrist area - i can fit both of my wrists into a sleeve.
-1,For reference i am 5'5' 138 lbs with an hourglass figure and my usual small fit perfectly. the problems: 1. this skirt is not black but a charcoal gray/purple. 2. the sipper is reinforces with a stiff boarder on the inside so no matter where i put the waist it sticks straight out making me look like i have a tail under my skirt. in other words  i had a very pointy butt. also the slit or tulip part of the skirt goes all the way up to the waist  it needed to be tacked to the other part of the skir
-1,Seemed pretty shapeless which surprised me because of the design. perhaps it was just too big. returned it.
1,This tee is so soft and comfy. it looks nicer than a regular tee but still casual. fits true to size  and not too loose  but not too clingy. i know i'll wear this one a lot!

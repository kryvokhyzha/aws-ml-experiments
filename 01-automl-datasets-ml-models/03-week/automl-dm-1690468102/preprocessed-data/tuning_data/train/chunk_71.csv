0,I was so excited when this dress arrived today. as other reviewers have mentioned  the fabric is lovely  soft and drapey and it feels great on. it felt great  that is  until i looked in the mirror. while the dress fit fine  i have a large bust  and the fabric stretched across the bust  causing the print to appear washed out across the bust. not a good look. sigh. another return.
-1,Length too long and waist to high. these are not sized for petites.
0,I really like the look of these socks  and have become obsessed we over-the-knee socks for winter this year. they are very tick which is nice for keeping warm and for durability for a long lasting product. my only complaint is that they are very difficult to get over the knee. this can be a great thing  because they certainly do stay put-which is a huge problem with over-the-knee socks. however  by the end of the day i was pretty sure i was going to lose a leg from poor circulation.  i am still
1,I run between an xs and s in most retailer shirts. i went with the xs in this one and was glad i did. the fit is lovely and flattering. i loved this shirt the second i put it on -- then went to order it in another color.
-1,These fit around the waist but there is so much fabric and it poofs out and looks awful and bulky. no way.
-1,"I've been buying from retailer for the last 15 years and this is the first time i've ever posted a bad review. first of all the fabric is scratchy  thin  and looks very cheap. second of all there is no v back  it's more of a slight scoop. and lastly i'm 5'3"" so i ordered the petite small and it's still comes 4 inches below my knee. i am very disappointed in the quality and am definitely sending back. the only thing i think this could possible good for is a swim coverup."
1,"Softest denim -- they feel like they've been through the wash a hundred times already! i'm pleased that the belt is removable as it adds just a bit too much bulk for me. i'm 5'4"" and bought the petite for a perfect fit. these will become a go-to pair!"
1,I love this dress! it fits me so well and is extremely comfortable. i can't wait until it gets a little warmer so i can wear it with a trench and cute flats or heeled sandals.
-1,I saw this dress online and loved the colors and whimsical embroidery . i thought it would be the perfect dress to wear on the weekend with cute sandals. i was excited when the dress arrived in the mail as the colors were vibrant and the material was soft and cozy. unfortunately this dress is huge. it is a rectangle with pockets. i bought the xxsp  my usual size and this dress was so big my sister was able to fit in it with me.this dress was beyond alterations. too bad it was a great idea but no
0,Beautiful top  the silk was good quality  not thin. ordered a 6 because it was selling out so quickly  wished i could have ordered the 4. will definitely try if they come back in stock.
1,"This is a gorgeous piece-the pattern and color combination are classic fall. the sleeves for a xs/s are slightly short (i am 5'8"") but the rest of the fit is great. with the type of fabric and poncho-style  i would recommend wearing something underneath."
1,This top is very feminie  i love hte pelats and flower details. it can be  however  a bit boxy  i think if you have wider hips  i might avoid. great to go with skinny pants/ejans  though. could size down  if shoulders are not too wide...
0,I was excited to receive in hopes to wear more as a tunic over skinnies vs a dress for fall. this runs sooo very large. the material is thick  and the pattern is just ok. didn't do anything for my hourglass shape. returned.
-1,I was so excited for this kimono. i thought the colors would be lovely. i was looking for a unique wrap/vest/kimono. i ordered this online expecting to be dazzled. sadly  i was not. this arrived and fell short on all measures. the colors were flat  the fabric felt cheap and the construction did not scream $108. it felt like something i would find in a college import/head shop. back it went. i ended up buying the silves wrap  which i love.
1,Absolutely love this in blue. the cut and fit are flowy while still having a flattering shape. the colors and pattern are accurate on screen - vibrant and rich. the tie front is a pretty detail allowing the top to feel a little dressy. very happy with this purchase!
0,"The minute i put this on i knew it was wrong. firstly  the neck was quite tight and i had to untie the side tie. secondly  as i stood looking in the mirror  the dress simply read ""nightgown"". it was frumpy and too long on me. so back it went."
1,I will preface this review by stating that this item was available only in one size at my local retailer. they have a section of dresses mostly offered online that are in store for you to touch  see  try on and order through the store (which is much appreciated). i am normally a size 0-2/xs in retailer clothes and i will typically order a petite when available. the option my store had to try on was a regular medium which is what i have pictured here.    i mostly wanted to try it on just to get a fee
1,"I almost passed this in the store  but i am glad that i tried it! i really like that the fabric is so soft and has a ""blouse"" feel... and is machine washable! yay! love nice blouses that don't need to be dry cleaned! i would describe the material as thicker  so some may not like this for warmer weather. looks great with a long necklace like the minuet! i am typically a small and purchased this in an extra-small and still have plenty of room."
-1,"I didn't have a problem anticipating the fit of this dress. i felt with the drawstrings on each side i could make it work. i usually take a large and even ordered a medium as i had read all the reviews of it running big. when i got the dress  i was beyond disappointed. it is a heavy  itchy polyester-like fabric  not a thin rayon looking texture like the picture shows. it is also a deep black  not the plum color in 4/5 photos. but most importantly  i am 5'8"" and the dress is very short on me. it'"
0,The dress is not like pictured. it is above the knee and sleeves are neither 3/4 nor full length-somewhere in between. i am 5'4  112 lbs  bought xs regular. had higher expectations for the price. going back to the store.
1,I was hesitant to buy this top after reading previous reviews  but i love it! granted  i am two months postpartum so i am looking for tops that are airy (it's summer in socal) but cover up my tummy. the material is soft and stretchy and it does have a loose shelf bra type inset---so not a real bra but at least something there. i wore a free people bralette with it and it looked perfect! really happy with this top!
-1,The armholes on this dress are totally bizarre. i can't believe no one else has commented on them yet. i am a size s on top and m on the bottom so i usually try on both in dresses. i tend to be a small/ size 6 in retailer. the armholes are so long that the dress doesn't lay right on top. i showed it to on of the clerks in the store and she agreed with me. we looked at all the others and they were the same. going up a size made it way worse. this dress might work for someone with really broad shoul
0,"I bought the s; came with a tag saying ""sz 8"". it is in fact more like a size 2  if not 0.     the bust is probably a 34 a or b  or 32a or b - the cups fit me relatively well  but the rest was so tight that i could barely manage to put put it in. i can't imagine wrestling with this bathing suit each time i want to wear it  so i will return it.     the fabric  design is as spectacular as it looks though... very good quality."
0,Is a great top for layering over leggings  running errands or after the gym. the material was thin. i returned it because the color didn't look great on me and for the price  i just didn't love it.
0,These run small. i normally wear 28 on ag stevie's and paige jeans so i ordered these in 28 and they were very tight. otherwise very well made and super cute but i had to return them.
1,The print and fit of this dress is perfect! it's very flattering and slimming.
0,I recommend this topper but with reservations. it is beautiful looking  especially the lace portion.   it is also very wide. the gathered portion is a complete design fail  it balloons up right below the bust  making one look wide and pretty ridiculous. it's obvious that the model is hiding the gathered poof by placing her arms close to her body. but i knew this from the other reviews posted here so it was no surprise.   i ordered size s  the smallest available  and it fit very wide more like a
0,"This fabric of this top is gorgeous. however  i'm 5' 5"" and it hits in a really weird spot. right no the point of the hip that you don't want to accentuate. you could wear it with leggings to a casual thing  but i work in an office so its too short to wear with leggings and too long to wear with jeans. sad  i love the top 90% of it."
-1,"If you are thinking about purchasing this dress without trying on in person  i bet you aren't going to be happy with it. for a phisique that is 5' 3"" and 115lbs  this dress is not too short. however  the back key hole design is just not flattering. i felt like clothes in the back shoulder area is not fitted well and the zip up closure is not all the way zipped up even though it was so."
-1,I was really excited after finding this top online and reading the reviews; the combination of peplum  cap sleeves  and color seemed too good to be true. i ordered a size medium but unfortunately  this top is on the short side so wearing it with pants or jeans did not work out. in addition  the fabric was more sheer than it looks in the picture and the v-neck in front dipped a little lower  too. a camisole might have solved both of those problems but i didn't bother. i returned it to the store.
0,This blouse is a beautiful color and i love the dot design and texture. however  it is a much baggier fit than i expected based on the photo  and it looks a little bit like a maternity shirt on me. i usually wear a size 8 or 10 and i bought a size medium.
1,This is a beautiful blue color and a fun swing design. it is very short so will be limited with what you can wear it with. looks very cute with higher waisted jeans and pencil skirts. it is wide but has a lovely flow/swing to it. love the fabric and it is a nice change to everyday style in wardrobe. so if you want something fun and flirty and feminine and you do not mind short this is your top.
-1,Really wanted to luv this top buttt it ran small in arm length & in the front  bottom...backside was perfect coverage...also most important this top is see-through! item as pictured is not accurate!
0,I wanted a casual but special summer dress and had high hopes for this one. i normally like to try things on as it is difficult to tell fit online. when it arrived i was disappointed with this dress. it is very full in the skirt  the top fit a bit odd  not a lot of shape and not especially flattering. the fabric wasn't very exciting either.  unfortunately this one went back.
-1,It just isn't that flattering on me. it looks kind of old and dingy  even though it's brand new. it fits fine  but doesn't do much to highlight my curves. it just kind of hangs there. the length is somewhat awkward (i bought the petite version). maybe it would look good on someone tall and skinny  like the model. it's gathered around the stomach area and longer in the front  which reminded me of maternity wear. it does appear to be pretty well made; top part is lined. overall it's not terrible 
0,I fell in love with this skirt when i saw it on display so i had the store order me an xspetite. it seemed like the perfect lightweight summer skirt that would go with everything. it arrived today and i was a bit underwhelmed with the way it actually fit on me. it is kind of a thick linen/cottony material and just didn't lay down well  bunching out on the sides in a way i didn't find to be very flattering. so 5 stars for print and whimsy and charm  but 3 stars for actual fit on. alas it is going
-1,I really wanted to love this dress but it was not right for me.   made my curvy body look shapeless.  also had a button crack before i even put it on.  returned it.
1,I'm very picky about jumpers  and this one is abolutely perfect! i love how it looks like a dress at first glance. it runs a little big because of the oversized fit it is supposed to have  i sized down because of the armpit area. nude garments and you'll be fine. this is going to sell out fast  don't wait for it to go on sale! (seriously my store is already out of xs's)
-1,I loved this top online and even more when i opened it up. however  the quality of the stitching is poor. where the seam comes together at the hip on both sides  the stitching is very loose and appears to be coming undone. i was bummed and am sending it back today.
0,I was so excited to purchase this dress for my masters graduation party. it looks beautiful on but i could not get over one little detail. the structure of the top falls funny on your chest - a bit too high from the rest of the pulled fabric. it doesn't look right. if you have a necklace that falls perfectly on the piece of fabric  like the main photo shown  you are good. the third photo with the short necklace shows this issue best.
-1,This blouse is quite stiff. i wouldn't mind the boxiness if this blouse weren't so long. even if you size down  because of the eyelet and the cute hem  it would be difficult to shorten this blouse to fit.
-1,"I got this sweater with high hopes to wear it with some leggings for christmas. it looked adorable (and long!) on the model. however  it doesn't even cover my butt  that's how short it is. if you're anything over 5'4""  i'd say it'll be too short for leggings."
0,I wanted this dress in wine for a holiday party. but it just has no life whatsoever. unlike prior reviewer  i found nothing to dislike about the fabric. the fabric is fine and the fit is fine. i'm sometimes an 8 and sometimes a 6; took this in an 8 and definitely would not size down. it's relatively close- and well-fitting  but the sleeves and neckline further ruined it for me. the sleeves are shapeless  long and baggy. the neckline is just blah. it needs to be neater  trimmer  more cut. the ruc
-1,I ordered an xxs online and it's still massive. the only thing i can use it for is a beach coverup. the embroidery is pretty but i will be returning.
0,"Loved the grey color and the design but the shirt ran huge. i ordered a 2 and it fit me like an extra large. i am 5'2"" about 110 pounds and not flat chested."
-1,"After reading every review  i was certain i knew exactly what i was getting with this dress. wrong. i sized up from a small to a medium and the dress was still uncomfortably tight on my rib cage. the top is very exposing of the bust  and i'm small busted. i can't stand wearing camis  so there no way i'd be able to wear this dress even if i sized up again to a large. for reference  i'm 5'6""  a straight build 134 lbs  and wear a 6. pluses on this dress are  i loved the green color and length of sk"
1,I love this shirt. the colors are just as depicted. the material is gorgeous and the top is very flattering. fits true to size for retailer small (i'm normally a medium outside of this store).
-1,Very small! so disappointed! they did not even have a size for me to exchange a day later when they arrived!
0,I really like this skirt but unfortunately there is no lining  so it's a bit see through under the light. also there is no hook at the top of the zipper to secure the skirt. i just think that with this kind of price  the skirt should come at least with the lining. otherwise  it's beautiful skirt  flowy and very feminine.
-1,"Ah! i wanted to love this but without anything under it (as pictured)  the petite sizing reveals way too much side boob. i am 5'3"" and a small b cup. i ordered an xs petite. it fits but there isn't enough material under the armpits. the fabric and design is great other than this flaw. sadly returning."
1,Fits well  comfortable and flattering. i wouldn't call this pattern fabric purple though. it is definitely multi colored and purple should not be called the dominate color.. the picture is an accurate representation of the color.
0,Snags very very easily.  i hadent even gotten to take the tags off and it rubbed against another item and snagged! so disappointed as it is a beautiful top  lovely color and beautifully detailed! i'm so disappointed i was hoping to keep it but will be sending it back.
0,This suit is so adorable! i love the retro style and the two patterns and i really wish it worked for me. the suit is comfy  seems well made and fit nicely. but  although it fit technically  i don't like the way it cuts me off at the thigh. it's not flattering for me at all.     the suit is kind of a neoprene material  so it's thicker than a normal bathing suit  so i think even though it isn't lined  it might not be see-through  but i didn't get it wet to test it out. in terms of fit  i think it
-1,I really wanted this dress to be perfect  but the skirt portion flares out in a way that was not flattering. the other reviewer is about 8 inches taller than me  perhaps it works better on a taller frame.
1,This is a beautiful shirt. i purchased the top in navy  the silver touch is pretty. i usually wear a size 8 or 10 and m was perfect  tts. great for work or casual party.
1,I love this robe  it is my new favorite for lounging around the house
-1,I've never spent this much money on a sweater but took the plunge using the retailer day discount. still painful but hopeful it would be worth it. i ordered the xl hoping to compensate for the shorter length. and it fell just below my hip bones so that part was okay. while this looks like the cashmere is on the thinner side  so the garment flows nicely  it's not. the weight of the sweater is substantial  heavier and much thicker than it looks. the color is different too. it's tan and grey  not whi
-1,"This is a very pretty sweater  a bit boxy and short but cute. i am 5'1"" and ordered the regular xs in black. the thing i did not like about this sweater was the gold thread through the back lace. i would have kept this if it was plain black lace. just did not like that look."
1,"I love this top. the quality is excellent. the blouse is lined and falls nicely.. i like to wear it with a pair of dark gray jeans. the color is described as ""orange""  but it really has more of a bronze tone. looks very rich and exotic. it's perfect top when you want to wear jeans  but want to dress it up a bit."
0,This top is cute. i purchased a 2 instead of my usual size 4 and it fits well. i only recommend buying this top on sale. it is not good quality! there are loose threads hanging out of the seams all over the place and it is see through. it is totally nuts that it costs $88.
1,This top is easy to dress up with a blazer or wear casually with jeans and trainers. so many nice details and a great fit!
1,This rich color is so flattering!  i also love that it has pockets and can be worn to dressy events or can be worn in more casual settings.  the side stripes give it a young and interesting touch.  the elastic waste makes it comfortable so i know i will get lots of use out of this.  i knocked off one star because of the price.  i plan on paring this with tan sandals and a dark denim blazer to start off with.
1,I love this dress. it is so cute! i have another dress from the same brand (hutch) in almost the exact same shape/style so i was excited to see this one is so similar to the other dress i love. i am 5ft 8in and 145lbs  and medium fits perfectly. it's snug at the top (but not tight) and the skirt is full but not too full. the fabric is slightly thinner than i expected  but still like it a lot. if i could change one thing  it would be one inch longer....hits a tiny bit more above the knee than i t
0,This sweater is ok. i love  love  love bell sleeves so i thought for sure this would be perfect. i thought it would be a great sweater to transition from winter to spring  but once it arrived  i knew i had to return. the sleeves are not only bell but very long and the sweater fits chunky on your midsection. i like my sweaters more flowy. if you like fitted-style sweaters that are a bit roomy you would like this once. also  it's a bit itchy for me-but i'm rather sensitive and if i'd loved this on
-1,"I'm on the shorter (5''3"") side of the spectrum and usually wear an xs in retailer. this is a lovely suit but it didn't work at all for me. it might work well on a taller person or someone who is longer waisted. the ruching and fuller cut leg was not flattering on me at all. it was very tight and pinched. sadly  i returned it."
-1,Just not cute. i don't know how else to describe this top. i am a 34dd and ordered a large. it fit and was comfortable but the peplum had way too much fabric it actually made me look much bigger than i am. i would possibly have tried a medium but it wasn't in store so i returned.
0,This dress is everything i hoped it would be--bright  colorful  quality jacquard  classic silhouette. unfortunately it runs small up top on the bust and i couldn't even zip it up all the way. returning :(
1,I got this shirt in an xxsp  and it has a great slim body. the front ruffle isn't overpowering  although i don't love the ruffles on the sleeves. i think it's just a little too much  but they aren't visible under a sweater or jacket. the length is just right  so the shirt can be tucked in or left untucked without looking long and messy. the silk is just a touch sheer but not too see-through. it's a good shirt.
1,7 months pregnant with twins and i prefer to buy regular clothes that can be worn post pregnancy as well as when pregnant. went to a dr. apt and the receptionist loved this shirt. i told her it was non-maternity and she can buy it at retailer... i think she stopped by on her way home from work.
1,I was so excited about the arrival of my maza dress. much to my surprise the material was not has structured as i thought it would be from the photos. the fit was very tight and did not fall as nicely as i anticipated. because i loved the classic design i decided to give it another chance so i returned it for the next size up and fell in love  the open sleeve was a nice surprise with a touch if elegance. the front buttons added a bit of old charm and feminine appeal. while the material was not v
1,I bought this lovely silk/velvet shirt in the &quot;sky&quot; color but it is more on the teal blue side than sky blue  which disappointed me. it is definitely darker than appears in photo. still a luxurious well-made beauty with sassy appeal. it drapes like a snake slithering down your body. it comes with attitude.

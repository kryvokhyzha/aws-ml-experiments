1,This coat is really beautiful  and pictures don't do it justice. it runs very large. i'm normally an xl or l in sweaters  but because of the balloony shape  i actually took a medium - even then it looks like i'm being enveloped  so i prefer to wear it unsnapped.
0,This dress is very pretty and we'll made. it runs pretty big though and i would suggest going a size down.
1,I saw this peasant blouse online and thought it looked cute  but not really enough to spend the money on. i purchased a few other things instead. i happened to go into the store to see a different top in person and spotted this one. it is definitely cuter in person. as with most tops like this  it is baggy and loose. however  probably due to the elastic at the bottom  this one doesn't look overly big and shapeless. just a pretty top that will be perfect for spring. for reference  i am 5'6 115  a
0,"When i ordered this all the petite sizes were no longer available. i tried the xs. it was actually a nice length for me (5'4"") and even the arm openings were not too large which is a plus. i expected all the extra flow and material on the back of the tunic but there was too much fabric on the front too...very unflattering. if it had been a closer fit on the front i probably would have kept it. the color is very nice but the fabric is pretty standard...nothing that makes it stand out. it is very"
-1,I wanted to love this product so badly. i ordered it in the mail  and it looked beautiful coming out of the box. i normally look really nice in grey  but this color really washed me out and was not nice on. the fabric is very sheer  so you would have to wear it over a camisole/tank top. this is one of those pieces that looks better on the hanger than in person. large in arms  small on body. odd fit.
-1,I really liked this dress in pictures online. i wanted to wear it to work on casual fridays. everything about this dress was a disappointment  especially at this price point. the fit was weird: tight in some places  too loose in others (i'm usually xs or s  i ordered this one is s). it's made out of a fairly thick and warm material  yet the neck area of the dress is more exposed than it appears in pictures  especially in the back  making it awkward to have this very warm dress with neck  upper b
1,This top is very comfortable and really cute on. the material is super soft. i bought the white and am very happy with it  but it is a little sheer so i have to wear a cami with it. i would definitely recommend!
0,"Loved the idea of this top--but it just won't work for me. it's really big. i'm 5'3"" and 125 lbs. a small should be fine  but i'm swimming in this. the back is pretty (i tried it on with a white cami)  but it looks very maternity on me. tried to order the xs  but it's sold out. too bad. was a cute idea. not too thin for summer."
0,I was so excited when i saw this dress! i love this color  and the poplin sleeves. i was so sad when i tried it on though  the back poofed out in such a weird and unflattering way. i think it is because there is a pleat high up in the back  but then it seems like it gets narrow again around the hips. strange. also the material is kind of stiff and seems poor quality. i do love the way the top and the sleeves look on me though  so i am actually considering keeping it and just making it into a top
-1,Just received these and they fit perfectly  but the panels are different shades of gray. the color is not consistent and it make them look bad. they are perfect otherwise  but sadly they are not wearable. i will be returning
0,"This is a nice dress made with high quality fabric. unfortunately i'll need to make a return as it was quite big. i bought this dress in an xs and it was too large all around. i am about 5'3"" and 112 lbs and would have taken the petite  but there were none available. i'm not sure the petite would have even been small enough. the dress was a bit too long for short ladies and definitely too large in the waist and the bust (i'm small on top). it's too bad a this was a cute  and versatile dress that"
-1,I love good  flowy blouses and like the over sized look  but this one didn't wow me. i thought the quality was just ok. it didn't flatter me. i almost liked it  but i didn't. i'm glad i tried it on  because looking at the pics online i thought i'd like it way more than i did. just not great.
0,I like how this jacket is very versatile. you can wear it to work  or play. it does have interesting detail on it  i kept it based on the price and those details. i have the olive color. the arms are a little tight.
-1,The dress is not the beautiful color in the picture...it is a very yellowish cream. the fabric is thick and does not  hang pretty. very disappointed. had to return it.
1,I absolutely love this sweater....it is perfect for fall
0,I ordered this in lime  which is one of my fave colors. the garment was loose and roomy  and had the designer used elastic anywhere on the waist  i would have been in love! the shoulders were only tight due to the lack of flexibility in the bottom - no elastic at the waist and no placket below the waist to increase the ease of mobility taking the garment on and off - so if i had to use the ladies' room  i had to plan ahead.     i took it on a trip and didn't have time to try on prior to leaving.
0,Loved the style  ordered my normal m- fit tts though i thought i would potentially taper the sides to make less boxy (with a larger bust and shoulders  boxiness is unflattering). the slight boxiness looked perfect with stretchy  fitted business slacks. midday  i held my ipad up to my chest and the velcro from the cover pulled an entire lychnis delicate threads. not just snagged- i had to gently separate the threads from velcro grip. needless to say  it pulled the threads out by at least 1/2 an i
1,This is a wonderful top! the fabric is soft and comfortable  with a beautiful drape. the pattern is very pretty  the curved hems are very flattering  and the top is versatile. it can be worn with shorts  as shown  or a skirt with a belt or pants. i have pilcro wide leg pants in orange  yellow and green  and this top looked amazing with all of them. a great little find!
-1,I usually wear a size medium in angel of the north but this was very small. i would need to have ordered a size large or xl to have it fit. pretty but returning.
1,This top is a very comfortable  very easy top to wear. it is perfect for laying with work clothes or styling a bit more casually for just wearing out and about. i ordered it in the light blue color and it is beautiful- very soft and feminine. the ruffle lays really well down the front  which i was concerned about because of how busty i am. i ordered a small and it fits just right. i think the knit back really helps with that. very nice!
1,Tried it on at the local store today  it is very pretty! i believe i runs large. i am usually a small  but they only had an xs and it fit perfectly. it is made of thick linen and has a lining.
0,Beautiful top but it didn't fit. i am small chested with wide shoulders  normally wear a xs or s - ordered the xs and it swallowed me.
1,I wore this dress to dinner right after my boyfriend proposed to me! it will be perfect to wear to any bridal event like a bridal shower  rehearsal dinner or engagement party. i ordered a size 0 and 2. the mock neck is a bit snug. there wasn't any difference really between a size 0 or 2 so i kept the size 0 since it fit better in the waist. it's beautifully made and feels like it will hold up well. it's casual but still interesting. it felt just a bit above my knees. a perfect length. i paired i
-1,"Well...this is ""on me"" as i saw this hanging in the store  but way off on my size which is xxs petite.    i looked too quickly and got a nice sa to order it for me.    both pieces are transparent - no opaque lining at all is inside. both pieces are made of fragile clingy materials. there is no ""flow "" just cling. the size is much too big so the resulting look is of two bad pieces hanging oddly without any real shape.    this may be the first time i really just not recommend a piece - at all. bes"
0,"I so wanted to love this dress. i bought it in a size 4 and in both petite and regular  as i'm kind of in between and have a long torso and short legs. anyway  i'm 5'5"" tall and 130 lbs. the regular fit my torso well  and length not was too bad. with heals it might have worked without hemming. here is where it all fell apart. while understand that only really expensive designer clothing can afford to seam a pattern perfectly  i felt that the dot seam in the front of the dress was in a bad place."
0,I ordered the xxs p  but the actual cardigan is a xs p.  i was bummed as the xxs p are sold out. well  it fits ok anyway. (115 lbs  30dd  26.5 in waist)  beautiful sweater but oh so itchy. i think wool should be listed first (like ingredients) it is really itchy. why i so torn. i want to keep it because it is nice  but it is itchy. i will have to try it with a long sleeve shirt underneath  i don't think i can hang with ah short sleeve or sleeveless. colors and pattern are warm neutral  not red.
0,"I'm a tunic lover so i'll usually take a chance on them. i""m 5'4'' and usu a size 8 or medium. i ordered a small instead of a usual medium since other reviewers said it runs small. this hits about mid thigh which is a good tunic length but the overall fit is oversized. it's more like a swimsuit cover up rather than a nice blouse. that's really the best way to sum it up. oversized swimsuit cover-up like top. i'm going to exchange it for an xs but i think even that's too large."
-1,This dress had so much potential but the horizontal knit ruined it. i tried on size xxs in grey since my usual petite xxs size was not available. the fabric was a good weight and dress was well constructed. however  the wide horizontal knit made the dress bulge out at places especially in the lower body thus made me look wide and bulky. i wish they had used a cable knit pattern which will make the dress drape much more nicely and more flattering.
-1,Wish i would have read the reviews before i purchased and wore two of these. washed as directed and same outcome as everyone else. basically unwearable unless i maybe use it for a nightshirt. the shrinkage lengthwise was ridiculous. glad i didn't buy every color like i had planned to do!
1,This dress is a lot of fun and would be great for a party or a wedding but unfortunately it didn't fit me right. i ordered a small since i usually wear a size 2 but the waist was just a little bit loose while the dress was too tight across the bust. this caused the dress to pull up in the front and make it look too high in the waist. i guess i'm just too busty for this dress. too bad because i really wanted it to work. it is a lovely dress.
-1,I am short and curvy and this shirt swallowed me. sleeves were especially long.
0,I wanted to love this skirt it was good quality  but the front is a loose flap that is exposing so i had to return it
1,I am wearing a medium in the photos  my measurements are 38-30-40 for reference.
1,I honestly just love the hanky panky brand. i know it sometimes feels a little extravagant to purchase their lingerie  but the quality  fit and style are so good that it is absolutely worth it. this piece is no exception. i don't normally purchase lingerie like this  but saw this chemise and decided to try it. just as the other pieces from this brand  it's comfortable and gorgeous- so high quality and classy. it's a great cut  the fabric is clearly lace  but beautifully done. and the feel is lov
1,Comfortable shorts. thinner fabric. pattern disguises underwear lines. love the exterior pockets  as i won't have to tuck them in when i zip up. as the previous reviewer said  the black and white pattern has blue accents. they're mid-rise and a longer length  which i appreciate.
1,Everything about this blouse is perfect - the color  the drape  the detail. so flattering and easy to wear. i just love it!
-1,The fabric and color are absolutely beautiful. the shape of the dress is strange - fitted and tight through the waist  and enormous everywhere else. it was not flattering.
-1,"As soon as i saw this dress online i loved it and ordered it! unfortunately it just didn't work for me  i tried it in a small  medium and large. for reference i'm 5'2""  145lbs  36d. the dress is really pretty in person  but i looked like a little girl in it. my daughter who is 4'9""  100lbs  34a  also tried it on and she too looked like a little girl in it. the material is beautiful along with the detail at the neckline  however the neckline is not open like in the picture  it's more pushed toget"
1,"This blouse is gorgeous. first of all  it's cotton! so  it is extremely comfortable. it isn't tighter in some areas more than others  but fits evenly throughout  which although a rarity  is wonderful. finally  a blouse that fits perfectly! i am 5'3"" and 108 pounds. i ordered the regular xs and it hits right at my hips. i have a longer torso  however  so although i am not tall  the petite would have been too short for me. it is beautifully made and the red is a beautiful crimson on white. grab th"
1,Ok  so this is true to size-- i recently had a baby (i gained a lot of weight)  am in the process of losing it and took the risk of buying a jumpsuit online. i am 5'3 with a long torso  short legs  and a big fat butt so buying pants (especially rompers) are almost impossible. lengthwise  this fits me like pants. the draping is so flattering and the color combination is splashy but not loud. i had to review this as soon as i realized it fit. i don't think i've ever been so happy with an retailer pu
1,"This sweater runs large and long in the arms. i am 5'5"" and often wear petite in pants but not tops. the medium petite is perfect  the sweater is a beautiful open gauge knit and will be great this fall/winter for work over a tank and nice pants. the blue color is more of a mint green/blue  very pretty and different than anything i have in my closet. great addition."
-1,The dress is pretty  i ordered a 4 and 6 not knowing how it ran  i took both back the neck is too tight!
0,"Despite other reviewers comments on size - i really wanted this one to work so i ordered it. i'm typically a size xs and d chest and instead i ordered a small. the body of the sit for well but the cups of the suit i'd said for more for a b. (if i lifted my arms i would literally come out of it) a final comment on this suit - it looked like there were these little sticky spots all over the suit like stickers had been removed. it was reticketed and it didn't really feel ""brand new"" when it arrived"
1,The material is so soft and i really like the design (i got the map one). as others mentioned  sleeves are quite short  almost morel like a muscle tee than a t-shirt  but i don't mind. looks really cute under a cardigan for fall too.
0,This dress is sort of a mixed-media dress. the top colored portion is a slinky knit that dolan uses all the time. i like it a lot. the bottom  is a tight silky twill-like weave. the silhouette is straight  which is what attracted me to it  but when i put it on  i realized that the waist wasn't going to work for me. the split came at a point too high for me to belt and the sleeves made my wide shoulders look dowdy. i am not a person that wants to put on a dress and have to style the heck out of i
-1,The dress is too loose and runs too big
-1,I love the material on these shorts. unfortunately  that's all i love. the fit is awkward and i'm an easy fit. they're boxy in the body / legs and a bit tight in the waist  causing me to not be sure whether to place the elastic waist higher or lower and neither one works well. sadly  couldn't keep these just for the pretty fabric.
0,I have to agree with people who are saying this dress runs small in the hips. even a size 0 is typically roomy on me when it comes to dresses at retailer  but a size 4 in this would have been best on my hips. the size 2 was just a smidge too tight looking and loose on the upper half of my body  which made my waist look thicker than it is  i thought. my boyfriend disagreed and thought it looked nice  but i still didn't buy because my life would not give me many opportunities to wear this thing anyw
0,I wanted to wear this for my journey to cuncun and i wanted the blight pink as photo however it was a dark pink which didn't fit to me unfortunately... but the design was pretty!
0,I was excited to receive this top and wanted to love it; however  the side ruffles flared out more than i expected. it didn't look right on me so had to return it :(
0,"So bummed... i ordered this in the raspberry color then actually saw it in a store before it arrived to my house  so i tried it on. while i agree with the other reviews  it runs big in some areas  something about the neckline just wasn't right on me. it seemed to ride up higher and wasn't what i wanted. also  the ""raspberry"" color is almost more of a burnt orange. when i think of raspberry  i think of pink or red  this was neither of those. the top itself is cute though and super comfy. if it we"
-1,Was very surprised when i opened the package  this dress is very thin fabric and you need to wear a half slip as it is see through. the top of the dress is short to the draw string and does not drape bloused style at all. i have a short waist length so it should have worked. the color is a little darker than pictured  but over all looks cheap so full price with tax makes it way over priced. going back asap.
0,I expected this dress to be a much better fit and quality overall--the size small fit me fine--i'm about 140 and small in the chest  but the zipper was incredibly cheap and the dress could've draped in a more attractive way. if this dress could be in cotton and given more consideration to the fit and drape  it'd be worth it  but it's going back.
0,This was my favorite item in the august catalog & i knew i had to have it. my store had not received it yet so i ordered online. after reading the other reviews  i sized down and the fit is still much too large as this top has way too much material. this is coming from someone who loves swing tees and can appreciate a loose fit. however  this top hangs like a tent. also  the elastic around the bottom of the sleeves is quite uncomfortable. i do think the top is pretty and recommend only if you ar
1,These are called jeans but they aren't exactly jean material. they are black with a nice stretch to the fabric. a bit tighter on the thighs than the flare jeans but the stretch to the fabric makes it work. i like these very much  a very slimming effect. mid rise- which looks very chic.highly recommend!
-1,Tried this twice in yellow because for the price it seems like it would be such a useful piece  but the quality is below average for an retailer dress. it's just a shapeless  thin  beach cover-up that i could've picked up anywhere. the yellow color is so cute though. if you're looking for a light  breezy  go-to-the-beach dress that you can shove in a bag with your towel  this might be good for you  but it's too thin for just about anything else.
1,The colors and design are stunning in person. it is one-size and as most kimonos go it is billowy and flowing  and not fitted. i plan to wear it with a pair of black shorts and also with black leggings. i love the idea of layering this over shorts. i have a similar kimono and wear it as a bating suit cover-up. the long kimono over short looks fresh and modern and gives you the option to have some coverage when you want it. also  really pops over simple black leggings and black top. it's light an
-1,3 tags sewn in  2 small (about 1'' long) and 1 huge (about 2'' x 3''). very itchy so i cut them out. then the thread left behind was plasticy and even more itchy! how can you make an intimates item with such itchy tags? not comfortable at all! also - i love bralettes and wear them all the time including to work. i am a b cup. however  this one is so thin and flimsy that it gives no support even to a b cup - so for me this would only be a lounging bralette - if it wasn't so itchy!
-1,The top ran too large and it made me look more bustier than i am and rounder in my midsection by how it fell on me. maybe would've been better for someone with a smaller bust. the quality of the fabric was just okay.
1,This vest is adorable! i love the color  it goes well with almost anything. the drawstrings work great  some days i cinch them a little tighter for a more fitted look. honestly  i wear it at least once a week - out with friends or even to my job as a nanny. i was a little worried about the length of it because i'm tall  but it works perfectly with my build.
1,I have worn this dress twice and it is amazing. the material feels heavy and drapey but i still feel nice and cool in it. i always have several people asking me where i bought it when i wear it. i am 5'1 130 lbs and 34 d. i bought a small petite and it fit perfectly. i love this dress and would highly recommend it to anyone. definitely one of the best things i've ever bought from retailer.
0,"1. the wide leg/crop is a cool trend. but not great on me. i'm pretty standard in size/build: 5'6""  135 lbs   size 4. i felt like i just looked oddly shaped with them on.  2. and maybe this is the issue: the size 27 (my normal size in every citizen pant i own) was about 2 whole sizes too big for me. i mean  i felt great about myself. but...wowza.  3. when i took them to the store to try on/exchange  they don't even carry them in the store! so i just returned and will try something else."
-1,This coat is awful  just awful. i bought it based on the reviews  my husband said it looks like i am wearing a mattress. it looked awful. i really really liked the softness and that it wasn't like another puffer coat  it was also stretchy and the buttons super easy to wear  but the look  style  and design make it very unflattering. it looked so bad that i took it off right away. so disappointing!
1,"I'm a little on the fence about this dress. it doesn't do much for my fairly straight/petite body type; i.e. it's not fitted at the waist which i think would help even though i don't have much of a waist to begin with. but the low v-neck is flattering and the flared skirt is too. it's just that it probably looks better on an hourglass shape... i was fine with the fabric type  i'd describe it as a mid-weight ribbed knit blend. i'd say it's true to size  i got my usual xspetite and i'm 34aa  26"" "
1,This is a charming dress  with lots of quality touches  and something which is easy to wear and appropriate for many occasions. however  the dress i received wasn't quite like the dress pictured in the catalog and main website photos. the bottom buttons of the over-dress do not have matching holes  so you can't button it. this makes the v lower  and the bodice looser. it is like the photo with the brunette model on the website  rather than the primary photos with the blonde lady. personally  i w
-1,"It's a fine dress  but it definitely runs small  and it's actually a lot shorter than i was expecting  especially since i'm only 5' 3"""
0,This dress is very pretty in person. it fits true to size and is very figure flattering. one other reviewer mentioned it is a bit low cut  but i think that can be resolved by wearing a cami underneath to cover cleavage. my only gripe with this dress is that it's a little rough and stiff feeling. i am really sensitive to that and only buy things that are velvety soft. it probably works for most people but not for me  so had to go back.
-1,This top is well made and would be cute but huge. this top has no shape and is way big. back this goes.j
1,"I usually wear a 4 in maeve  and purchased this is a 6 in the orange. i'm just over 5'7""  34c  size 26/27 jeans. through the bust and arms the 6 fits great. i still found the front to be just a tad shorter than i am comfortable. it hangs well  though  if not a bit loose. definitely more billowy and boxy feeling in person. i think if it were slightly fitted through the waist  the length wouldn't be an issue. and it isn't even that much of an issue  but i did knock off a star for that reason. i bo"
0,I love these overalls  but they run very small?i had to return and reorder.
-1,The shirt does have a weird yellow tinge as other reviewers have described. i could get over that if the shirt was a flattering fit which it was not. not worth the money so i returned it.
-1,I wanted to love this sweater. the photo of the model makes it look so soft and warm. i liked the heavy texture and the extra long sleeves. however  after receiving this sweater i tried it on for less than 1 minute. one look in the mirror was enough to make me take it off and return it asap. the knit quickly expanding from small to large right over the bust  combined with the boxy shape was an atrocious combo. it must have added 30lbs to my physique and made my bust look matronly. yikes! this ma

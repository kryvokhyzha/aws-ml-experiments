1,This is a very pretty blouse. the fabric is lightweight and very soft. i read the other reviews and this does run very small  i ordered two sizes larger than i normally would and it fits very nicely.
0,I ordered this top in red based on one of the reviews. it is more like marroon. i am very disappointed. the top itself is plain cotton and not that great quality. it is long and has the belt at the back  but the fit and quality overall are very plain. it looks a tad dowdy. i am still keeping it because i got it on sale and i can wear it at home with lounge leggings. but it is definitely not dressy. perhaps white may not look as bad. the plain design and marroon dull color don't help.
-1,The pattern and fabric are lovely  but the sleeves are short (unlike the photo) so it drapes very strangely. i personally could not figure out how to wear it so that it looked anything remotely like the photo. had to return this one.
0,"Loved the fabric but returning because the armholes are cut waaaaay too low. unless you have 30"" arms  all you get is an unnecessary showing of your bra"
0,Sooo this adorable blouse is indeed different than pictured. no ruffle  such a bummer  sleeves are much longer  and yes it's teared in the front and back. also the button opening on the back is much longer/larger  in my opinion. i'll most likely keep it  but consider the mentioned if buying.
-1,The quality of the fabric is good  but the fit is horrible. unflattering and strange. definitely a pass.
1,"These shorts are perfect. not too short  but can be cuffed so not too long either. the fabric is soft and gets even softer after washing. bought two colors in the late spring and then recently added to my ""hyphen"" shorts collection. you can dress them up or pair with a casual t and flip flops. note - if you like your shorts loose  order true to size. they do stretch at the waist  so if you want them to fit true to size  order one-two sizes down."
1,This dress is gorgeous in person  soft and wonderfully comfortable with two large pockets. it also comes with a cotton knit slip for added swing. i bought at size 6 which was two sizes smaller than my normal size 10 in retailer dresses. i have worn twice and each time 2 random strangers have complimented it. it dry cleaned beautifully and it is really fun to wear. the model is shows the neck wide open but it is very cute tied in a little bow. expensive maybe  but well worth it.
-1,Very disappointed. ordered two sizes  the fraying of the embroidery was so bad on one of the dresses i wouldn't have worn it and the zipper was sticking. the second dress had fraying and loose threads as well and the seams at the shoulders were not properly sewn which made the lace at the neckline completely crooked. some of these issues would maybe be acceptable if the dress was under $100 but at $228 they are not. returning both sizes.
-1,I was really excited about this dress- the style looked like it would be a spring/summer staple in my retailer-heavy wardrobe. i was really surprised when i received it in the mail. the dress is quite thin cotton fabric and feels cheaply made. for the price  i could purchase a much higher quality dress elsewhere that would hold up better. i've been an retailer fan for more than an decade  but this trend of higher prices for lower quality is disappointing and insirpring me to leave a review for the f
-1,I really wanted to love this piece but it was very large. i'm 5'2 and ordered xs/s and i have return due to size.
-1,Ugh  the fit of this dress is terrible :/ what a beautiful dress though -- the material and the colors -- had so much potential. but  the fit is awful -- i ordered by regular size and the top was more or less ok  if not a tad big  but hip down was crazy tight that i couldn't even zip it without a ton of effort. i don't think sizing up will help because then the top will be even bigger. disappointing.
0,"My review of the pros : 1) quality made  not see through in any way  can wear with small bra straps 2) lace gives the top a 'different look""  really liked it. my review of the cons  which made me return the top 1) runs huge!!! i am 5'2""  36 small c  broad shoulders and my usual size medium looked like an xl. it was large in the bust area and almost 'puckered' at the armpits? i would probably order 2 sizes down to an xs  which i never wear in any size top. 2) for petite gals (i am 5'2"")  this a a"
-1,This simple lace top is beautiful and easy to wear  but do not wash it. the hem completely fell apart for me!
1,"This sweater is so lovely.. i like the fact that it's not super heavy  so you can be comfortable with a layer under it. the embroidery is beautiful. i usually get petite sizes when available  but the petite m was sold out when i purchased. i went with regular medium and am actually glad. it's not overwhelming or too long (i'm 5'2"").. in my opinion. if you're on the fence  go for it. totally worth it.."
1,This sweater/coat is great. it super comfortable. it's perfect for my california winters! it could be layered for colder areas. this piece definitely runs large- like really large. i went with an xs instead of my usual small or medium. it is meant to be boxy  and still is but sizing down allowed for it to be more flattering. i'd definitely say go in store and try it on  you'll love it!
1,This is a beautiful top  however  my top did not match the one in the picture  it's so odd  the stripes are completely different  it's ok  because it's very pretty  but i do like the one pictured better. it's too short on me for leggings and boots  but it's great with skinny jeans. very pretty and soft material.
0,These are great for summer except you need to size down! unless the pair i received was an anomaly  these run very large!
1,Ordered this online and thought it was more of a red than the true orange that it is
1,"I am 5'8"" size 4-6 us. i could barely zip the inside bra on the 8. i wear 34 b. i think it is uk sizing. i kept the 8 ( had to return the 6). it's a beautiful dress but it is a lot of dress. maybe too much for someone more petite. it looks ridiculous until you put the belt on:)"
-1,The black band seemed to cut across the widest part of my hips  emphasizing them. the pants are sheer. the fabric was not comfortable against my skin. overall  the pants were a miss.
1,Cute jacket  but size didn't work on me. 5'4  135 lbs. normally order s or xs in tops  but m in jackets. ordered the medium  but way too long everywhere. i can get by with regular a lot in retailer  but definitely ordering the petite to see if any better. not sure it will be enough though as arms were quite long.
0,I really wanted this to work. alas  it had a strange fit for me. the straps would not stay up  and it had a weird fit under the breast. it worked standing up  but the minute i sat down it fell off my shoulders. the fabric was beautiful! and i loved that it had pockets.
1,I agree with the other reviewer  this skirt is has beautiful print combed cotton with a sheen. it is kind of stiff with a little give  a perfect a line. the waist is a little tight so i sized up  usually wear a 2 and the 4 was perfect for me. wore it to a show last night and was super comfortable and pretty all in one.
0,Maybe if i sized down to a small i'd like them better.. they look ok from the front. but it seems like the leg was cut way too wide. there is exceess material in the back and leg hole. they are not all flattering to my rear end. overall kind of shapeless and the fabric is prone too wrinkling. too expensive (with the added shipping fee for an online exclusive) for the lack of structure and simplicity.
0,That was the only color i liked. it's great if you have a tummy like me and is long enough in the back to cover your butt. back detail is cute  but annoying. sometimes it shifts around and my bra shows  and the string is at least 3 feet too long.   not bad  i wear it with white gauze pants  looks nice. good with leggings too.
0,This dress is so cute and so flattering. i loved the shape  but i wore it wonce and the fabric was pulling on everything! just holding a purse while walking managed to pull out a ton of the fabric! when you spend so much money on something you think the quality would be better..
0,I ordered this dress in pm and it was very tight in the top. also  the dress is lovely but the undertones are very gray colored and did not go well with my skin/coloring. it had to go back but others may love it (i have dark hair/olive skin). it also ran a small on top (i'm 38 d). there should be a pm available soon lol
-1,I really love the pattern and the look on the model  and i thought i would love it. i ordered online  so i did not try on in store. when i tried it on  it has way too much fabric around the waist and skirt. it is thick fabric as well  and has a lining  and the waist has extra fabric for the design  and it has pockets  so it all adds up to be way too bulky. it is not flattering at all and made me look 10 pounds heavier. i am returning this dress. sad  because it looks so lovely on the model. i am
1,This body suit is super flattering and super comfortable. i'll probably order it in the other color.
0,"I have to confess i had very high hopes for this dress. i was buying it as a stylish  modern alternative to a business suit. i wanted this dress to work as a piece to deliver presentations in or attend faculty functions. tailored  conservative  and edgy at the same time. several hundred dollars dress should meet the aforementioned needs  i thought. but it did not. the best description for the dress is ""blah""  average.  the material is textures and crinkly  not slick. the top is cream/ivory color"
1,"Ok  so this is adorable. i am 5'3"" and medium size and had to take this to my alterations people because i loved it so much but it fit awkwardly. the back was too long and hung funny on my short body. after it was reworked  it is the cutest thing i own. they also made the little belt tighter across my waist. it is super versatile. my alterations people ran out and bought themselves one after they saw mine. so---- if you are not a toothpick or tall know it can be amazing with a little attention."
-1,"So i really loved this dress. i am tall (6ft) and the size 8 was perfect length. i would have worn it with flat dressy sandals. i would say it is true to size. i am not a flowy dress kind of girl but this was just the perfect amount of ""flow"" without making me feel like i was wearing a long potato sack. the back is just gorgeous and unique. here is why i couldn't make it mine. the tube top part is completely detachable and extremely thin. there is literally not much to it and i'm not sure it wou"
0,This top is very sweet and looks lovely on the model. it was not flattering for my larger bust  with the inverted pleat opening at my bustline and spreading out over my waist. the quality is nice  the fit in the shoulders is snug. the length is a bit short for me  but it may lay better on a different body type.
0,The sizing and length are great had it not been for my chest area. i sized up from my usual medium but the pleats create a maternity look for me unfortunately. it truly is a great tank top!
-1,I ordered an xxs petite and this hangs like a bag on me. i'm usually fine with the petite sizing  but this didn't work and i'm so bummed. the dress is soft  the blue color is gorgeous  but it fits like a bag. i wanted to love this  but sadly will have to return. i think someone with curves will love this dress. it is really beautiful quality  just does not fit a petite frame.
-1,This top was supposed to be 23 1/4 inches long in petite. it's actually 28 1/2 inches long.  it's also large in width. hard to believe it's an extra small petite.
0,I bought this thinking it would be a great summer tunic  but it was really huge on me. i normally wear a medium but ordered down a size and it was still quite large. it was very long as well and i am 6' tall. i am normally a size 8  to give you an idea. i would recommend it  but it is going back for me.
1,And runs large. i'm always a size 8 in dresses and the 8 was too big. i would buy it in a 6 if the color was closer to what i'm seeing online.
1,I ordered this in the lavender and love the rich color! looks great with my blonde hair. the bell sleeves  which are all the rage right now  add to the feminine look. i wore it with jeans and espadrilles for a fab boho look!
1,Love this tank. it is so soft and comfortable. the length hits just right on the hip. it hugs the body nicely  not too tight  just loose enough on a hot summer day. i have this in black and white. i wish they would offer more colors.
-1,I bought both colors based on the reviews and really like the prints. however  they are too sheer. i don't want to wear a tank top  but you have to with these tops since they are so sheer. i can also see the fabric tearing easily  it is too delicate. i sent both colors back. what a waste because the prints and colors are good. these tops are also not for busty ladies. i have a big bust  and the top part didn't cover my entire bust and was awkward because the division between the fabrics would st
-1,"I ordered this in a 4 (34b  140lbs.  5'8"") because it looked like it would run big  and it definitely does! the 4 fit comfortably but the cut of this dress made me look about 10 lbs. heavier than i am. i am pear-shaped and this dress made me look very bottom heavy  so i returned it. that said  the material is gorgeous!  as it is the perfect weight and the colors are much more striking and complementary in person. if i had a straight(er) silhouette and a larger bust  this dress would have been a"
1,The colors of this top are my favorite part  i want to hold onto summer for as long as possible and this time lets me do that!
0,The wine color is beautiful  and the idea of a knot front with different back is a good one. however  both fabrics are thin  and the back is quite see through. the knit shows every single bodily imperfection. so  if you are the quintessential tall and thin  and you don't mind showing your bra  go for it! otherwise  i suggest skipping this one.
1,I'm 5'1 and 110 pounds and i ordered the 26 petite. the jeans are fabulous...flattering....comfortable...i could go on and on. the fabric is super soft and the fit hugs in all the right places. it is a nice flare bottom. i will have to wear these with heels or wedges  they are too long for flats.
-1,Retailer has incredible service  and so they let me return this dress even after having worn it. however  this dress cannot be cleaned. i saw a stain on it after the first use  so i first tried hand washing it. however  the black part of the dress came off on the white part  making the stain worse. i then tried dry cleaning it (the care tag allows both) and that produced 3 or 4 new stains where the black rubbed off on the white. it's a beautiful  striking dress (that would be great maternit
0,I fell in love instantly...but...upon looking in the mirror  it is 100 percent see through. at least the black is... i love it enough that i am going to try to put a cami underneath. however  that mayn't work. the shirt is lovely in and of itself  but at 48  i don't need a see through shirt. it is also defiantly about a size larger that expected. so size down. almost so good!
1,This piece is gorgeous in person. it is more of a broen than taupe and goes with everything... it is more of a coat than a sweater. i bought one for my mom  and picked one up for myself when it went on sale. it is moms favorite piece among her extensive retailer collection.
1,Really cute and comfy and casual skirt. i am looking forward to travelling in this skirt and running around for the summer. i did size down one size. highly recommend. will get lots of wear.
-1,Loved this shirt when i saw the picture. unfortunately fit was not what it needed to be to keep it. you can't really see in the photo but if you have any chest at all (i am only 34b...so would say of average size bust) this shirt will not fit well. there is a seam in the bust area that cuts across the bust which is not flattering/doesn't fit well . the sleeves were also a bit more tight than i'd have thought from the photo.  really wanted to love this - but unless you have a smaller chest it lik
0,I wanted to love these because they are so pretty and come in lots of colors  but after only a few minutes of wearing them  i was having to pull them out of my bottom! why does women's underwear so frequently ride up? i normally wear a size 4/28  and ordered these in a m  but i guess they were still too small  which seems unreasonable to me. they are soft and pretty  but i will not be ordering more.
0,This dress is beautiful. the fabric is light weight but textured and interesting  and the purple is gorgeous. the soft pink was a bit more orange than i expected  but not a deal breaker. the problem i had with the dress was fit around the arms. i sized up and was glad that i did because it runs small up top  but because the straps come in a bit around the arm holes  it creates armpit fat  which is not a problem i usually have. i could wear the dress with a sweater  but you wouldn't be able to se
0,I love the feel and quality of these pants  however  they ran super big! they would not stay up around my waist  unfortunately.
1,This skirt is stunning but i really wish it was cotton canvas - maybe by summer retailer could make one?
0,"This spandex top  in my opinion  is workout wear. it is not the tank i expected to receive  but my bad. it is super stretchy tank like most folks use with leggings or workout shorts. it does seem small but perhaps due to the kind of tank it is  it should fit like this. 5' 5"" 142 lbs medium is skin tight. color is nice but  as i wanted a tank to wear with skirts or jeans and this is not what i had envisioned-it has to go back to retailer. quality seems fair."
1,These have an amazing fit! i have them in three colors. they are not too low rise  they are not too high. they are the perfect length. the only thing i do not like is the rolled cuff is not stitched and comes down easily if you do not iron down.
1,Beautiful top... the print is really unique and already received compliments on it when running my daughter in for school. it's a little fuller on the bottom and flows out so i think i may pin it but it's beautiful. definitely worth getting!
0,I loved almost everything about this skirt. thick and lined and love the buttons. comfortable. the only problem was that the two sides flared out at the bottom  presumably from the buttons. i was torn  but in the end it just looked too silly and it was sent back.
1,This top is amazing. so soft and the off the shoulder part stays where it belongs. i'm usually a large but got this in a med. fits perfectly.
1,This jacket is beautiful in colors and warm enough to wear in the fall or layer it with a sweater in the winter. it is more taylored at the bottom at the legs and would be great with leggings or jeans. i originally ordered a large but found myself swimming in it so happy it was still available in medium so i re-ordered it. definitely order it in a size smaller. sadly it was after the sale had ended but great customer service they issued it for me at the price i originally paid. (ps i'm 8 months
0,"Cloth and stone has been getting a little shotty lately in terms of quality. they used to be a pretty consistently high-quality brand  but lately i've been left a little bummed. i got this in ""yellow"" which is really a muddy orangey color. i think i would have gotten over the less desirable color if the fabric were better  but it is actually two very thin layers of fabric that are stacked and snag easily (sort of like a soft cheesecloth). the shirt is definitely comfortable and cute  but the qua"
-1,I'm a short girl  but i usually wear tops in a small or medium at retailer. for me  i would have needed this shirt in a size at least one notch smaller than even offered. this shirt is adorable. love the details. i wanted it so bad  which is why i paid so much for a basic t-shirt. still  it was large to the point of frumpiness and could have used some sort of scoop or v-neck to break up the dots.
-1,I wear med or large in most items. the medium was huge. fit like a moo moo. size down by at least two.
-1,"I have a holding horses dress similar to this one from about a year ago.  i loved the swinging fit without it looking like a maternity dress.   the fit and style of this dress is wonderful  it's the color that killed it for me.   i ordered the ""orange"" because i liked the photo on the model.  when the dress arrived in the mail  i could hardly take it out of the package and try it on.   the color is almost neon orange.   too much for this redhead.  hard to wear that bright neony color.  not sure"
-1,As the other reviewer said  the skirt had this weird bunching on both sides of the hips-it was ridiculous. i don't know how anyone could wear it-looks like you had two little triangle things poking out from each hip. i'm long and lean so usually skirts like this fit me well. very very strangely constructed-i couldn't keep it even at the deeply discounted price
0,This dress is lovely fabric  generaly nicely tailored  but weirdly large around armholes  which gap. i'm sending it back. also this 'red' is more like a fuschia.   dress was generally a a bit too big on top  oddly both too long in the torso  and the shoulders cut too far in--they didn't cover bra straps--as well as unattractively large armholes. you can even see it on the model. i i'm a size 10 to 12  fairly busty but not extremely  and with a slightly short torso  which is party the problem (th
-1,"I purchased this dress in the green  and while the print and material were lovely  the extra folds in the neckline made the dress look frumpy up top. the billowly bottom made it look like a bag. i am 5ft  36d and 29"" waist and the size 2 fit  which makes me think this runs large! i'll be returning this dress."
-1,Don't get me wrong  this is probably cute on someone else  but not me. i looked in the mirror and just laughed  it was that bad. so if you're considering getting this  size down. ordered mine in large and it looks like i'm wearing a barrel. the pink is pretty but the horizontal striping did nothing for my shape. the fabric is soft. i'm just over trying peplums.
-1,I liked the design and the shirt did fit well enough  but the thin fabric does not justify the price. it looks like it will get holes in it after a wash or two.
0,Not good for for an hourglass shape. lots and lots of pretty fabric  but the waist hits just where the hips widen--very bohemian (just no good for a figure 8). the sizing is generous. with both elastic and a zipper  there's room to go small if between sizes  be aware: the plunge at the front is wide and dramatic. i dropped the hangar in the dressing room and had to clutch fabric close to my reasonably-modest c-cup so as not to spill out. would perhaps work on a very narrow person who's completel

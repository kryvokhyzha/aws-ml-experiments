-1,This dress was a disappointment. not black  but brown. and it was very oddly made  with a weird  seam right across the belly. on its way back...
1,I love this dress! i was actually able to fit in a l versus my usual xl due to the style of the dress. a bigger chest person (i'm a d) may not find the dress as well fitting as i do. overall great fit can easily dress it warm with a scarf  boots  hat or best. a great dress for fall-spring
1,"We were at dinner in provence at sunset... and in walked a young lady wearing this lavender? dusty blue? lilac? creation- just swingy enough to be perfectly comfortable  yet lacy enough to be elegant. the color struck me as ""south-of-france"". they were american by accent. i was too shy to ask the brand of her dress  but knew by the powers of the internet that this dress would one day be mine. magnolia lace dress- i found you!!!"
0,"This is one of those dresses that is just ""nice"" and can be one that you go to in a pinch.... it flows very nicely and you can dress it up and down. it's not the best quality in fabric...but if it was all silk you would have paid 3xs. i like it  it fits well...it's not outstanding or unusual. i think it is a bit pricey for what you get...but  it's a ""work horse"" dress...it will do you right whenever you need it to!"
0,The shirt design is very nice  but it fits very loose. it will not look good if you are heavier as this shirt will make you look wider because of the baggy fit. the sleeves though are fitted and feel a little tight. the material of the sleeves also is very itchy and feels like some wool material.
1,This is a gorgeous piece of clothing - true to size  simple yet flattering lines  very comfortable. it has such flattering little touches as well  such as the detail work on the sleeves. love it  love it  love it! i just wish it were machine washable!!
0,The colors are beautiful and the fabric is very soft and comfortable. i will be returning because of issues with length and being low cut.    for reference i am 5'5 145lbs  38-30-40  34ddd. the dress was low cut and showed too much cleavage for my comfort  but this may not be an issue for women with smaller breasts (or if you don't mind some cleavage showing). this length was also a bit too long  so if you are 5'5 or shorter you may want to order the petite size.
-1,This top is beautiful in design  but sadly  i will be returning. it is hand wash  and even after doing so  i had 2 unraveled threads resulting in large holes. unfortunate since it was so flattering before washing.
0,These are beautiful pants  especially when you walk  they are simply beautiful and flow nicely. however  they are soooo very long (i am 5 5 1/2) and even with a big wedge's i would have to get these altered. the waist seemed very small  i am a sz 12 (10 in some stores) and i got the large and it was way too tight in the waist and have no stretch or give at all. . probably a sz 10 at most. so unfortunetly they have to go back.
-1,I saw this dress online  and i thought it was perfectly cute! however  once i tried it on at home  it just didn't work. one of the buttons broke in half as i tried unbuttoning  and once i got it on  the dress was so small that the cuffs cut off circulation to my forearm. (i'm 5'7'' and ~126 lbs and purchased in size 2). i didn't even try buttoning all the way. i took it back  and i don't even think i want a larger size. the buttons are just too fragile.
0,"I ordered this in a petite small; a petite xs would have fit too. fits just like on the model. i'm 5'2""  currently 33-25-37ish with narrow shoulders and torso. the regular size proportions would have been off on me. lovely pattern on a milky white background.  .  i'm returning it because it feels so scratchy  much more than a linen tee i got from retailer a few years ago and that i love  especially in hot weather. with this one i would also need to wear a cami under it  as even my nude bra showed"
1,These leggings are beautiful and different. the material is very stretchy  sort of a spandex feel. panty lines definitely show in the back. i found they run true to size; i wear a size 6/medium/28 in pants or jeans and the size medium fit me great.
0,Bought it on sale and i am keeping it. it is well made an the material seems to be of good quality. however  i believe this would be more flattering on someone less curvy - less hips  smaller bust - as it makes me look slightly pregnant. still  i am keeping it to use on those days i just don't feel like dressing up for work. i bought a large (i'm a 36-38c)  but i think i could've gotten away with a medium.
1,"I purchased this dress in the berry color. it is beautiful and feminine. the length fit just like in the picture. i love all the detail and ease of this dress. i'm 5'2"" 34d and purchased a size 2. it fits true to size."
0,"I am a sweater girl  so i was really looking forward to this cozy-looking piece. like other reviewers  i found the fit to be very strange and not as pictured. i am 5'1"" and 107 lbs and typically wear xxsp or xsp. i ordered this in the xxsp because of the loose fit. it did not fit like the model at all. the sleeves were shorter and stuck out oddly. the length was not as long as pictured  but it would have been fine for me had the sweater not also been as wide as it was long. others suggested sizi"
-1,This is so close to perfect  but there's a seam down the middle of the back and they didn't bother to match the polka dots. you can see the mismatch in the second photo. i was about to buy the jacket  and totally in love  when i turned and saw the error. i hoped it was one bad match  but nope  on every one. couldn't unsee  didn't buy. very disappointed.
-1,Very disappointed the back of this blouse is plain  not as displayed.
1,I saw this dress online and b-lined it to the store to try on. it is a beautifully made dress. lots of great detail with stitching and beading on the front placket. feels very boho and chic. i have received lots of compliments while wearing this dress. i was almost turned off by the price  but decided to see it in person. worth every penny. wear it with sandals or tall boots  could have worn a medium  but a little tight for 38c on top.
0,The material is soft and the pattern is pretty  but it fits like a sack. it's too bad that this wasn't more form-fitting  with some stretch and a zipper  because its fit is just not beautiful. for tall  very slender ladies  this will be pretty  as it is in the photo. it fit me just fine (with a little extra room on top)  but it went right back into the bag without a thought.
0,Unfortunately this top looks billowy and boxy on my. i am tall and very slim and i look pregant in this one ;). maybe it works better on somebody more curvy.
1,Love this shirt  can dress up or more casual. wish i would of purchased all colors!
1,I love these shorts. i don't understand why they aren't sold out yet! they are buttery soft and fit great. i usually wear a size 26 and these are true to size. they are my go to run around shorts but because they are a dark wash so i feel like i can wear them out with a cute top to dinner even. love!!
-1,Quality is fantastic but i feel like a 14 would have barely made it's way around one leg! this pant is way small in terms of sizing and not a style fit for anyone over a 6. a lot of fabric in the legs. nice pant but not for this girl!
-1,The picture makes the shorts look structured. i assumed they were made of a heavier cotton material. i was disappointed when they turned out to be a light weight polyester.     also  this runs way too big. i am busty and did not fill out the top of the xs.    i wouldn't even buy this at the sale price.
0,"The dress is great for pear shapes. however  i do feel it runs larger than typical retailer sizing. ordered a small (5'8"" 140#) and i still think it may be a bit big. the material is very comfortable  not too thick or thin. however  i feel the shaping on the bottom is a little bulky due to the fabric. see the attached photo."
-1,Not great quality  runs a bit lose  disproportionate (too large in neck and arms area)
-1,Cut out design  no seems or hems.   very disappointed in retailer
-1,This skirt looked absolutely beautiful in store and took my breath away. i immediately headed to the fitting room to try it on  but was disappointed by the awkward ruching. if this skirt has removed that upper portion and kept a normal waistband (thereby also shortening it to knee length)  it would have been lovely. it should be noted that this is midi-length  which is awkward on me. i was unable to find a cute way to wear this which is disappointing since it could have been lovely.
0,...maybe i would've kept this top. i love the print  colors  and design. however  i feel like i had too much of a bosom to wear it. since my bust and torso seemed too large for it  the peplum ruffle bottom lining and top straps did not look good.
1,"I've been shopping with retailer over 10 years and this is my first review. i almost didn't order after reading negative reviews from petite ladies. i'm 5' 2"" and these jeans are perfection! they look amazing with a 2-3 inch heel. i don't think they are meant to wear with flats since petite people look ridiculous in flats with boot cut or wide leg anyway. love these!"
-1,The sweater is very comfy and looked good the first time i tried it on  however the material is thin and slightly see through. also  after one wear it completely stretched out and made the long sleeves awkward to wear without washing in between each wear. after the third time i wore it  i discovered a large hole in the armpit  most likely due to the excessive washing. i would not recommend this sweater.
1,I have several lilka pj bottoms and i'm glad to add these ones with the adorable bird print to my collection! tts  soft flannel  striking colors  only wish they had pockets!
0,This top is very pretty on the hanger. however  i have a curvy bust  and it was incredibly unflattering on my body. boxy  too high of a neckline  unattractive. the plus sides to it are that crochet detailing is lovely  and the color is nice as well. maybe if you have a 1920's frame it would work.
1,Great print and material  but this top runs large. i'm 36c and usually wear l in most lines retailer carries  but this was just big. i reordered in a medium.
-1,This top is beautiful - even more so in person. however  like a previous reviewer  the fit is very boxy. there is so much excess fabric that poofs out on the sides that you can't see in the photos due to the model's cardigan and arms. if this top had been a bit longer and more fitted  without all the excess fabric at the bottom  it would have been perfect. again  the color  the lace  the fabric and the pleating is all gorgeous. would love it if the designer took this into consideration and came
1,I had this on my birthday list and was really hopeful that it'd work out based on all of the good reviews. when i got it  i was happy with the fit and fabric  but i was stumped as to what i'd wear it with. it hung in the closet for a couple of weeks because i just didn't know if i could pull off the length. i took the plunge today and find it pairs nicely with a flared leg pant and simple shirt underneath. it's so stretchy  warm  and cozy! the sweater does shed as another reviewer mentioned so k
-1,The shape is awkward  too loose  not flattering. my body just disappears under all the fabric and the bird print wasn't as cute as online. returning this one.
-1,Well  the model looks great and i really like interesting unusual designs as it can be really unique for very long time. i tried and when i opened package it was funny looking tent with several beautiful buttons. fits like tent  long  huge  make me look like i am on military trials and i supposed to be some sort of target.
-1,I ordered this online and was disappointed when it arrived. it didn't look quite like it does in the photos online. it also runs small. i returned it because i did not feel it was worth the high price.
1,"Great material that drapes nicely. super comfy  feels cool but it's a thick material--not at all see through. so happy i purchased this. and super easy with the snap buttons  but the shirt is very well made and high-quality material. would look great on all sizes and shapes. i'm 5' 4"" and about 140  small chest. normally i'm a s or m with tops but bought this in a m because i like a slightly oversized shirt  though it's also made to be looser and longer. still  at 5' 4"" i'm not swimming in a m."
-1,Well  i wanted to love it and it was just too much. i think it is a bit wider and weirdly baggier than it should be. i also feel it should be fully lined. it was not. the exterior wool and pattern is very nice. maybe if it was lined  a smaller size would have worked better  but for the price  i needed more. i also would have liked some sort of option for tightening the waist a bit when zipped up. i realize this isn't in the picture  so no expectation  but upon trying it on and seeing its boxines
-1,There are darts that are not shown in this picture that make the dress ill fitted. not sure why they are not in the picture and on the dress. i wish the pictures shown were more accurate.
1,I bought this top in a small and it was true to size. loved that it wasn't too fitted across the back  but was still able to show a bit of body with the drawstring by the waist. it will become a wardrobe staple during the hot months in dallas.
0,"This is a beautiful coat nicely constructed and very warm. it was just too bulky for me and i looked 10 lbs heavier in it. i am 5'7"" and 140 lbs. maybe it would be better suited to a more slender frame."
1,The perfect simple black top. great fit - can be dressed up or down. closet staple!
-1,I thought i would love this shirt because it goes along with my style  but i returned it immediately. it runs so large! the colors are faded  and the trim of the shirt curl over  so it looks cheap and frumpy. i do not recommend this! it hits in all the wrong places.
0,Tried on this maxi dress recently  hoping i would have a new dress to enjoy but the frabic is just too thin. so sad :(. unfortunately it shows every lump and bump and even wearing spanx while trying on it still showed too much. a full length slip would help but i decided to put it back.
0,"I thought i was getting this nice light weight white sweater but not the case.  it is a pretty heavy  nice thick cotton and beautiful made. it does run large. i got the small and love the oversize feel even on my 5'9"" frame.   but - it is not white  it is beige  and it is not light weight. i have enough beige sweaters in this look so this one is going back  even though it was a great buy on sale."
1,It's simply a super cute and versatile jumpsuit. you can wear it as is or over a shirt or t-neck. drapes well  hangs well. looks good from the front and the back. i am 5-5  120 lb  size 4 fits perfectly. only drawback  has to be dry cleaned...
0,Wow was this top huge on me! i am usually a large  but lean towards xl when things don't have stretch. i sized up out of fear that my bust couldn't squeeze into a large (36dd) and i didn't want the buttons in the back to gape. when i took this out of the package (i purchased the blue) i knew right away it was way too big. looked like it could fit my husband. the sides poofed out so far  i looked ridiculous (if you look at the photos  the model is trying very hard to control the poofiness with he
0,I got this in the green color. it's a beautiful color  soft to the touch. i agree with other reviewers that it seems very delicate. i don't mind dry-cleaning my sweaters  so that's not the issue. the problem is that a. it runs huge - i got the small and it swims on me. i tend to run between small and medium in tops - very unusual to have a small be so big on me and b. the slits go even higher than they look on the model - they come up to the top of my waist. even with high-waisted pants  the sli
-1,Color is not like photo and fit doesn't work if you're busty
1,Love this as a lightweight coat for cool to cold days. i love the squishy soft feel of the material. it works well with sweaters. love the deep pockets which works with my iphone plus and wallet. i love how simple and practical this coat is. the hood when not used as a hood makes a nice collar for the neck and head.
-1,Large and the material is too bulky. i returned it.
-1,I loved the way this shirt looked when i tried it on in the store buto when i got home i realized it's extremely sheer. you can't wear a white bra with it  for example because it will show through. taking it back.
0,The shirt is quite beautiful  the lace is thick and high quality. however  i have a short-ish torso and hourglass figure and this shirt added 20 lbs. the peplum fabric below the waist hung awkwardly and poofed out. maybe this would work better for a taller person  or one who has a straighter build.
-1,I was minimally torn over whether to return this but ultimately it's going back because the knit is just too thin. i thought it would be cozy and be of normal sweater weight but it's not. and because it's so light  the swing effect doesn't really come off. nothing special.
1,Gorgeous colors  high quality. my only word of caution is that the top part is very tight. if you have a large chest (c+) this is going to be snug  or not fit at all. i'm wearing it now in pregnancy  but i think it will also look great post-partum. can be dressed up or down.
-1,"The color is a nice cool red and the material is very soft. but the dress left me feeling shapeless and the bell sleeve overtook it. i wanted to love it  but it just wasn't working for me. i'm 5'8"" and purchased a s. it fits true to size  however it was loose around the waist and just wasn't complimentary on me. this will have to go back."
1,Lucky enough to have the chance to try this on in the store! the sleeves are not big
0,This is the perfect day dress--loose fit  comfortable fabric. i usually wear a m or l in most dresses of this type  but the s actually was the best fit. i have worn it all summer and it's perfect for hot weather. just order smaller.
1,I was going to re-turn this.top  i was really on the fence.  so glad i didn't  it is.comfortable and easy to wear. lace is a little restrictive  but willing  to over look  it because i look so cute
0,Perfect summer pants until i wanted to pet my dog and they ripped first time wearing them.
-1,This sweater has the weirdest stitching  although the buttons on the sleeves are a nice touch and the hunter green color is to die...poor fit means poor sweater :)
1,I absolutely love the color  cut and style of this maxi. the high neck and drop waist are both so flattering! the color and design is gorgeous as you'd expect from rana gill. i got my normal size 8 and it was perfect. i would have expected the fabric to be a little heavier but it works as a late summer early fall dress
1,I love these jeans. they can be dressed up or dresses down. super cute with tall boots or loafers. i wear them all the time.
1,I do love sheath dresses and this one is very adorable!  true to size and nice length.  the black and white is kind of a throwback to the 60s flower power era and really cute.  nice weight so feels substantial not the flimsy wrinkly type material; more like a crepe.  very nice!
0,"I have to send the skirt back. i agree with other reviewers who say the slits are extremely high  the ""underskirt"" bunches and the fabric snags easily. additionally  the yarn was already fraying at the top of the slits  and the label was stitched on the outside of the waist band. disappointed in the quality of this skirt  given the pretty steep price."
0,"I love this skirt and wish i could keep it. but it is not for the vertically challenged. i am 5'0"" 130 lbs and the medium petite was about 4 in too long  even with wedges. my intent was to wear this with sandals so i have to return. boo."
1,I have not worn yet but excited to try it out soon with jeans and boots. comfy but has a nice sweater look...not too casual. sleeves are very long but don't think i want to downsize.
0,Gorgeous details great use of materials -- yet the diagonal seam above the knee at the quadriceps cuts off the muscle and looks odd if you are the least bit muscular.
0,This skirt looks exactly as pictured and fits great. i purchased it a few weeks ago and got lots of compliments on it. however  on the third wear  the side zipper split wide open. needless to say  it was returned.

0,"At 5'5"" (almost)  122lbs.  i always wear a size small. however this dress runs large (no  i am not smaller than i was 6 months ago) and it looked like a dumpy sack on me. too bad  i really wanted it to fit! it is a slightly heavier fabric than anticipated  and would be an excellent travel dress. i may try the xs. . ."
-1,The sweater runs large  the sweater is designed in such a way that it looks very sloppy. i would never be able to wear it out of the house. however  the material is exceptionally soft and delightful. keeping as its a great stay at home & lounge sweater  but way over priced for this purpose. if you can get the fabric to lay correctly  you're a genius.
1,After reading reviews  i ordered a medium instead of a large even though i am typically a size 12. it was definitely the right decision. a very flattering dress in a beautiful color. if you order in the right size  it is not at all dowdy. it is forgiving in the belly area  which is great for me. it can be worn with tights or without tights  so really quite versatile. i am sure that i will wear it a lot. also  it is very comfortable.
-1,The photo of the mila turtleneck where model has her hands to her sides  and just below her hair  there is a bit of extra fabric which falls to the bottom of the sweater in a bit of a pleat- well  it's not representative of the abundance of fabric in the xl. i usually wear an l or xl well with retailer clothing. the excess added the appearance of excessive pounds from breasts to bottom of sweater. bummer. i'll be returning it.
1,Nice tee  true red 3/4 sleeves  lacing is a nice touch. good quality and great sale price.
0,The fit is slightly loose  but figure flattering  the fabric is semi sheer and the light  coral color is very pretty. however  after one  short wear i discovered fabric torn from both sides of the back seam. unfortunately  i need to return this blouse asap.
1,The picture online doesn't do this pretty dress justice. i'm curvy  and always searching for dresses that don't make me look like a sack of potatoes. its pin tucks at the bust give it a little shape  and the print is much more vibrant in person. will look great with tights and a black blazer for dinners out.
0,I think this blouse would work for petites. it is super short and boxy. looked nothing like the fit on the model. sad to return it  love the print.
-1,I tried this on in the store and it was huge. i couldn't try on a smaller size because they only had a 2 and 4. i tried on my usual size 12. i don't think the embroidery is as pretty in person either. definitely not worth the price.
1,I own another pair of this brand and these are just as cute and fit the same. i wish the fabric was a bit nice but they still are super cute. they have wider leg holes which are flattering on my muscular build. nice and lightweight and sooooo comfy!
0,Bought this in the white. i found it to run narrow in the shoulders and tight in the biceps. i typically vacillate between a m and l  and because of the two aforementioned factors i went with the large  which means overall the shirt is very billowy on me in the chest area and hangs very long. ---------- the fabric is soft  and the weight of this shirt is season-less; always a plus. it is not sheer by any means  but if you have a tattoo (like i do) you will be able to see it. --------- quality is
1,Love this top (and every top tiny puts out).  runs very small.  i normally wear an xs but i got a m in this top.  so pretty and great detail
-1,They look nice on the page  but they didn't work on my body. made me look big and boxy. maybe if you're super-skinny  they'll be fine.
1,Love the way this tee looks and feels. so comfortable and fun! good length. perfect jeans tee.
-1,I wanted to like this dress  but it just did not work for a bustier frame. the fabric is quite loose  does not nip in at the waist and is not particularly clingy  so if you are well-endowed  your assets create a bit of a shelf from which the rest of the dress just hangs. as a result  the swing comes from the apex of your chest as opposed to from your hips (as on the model)  and the asymmetrical hemline makes the look even more awkward. on smaller curves  this would likely be very flattering  but
1,This dress hits all of the high notes for me. it is crisp  elegant  and it looks like something a european coutour designer would create. i am so glad i have this dress in my wrardrobe. it hits me just above the knee which is super flattering. wear this to a fancy party when you want to look feminine and classy. it is a dress that will serve you for a lifetime.
0,Beautiful thick sturdy denim. probably the best denim i own in terms of the material. the cut can be awkward as it can be tight across the thighs and hips and kinda makes my butt flat. however i love the wash and quality of the material and at a sales price  totally worth it.
0,Tried small and medium and both were quite tight on the bottom. top is perfect. will return the bottoms and try the large.
0,It breaks my heart to say this but i had to return for shape issues. i am not a fan of dolman sleeves (they make me look big and bulky) and i wished i would have known that prior to purchasing. it is unfortunate because it is a really beautiful knit and quality. i could see this working better on someone tall and thin.
1,Easy to wear  get lots of compliments when i wear it. can be dressed up or down
1,I have this in another color and it is my absolute fav! transform any outfit! it has an over-sized fit.
1,This dress is perfect. i'm literally wearing it right now. it's crazy comfortable while still being flattering. it looks and feels high quality  and just barely doesn't hit the floor. it makes me feel like a goddess. plenty of room in the bust area  even for me (36dd)  and doesn't show bra straps or underwear. highly recommended!
1,I am obsessed with this shirt! it's sooooo comfy and soft  like wearing a blanket! perfect for throwing over yoga clothes. comfy yet adorable.
-1,"Agree with previous reviewer. i am usually an xs p in this brand (5'3"" 115 lbs) but i could not get the internal slip over my head. the chest area was fitted (i am a 32b) but then the skirt was very full and loose. i could have cut out the slip  but worried it would be see through and just not worth it at full price."
-1,"I cannot imagine this dress working in any size. i am a small  thin and average height woman (usually a 25/26 in pants  a size 32c bust  and 5'6"" tall). this dress was huge. i sized down to a 2 ( i am always a 4 in dresses) and this dress was still big... i do not know if i could size down to a 0 though as the shoulders seemed to fit right. it was ginormous. i got it for a wedding in two months and i will be 3 months pregnant  it still wouldn't work unless i was 9 months pregnant and carrying tr"
0,Overall a very nice and unique dress. it does have too much going on  but can be worn in a versatile way  and if you are small chested  without a bra. i am not a big fan of the material  i wish it was softer. it definitely has a gypsie/bohemian look if that is what you are looking for!
0,Great color and quality but very boxy. even with the drawstring there is no shape going on here.
-1,I own many retailer dresses but the sizing can be odd. i usually wear a size 4-6 and i have a floreat maxi dress size 4 that works well. i am 34c and based on the reviews i decided to order a size 6. the dress fits well except for he bust area that is very snug/couldn't even get the zipper up. i will probably have to order a size 10 to be able to close the zipper on the bust area but it will be huge everywhere else.the fabric seems very delicate and may develop runs easily. it's a shame because th
1,I bought this cardigan in grey. it's sturdy  soft  great layering sweater over a top or even under a heavier sweater. the tail in back is long and unique. the shape is flattering. and for a lighter cardigan  it's more substantial than others out there. the sleeves are long enough for my long arms  which i love.
-1,This open cardigan runs really big and has way too much fabric. even going down a size i felt like i was swimming in it.
0,"Yes  this top is not of the best quality but i bought it on sale with an additional 25% off. it has a very cute design on the back and will be cute on while running errands on a hot day. it's true to size: i'm 5'6""  150 lbs and m fit well."
1,"I bought this blouse in the purple motif and love it for work. great design and print. based on the existing reviews  i sized down from my normal xs to an xxs and i actually wish that i would have stuck with the xs only because the blouse is tighter on my biceps than i would prefer  but i am keeping the blouse. i always appreciate this in other reviews  so hopefully it helps: i'm 5'2""  117 lbs  and a small 32b."
-1,"Love the silhouette and coziness of the fabric. for the first few wearings  i was in love. then it began to pill horribly . . . would not recommend. my mother said  ""that's going to pill up."" and i ignored her. and she was right."
1,This is such a comfy top  and the fabric is really great. more supple / flowy than i expected. it does run larger than i expected. i typically wear a large  and it's almost more billowy than i would normally prefer. i would love to try a medium to see the difference  but since it was purchased online  i'm just going with it. this will get lots of wear this season.
-1,I love the design and fit and quality. have been looking for a long-line top like this and was willing to pay full price. i have that dreadful little roll right under my bust line and this sucks everything in nicely. smooths it all out. i'm a 38c and everything was contained nicely and fit great in the large top.     here's my issue - wore it once and the colors ran! i was so excited to wear this i didn't even wash the top (i rinsed and dried the bottom  though). and i'm not a swimmer. just let
-1,"Sizing is just getting unreasonable  and nothing fits unless it's a crew neck nowadays. this v-neckline would have been perfect if pictured as on the model  but on my 5' 4"" 115 lb frame  the xxs petite neckline came down so low my bra was exposed along the eyelet trim. additionally  the shirt looked like it shrunk in length  and wouldn't have covered a belt on my pants. it also did not match the product description and measured 22"" from the hps to hem. i'm unsure of how when pattern grading an i"
-1,"I ordered a size small. i am 5'7"" size 6 and the dress was a mini on me! way shorter than on the taller model. the stomach and hips gaped out from my body yet the waist was cut way too high  so the dress was both too small and too big! very odd fit. the material is soft  thick  stretchy and has a textured pattern which i liked. this one is going back."
1,"I bought this as a gift for a friend that is getting married in a few months. it's so soft and cozy  i'm tempted to keep it! i got the xs/s regular in white and was worried it would be too long but hits my natural waist (belly button) and i've got a shorter torso and am 5'4.5"". i got this during the 40% sweater sale and feel it is worth the full price. a fun piece but not one to keep you warm on a cold night  more of a cab to curb piece."
1,Bought this for my daughter in college for her birthday. i heard shouts of this being her new go-to top.  her roomies have already tried to borrow it. super comfy with a beautiful off-the-shoulder style.  no one can go wrong with this!
-1,I so wanted this skirt to work  love the design! but  it's way  way too long... i am 5  5  116lb  and the small is 1 inch on the floor. i step on the skirt as i walk.
1,I like the grey pattern and black and white contrast versions the best! very soft and falls nicely on my bust. the biggest differences wit the sizes are on length  so i ordered up for it would be a bit longer. it's a great piece.
0,I am a huge pilcro fan. however  these were beyond large. i am not even sure that the next size down would work. keep this in mind if you attempt these pants.
-1,This top was very cute but super short- and i am a short waisted petitie person-the waistline hits above your belly button- looks very silly.
0,I ordered the blue stripe and white in size large. i didn't like it worn off shoulder but it does stay in place  which is a good thing. and it looks okay worn on the shoulders. i find the fabric so uncomfortable and itchy that i couldn't wait to take it off  immediately. i tried them on again a second time  still hopeful  with the same outcome. sadly  returning.
0,"I thought this top was adorable in the store and online. it just didn't work for me. although it fit  it flares out too much in the front and just wasn't flattering on me. i am 5' 5"" and 128 lbs. and ordered the small."
-1,I was so excited for this to arrive. at the end of last summer  my favorite shirt (you know the kind - dresses up or down with ease - it's your go to for work or a night out with friends) was ruined and i have been searching for the perfect replacement. i thought that this would be a good contender  but i was ever so disppaointed when i opened the bag...    firstly  the base color is not accurately represented in the photograph - in person its more of a peachy off-whte instead of white. still pr
1,Really cute and very comfortable. material is thin and sheer. i wear tanks under things anyway  but especially in pink  you would need to. but love the style.
-1,These run small (i am 110 and got a size 4)  they were a tad tight on top. the waist fit but felt a little too snug  short from waist to crotch and then bloomed out in a nice but stiff ish material. they are a dark blue animal print. i felt like bozo the clown goes to the jungle. they looked so silly i had to laugh. even with the 20% off  these are going back. not even comfortable to lounge around the house in never mind being seen by anyone in person!
0,Beautiful but big. i exchanged my 0 for a 00  and  oddly enough  there was no difference! had a similar experience with another 00 blouse. am i crazy  or is the 00 size just a sham?
1,"This was a winner retailer!!!!! bought it with my birthday discount. a bit pricey  but when i wore it (over and over again) i can see why. the material is so soft  flows beautifully and is just the right length on me. i am petite (5'3"") slender at 115 and i wear it with wedge heels  just like the model. i did iron it when i took it out of the package but have not had to iron it again.    i have received many compliments on this dress. bought the washed denim look.    thank you!!!!"
-1,Love the design of the fabric. i actually bought these in both colors. i gave only 1 star due stitching on the fabric  it's very scratchy.
1,I love this dress! i was trying on some dresses in the store and the sales girl put this one in just for fun. i would have never picked this dress out. i didn't look awesome on the hanger. but i tried it on anyway and i ended up getting two other dresses at that time. but i couldn't stop thinking about how much i loved the way i looked and felt in this dress. so i did what any girl would do and bought it online. it took me a while to find it online because the picture on line doesn't do the dres
0,"I really wanted to love this  but it had so much fabric around the waist i looked like i was about to deliver twins. for ref  i'm 5'3"" 105 lbs. the top area fit fine (had a little extra room on either side under armpit area  but not so much it would've deterred me from keeping it). i adore peplum and flouncy tops--it wasn't that i didn't realize that was the intended style here. it was very cute from the front and back  but when i turned sideways it was just omg huge. like tent huge. i kept look"
1,I ordered this dress to wear for a rehearsal dinner. i almost consistently wear a medium in most clothing but for this picked the large because of my height. i was for sure it would be too short in any other size. when i put it on i was drowning in it! i would definitely order the small if i had the time before the rehearsal. has the potential to be super cute and flattering  yet the timing and sizing didn't work out. definitely give this one a try!
0,I'm a b-cup who hates traditional underwire bras  so i was excited to try this one out. while i appreciate that this bra has more structure and support than other wireless comfy bras  the cups provided too much coverage for my style. if you want to wear a shirt with a wide neck  or do a cute off-the-shoulder thing with your shirt  the top of the cup shows. bummer!
0,"I like this top  but it does not fit me correctly. i am 5'1""  and have a larger bust  34 c. this shirt fits in the length  but is tight in the bust. i would have to buy this in a medium. i normally wear an xs or s. the quality is better than most t shirts  and i ordered the red. the red is a deep and striking color  and one of the better reds i've seen this season. the biggest problem i had was the cut of the shirt. the top cuts in and doesn't provide coverage  my bras are not covered by this to"
0,"The cotton  the print  and the online presentation of this dress are beautiful  i ordered right away! but there are some discrepancies. the shoulders have a ""puff"" to them that i don't notice on the model  and that doesn't flatter athletic shoulders. the buttons are (cheap) difficult to button. the waist sits much lower on the model than it must on anyone else  it's nearly empire on me. and  there is a lot more volume in the skirt of the dress than is shown in any photo. because the dress is tig"
1,I absolutely love this top!! i bought the ivory color  and i am definitely considering buying the black as well! it feels true to size  but i did size up only because i like my tops to fit a little generous and flowy. i can't wait to wear this top all season long!
1,"I own quite a few deletta tops  and this one nails it. a great staple in a pretty color (i purchased the green). peplum tops can be hit or miss for me and often come up short or balloon out too much. this one is so flattering. i initially ordered a medium (5'8""  145) but exchanged for a small when i found the medium to be a little roomy on me. the small is perfect. the top is made of a medium weight material and is slightly fitted  nipping in at the waist. the ""skirt"" piece falls nicely and is l"
0,It was love at first sight when i saw this dress online. i have several maeve dresses which i love so i thought this would be a sure thing. i was really excited when it arrived because when i opened the package the dress looked just as beautiful...until i put it on. fit is fine from the waist down but the upper part fits very poorly especially in the back. not sure if it's the zipper that pulls the fabric or if there's just too much fabric in the back but the back of the bodice doesn't lie flat
0,"I am about 5'6""  135 lbs and usually wear between a small or a medium. i ordered a small  as another reviewer did. right when i took it out of the packaging  i could see that it was going to be much shorter than you can tell from the online photo. i knew the sweater was going to be cropped  but it falls right at the top of my hip bones. when i raise my arms up  my whole midriff shows. did not flatter my athletic build at all. the fit around the shoulders and chest is fine  skimming but not tight"
0,I'm on the fence about this one. it is pretty
-1,Such a cute skirt- but impossible to get on. ordered in an xs (i have a 25/26 waist) but could barely get it past my knees to step into. if you have any hips at all  unfortunately this skirt won't work. i was tempted to size up but once i got it on it fit great in the waist and already had too much material to size up to a small.
-1,I didn't really understand the other reviews until i received mine in the mail. i love cloth & stone and this is just not up to their normal quality. i bought the blue and yellow colors of this blouse. it's very soft  but the blue already had strings coming from under the arms and i hadn't even tried them on yet. material is super soft  but thin. cut is weird under the arms and tight. sleeves are also tight! i am usually an xs or s in cloth & stone so i ordered smalls. i just fit the arms  but t
-1,"As soon as i saw this dress i ordered it...i didn't want to miss out on it. i loved the look...the colors were so fun and bright...i thought it was going to be my perfect dress for an upcoming trip to hawaii. i am 5'4"" about 118#. i ordered a pxs. when it arrived i loved the feel of the fabric and the colors but was wondering what it would look like on as it was a lot of fabric. i know it is to be flowing but on me it was just awful. part is that the ties on the shoulder are sewn in place so i c"
0,As with most retailer tops  this sweater is boxy and baggy through the middle.  i ordered an xs.  it's a very nice  pretty sweater that i'm going to try in an xxs.  the v-neck does go down rather low so it will need a tank underneath. the lace accents are very delicate and make the sweater look more upscale.  the white is a soft winter white.
-1,I saw this dress and loved everything about it! i was so sad when i tried it on and it was just too big. they were out of the smaller size  so i had to return it. the dress is well made and the color is just a bit neon compared to the picture.
-1,With all of the glowing reviews of this dress  i so badly wanted to adore this very special cocktail dress. it fit nicely  the quality was great  but there is a decorative (?) line of hook and eyes down the front which come undone with the slightest movement. i wore the dress out one time and was paranoid the entire time  kept glancing down to make sure i hadn't come undressed. i suppose i could've gotten out the needlenose and crimped them all shut  but decided to take it back. i didn't see tha
0,I tried this dress on in the store. it fit okay  but the orange is so bright  i couldn't bring myself to buy it.
1,I ordered:  xsp  xxs  xxsp    xxsp was the better fit  some people loved it some didn't like as much (thought it was baggy and are not used to seeing me in baggy clothing. but that being said  ti was comfortable  the cutouts fell right on spot on my shoulders  and it is a nice casual embellished look half tucked in some boyfriend jeans. i reordered mine as it had something stuck on it and it bothered me (like sticky white) i will re-evaluate when i get the new order only because there are sooo m
0,I was very excited to get this but very disappointed once it arrived. the fabric on the back is thin and clingy. i think you'd have to wear a slip underneath. cute design on the front but sadly it's going back.

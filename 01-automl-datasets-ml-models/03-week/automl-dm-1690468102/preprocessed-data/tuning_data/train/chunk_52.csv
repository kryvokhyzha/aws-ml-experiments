1,This shirt is nothing like the online pictures. it's a stunner in person. ended up with the black one though i was torn between it and the white. i would agree with some other reviewers that it has little to no give across the chest so i bought a l due to broad shoulders. the m fit like a glove and i was afraid it might tear if i raised arms or reached for something. not sure if a large busted girl would be comfortable. though i sized up  it didn't affect the way it hangs and it hangs beautifull
0,So  so cute. totally flattering. but the seams don't lie flat and there are loose threads all over the place. i've had issues with quality from retailer for a while (random holes in things) and was disappointed this fit that bill. i'm keeping it anyway because it's so cute!
-1,I was really excited about this sweater  but the fit was terrible. the sleeves were the right size  but the body of the sweater was a tent - absolutely no shape. they must have clipped the sweater on the model. for reference  i'm 5'4 and 120 pounds and ordered a size small.
-1,It's a cute top but once i washed in cold water and laid flat to dry it shrunk and lost it's shape. very disappointed. i am going to return top.
-1,I loved the photo of this dress. upon examination of the dress (and trying it on) after receiving in the mail  the dress shown online is nothing like the dress i received save for the pattern. the dress i received has a side zip as well as a belt and no pleats on the top. the bottom is also cut straight across not as it appears in the photo. turns out it is not as flattering as it should appear.
-1,This is an adorable basic & i should have been wearing it once a week this summer  but instead the fabric developed noticeable holes after the very first wear. this brand makes some of the softest  cutest tees  but unfortunately more often than not are unwearable after the first or second wash. i wash on gentle & hang dry. not worth the cost.
0,These culottes run very large--more than 2 inches of gaping waist band in my usual size. i would have kept them if they had fit  although sitting in them on a hot day might cause major wrinkling
1,"I wear this out  but it's also a super comfortable to lounge around the house in. i measure 35"" 28"" 40"" (6 through the top  10 in the bottom). i ordered a medium based on comments from other users concerning the top and it being constricting. i didn't find that to be true  but for a closer fit i probably should have ordered the small. overall  this is a fun dress to wear."
-1,I ordered in blue. so excited at arrival; it looked gorgeous...then i tried it on! i'm 5'  106#  34d and my upper arms are a little muscular. i normally order 2p (sometimes 0p)...and never a problem. this top was sooo tight under the arms and at the upper arms...if i tried any movement would have probably ripped out the seams! maybe i just received a product that was mis-sized  or defective. all i can say  if you have skinny arms  you'll love it.
0,I ordered my normal size in this dress. i am 6 foot tall  but the regular sizes were too large and too long (mid-calf). i returned the dress for a size smaller in petite for a more flattering hemline. the dress is lovely  especially on the models in the pictures  but didn't quite work out for me. also  it feels like there are hundreds of closure hooks that make putting on/taking off the dress seem to take an unusually long time!
-1,I wanted to love this shirt. it's not my usual style buy it looked so great online. unfortunately the actual shirt is much more brown in color and design than i thought looking online. i'm fair coloring & it just wasn't flattering. i'm thin but have a larger chest and this style just wasn't right for me. could definitely be cute on someone else but not a good match for me.
-1,I love this brand and the material of these shirts and have a ton similar and thought this was adorable with the sweet detail but it is super short and boxy and i felt uncomfortable with the length on me and it also made it so it wasn't so flattering on. such a bummer cuz its a sweet spin on a plain basic tee!
0,"It gets a little old to receive products over and over that do not match the photo or description of the product  retailer! the photo shows a black pant with blue colored striping. the pants that i got are black with green and brown striping. i find the color combination in the photo to be what i wanted and since the fit was nice (albeit short and i'm only 5'5"" tall) i would have kept these. unfortunately  the pants that i got are nowhere close to the description so i will be returning them. the f"
-1,This shirt aesthetically is very pleasing. i love the overall design and colors. however  when i tried it on i was immediately itchy! the material is not soft like a cozy sweater ought to be. in addition  though i ordered a size medium  it fit very large - almost too oversized. the sleeves were extremely long on me and the overall body was too big. it's too bad  i really loved the look but i'm not the type to layer. if you are  go for it  but get a size smaller than you normally would!
1,"This is the most beautiful dress ever! i'm very short and petite with an hourglass figure and a rather large chest. this dress feels like it was made for me. i often have a difficult time finding a dress that flatters my figure and is slimming. i was shocked that it was even a little roomy in the chest. the cut is so beautiful and it is very well made. while the lining might be too short for tall girls  being only 5""1  the lining is perfect. the length in the back is just a teeny bit too long so"
1,Soft knit  perfectly finished  comfortable and looks great on the model and the previous reviewers' mom.  it just looks too 'empty-nester' for my style (and i won't be until 2035!)  this is a nice base for a creative dresser/accessorizer  which i'm not.  i'm also messy so it's hard to keep ivory clothing coffee free.  i'm glad i tried it on because it proves how great a label knitted & knotted is for quality garments.  just had to pass on this for personal style reasons.
0,The color of this top is lovely. however  i felt the quality was lacking for the price. the fabric is thin and the top i tried on in the store had some loose threads already. fit was tts for me.
0,I like this top but unfortunately i will be returning. it's way too long. the color is pretty as is the design minus the length. it makes it look frumpy. maybe if they offered it in petite or if you're taller  it would work for you.
1,Love the pockets! fits loose  but lies nicely. comfy but able to be dressed up or down. great versatile dress.
1,"When i was purchasing this i asked to myself ""do i really need another black jacket"". when it arrived i realized that this is not just another black jacket. this jacket is special. it is light weight - but structured. it is the perfect length and the fabric feels amazing. this jacket is my new favorite."
-1,After reading the other reviewers i decided to try this out. unfortunately  the material does not fall nicely on me and the belt hits in an unflattering spot. i like the idea but it's just not a flattering cut or material. going back!
1,I love this coat  and wanted it to fit so badly! a 12-14 always fits well  but i can't even start to button up the large in this coat. so sad!!!
0,Finally decided to join the yoga-wear craze and thought these tights and a few other pair from retailer would help me transition to this style. my size l tights were just that -- tight! so tight  i really didn't want to pull them up past the knee!! i am not kidding. i wear size 14 pants and my legs are toned and shapely  so there was no reason to expect a l wouldn't fit. so sad.
1,"Love this top! kept looking online  but really wanted to try on. so once i made it to a store  i was so happy they had my size! i'm 5'1""  but prefer regular sizes in retailer for the length. i got the xs and it is a lovely fit  tts. love the colors in the pink top!"
1,This precious skirt is a treasure chest of soft bronze fabric circles scattered like coins at the bottom of a fountain. the circles are a bronze color and cannot be felt through the skirt net. it's finely finished and simply a nice piece for dinner out or a day in the office. i received many compliments on my first wearing.
1,As the other reviewers stated  it does run large  i sized down 1 size and it's perfect. great dress to wear so many ways.
0,Really was excited to get what i thought would be a very versatile piece. unfortunately because i have ample hips  the skirt just made me look very wide overall. in addition  i am short at 5'2 so the length was also not flattering plus it is high waisted - it was just a lot of denim on me that made me look too wide and even shorter.
0,I was excited to receive this dress because it seemed like a beautiful  breezy dress for summer. unfortunately i didn't find the fit to be very flattering. as two other reviewers mentioned there is too much fabric creating an odd bunching especially at the back waistline. i also found the dress to be a little tight across the bustline  upper arms and shoulders. the bunching can be improved by pulling the fabric of the dress forward in the front but this creates more of a plunging neckline than i
-1,I've been looking for a nice summer maxi dress and after reading some positive reviews  i decided to get the dress. the fabric is soft and has a nice flow to it. however  i had to return the dress because the cuff of the sleeve was too tight on my forearm  which make it impossible for me to raise my arms.    i ordered size petite xxs
1,Really like the loose flowiness. runs big went from med to small with better results. style is forgiving
0,"I'm 5'4""  130 lbs  curvy and fit. i'm usually a size 6 but when i tried these shorts on  they were tight. i sized up to an 8 and they looked better. but overall the fit was not flattering on a petite  curvy frame. i think these shorts would work on someone taller and a bit thinner in the thigh area."
1,I love this top and bought it in both colors. what's really fun is that i found a pair of espadrille sandals to match the sandy beige and white colored top and i have attached a photo of me under my arbor to show you. these tops are designed to have a flattering fit. i ordered size small and they are not too tight. i am 36 c in the bust line and an hour glass figure on bottom. i love that they are off the shoulder a bit and in a v neck  which is flattering on me. the material is soft and of good
-1,I bought these on sale and they quickly went back. i was very disappointed after reading the reviews. i thought for sure these would be a winner. however  i was sadly mistaken. i ordered another pair of jeans  the same  from a different brand. these were way too small while my others were too large. they didn't live up to my expectation and were still rather long. even though i bought these on sale  i was not happy with the quality.
0,Unfortunately i had to size down twice with there pants. great feel  they're soft and the grey is a soft color.
0,I bought this (because it looks beautiful  is well made  and a high quality piece). when i got it home and tried it on  it did not achieve the look i was going for (boho). instead  it was very drapery and full and big and i felt like i was wearing a ghost costume on halloween. i do love retailer's kimonos and thought i'd love this one. but it's going back. i don't need any more clothes in my closet that i do not absolutely love and want to wear again and again. that is my new criteria for purchasi
-1,I ordered this and thought it would be cute for work  but it tuns out the sleeves are ridiculously long. i am 5 foot 10 and do not have short arms. also it is a bit short waisted for me. i do love the floral detail of the button.
-1,On me  this top is totally frumpy and boxy. i am 5'9  34dd and the bottom hung on me like a bedskirt. not fitted at all. i ordered a large--not being sure of fit. i have a flat stomach and it just hung....yuck. honestly  for the price and fit  i wouldn't consider a medium. i think it would a tad better but not worth the price.
0,Cute. i love the button back detail. but it's completely see-through. i could have worked with that by putting a cami underneath  but the arm holes were too tight. didn't look bad  just felt uncomfortable. you can't really tell in the pic  but there's elastic on the arm holes. it'll work if you have super skinny arms  but apparently i don't.
1,"This is a beautifully designed and made sweater dress. really love it. however  there's no way that model is 5' 10"" in the photo because i'm 4 inches shorter than that  and the dress is 2 inches shorter on me. it's really not a dress  it's a tunic. i'm happy with it because it's so pretty  but i did think i was buying a dress. i just wore it with leggings and i'm happy with a beautiful tunic!"
0,I wanted to love these  but they're so tight around the top. my legs are normal size and i couldn't get them above my knee. the top isn't stretchy...it has a string that keeps it from expanding. they are so very cute  but unfortunately must go back for me.
1,I love the coziness of this sweater. i do think it is designed for a looser fit  but i sized down for a closer fit. the sleeve design is unique and flattering i think  kind of of like a cap sleeve would be if you were wearing a long sleeve shirt under it. i gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because it does shed some  but has so many other positive features that i am keeping it and plan to wear it with lighter colors so i don't need to worry about it. just lovely really  love the blue color especially
-1,I was so excited to get this classic-looking retailer dress- i love the ladylike shape and whimsical print. the popsicle print on this dress is really  truly adorable. unfortunately  the dress is cut really weird and it made me feel like screaming: i bought a size two and it was snug and gaping at the chest (and i'm only a 32b  ladies  so be warned!) at the same time  the arm holes were huge  i mean massively big. i think if you have a swimmer's body this might work. otherwise  you'll for sure nee
-1,The dress didn't meet my expectations  specifically the color  the texture  and the cut of the dress. although the dress was very well made  it just wasn't right for me.
1,"I saw this dress in the store and immediately grabbed it. i think that if i'd only seen it online i wouldn't have looked at it twice. in person  the fabric is so beautiful  a shining and classy velvet crinkle that could go way way dressy with the right accessories. this dress runs large  like all of floreat's items. i am 5'2"" 110# and normally wear an xs or 0  but had to size down to xxs petite for the right fit (like on the model). the only drawback is dry clean only. based on the content of th"
0,The purple/cobalt is a beautiful color. i feel the t shirt material is entirely too thin for the price.
1,The coral is stunning. the shirt has a slight flare at the bottom that you can't see in the picture  it isn't a straight cut. the sewn edges are rough style making the shirt right for casual wear with jeans  or dressing down something fancier.
-1,I ordered the white and the light blue in size xl. both are cut much smaller than is typical for my other retailer xl blouses. everything the first reviewer wrote is true. the photos of the white top show a detailed back when it is plain (like the blue). the back is just a solid  kind of slippery material. it's strange because it's not see-through in the back but you need to wear a tank/cami for the front. so  it makes the shirt that much tighter since you need to have the extra layer.     i would
0,I love the metallic colors of this top and figured i could wear it under a ruched jacket and circle skirt for work. welp  that's out the window. this design is poor. for one  this is not a piece for a petite woman with no torso and i don't know how anyone with a longer torso wears t his. this hits above my belly botton on and i got apetite 2. i have no torso. so  without a jacket  i would never wear this. it's very low cut..the back is very low..it's a little loose but i run between a 2 and a 4.
1,This button down is to die for! the material is incredibly soft and comfy. it looks great with my retailer leggings  and is also a great look with my casual denim  paired with a cardi and flats or booties. i've worn it several times for different looks and always get compliments on it! definitely a head-turning piece.
1,Wish i had snagged both styles of this shirt before they sold out. this is a very cute  work appropriate top - good weight and quality to the shirt. i wear a lot of black and white at work (so sick of gray..why are all business clothes gray?) and this top will be added into my regular rotation.
-1,I ordered a size 12 and it was huge on me! very loose fitting dress. i didn't like the material either.
0,"I loved the look of this online and ordered the xs as maeve seems to run large and that was the smallest size offered. the length was good for me (only 5'4""). the elastic top fit well (32b) but then from there it was too much fabric. i thought this would be a straight fit or a slight a-line but it was just a huge amount of fabric on me...several inches on both sides big. i think with the large ruffle along the top and the tremendous amount of fabric hanging down from the dress underneath the ruf"
0,Ugh.  i was so excited to get this dress and for 30% off.  this dress is adorable.  unfortunately the top part is super tight around my girls.  otherwise the fit was perfect.  very disappointed in the top of this dress.
0,I love the colors of this top. it does run very large though. when i received my usual small i felt like i was swimming in the top  not fitted at all. the material is a bit funky too - seems a little lower quality because of the fabric. will return and try a smaller size if there is one available at the store and see if i change my mind.
1,Love this top. great twist on a traditional plaid. looks great with skinny jeans or leggings. i get compliments on it every time i wear it.
0,Love the wear of these jeans but they run small! designed holes have grown much larger-i don't dryer dry them.
1,These jeans are great. the rise is perfect.
1,I picked this up in the store during the retailer weekend sale. i used to have a similar long black stretchy skirt that i wore until it fell apart. things i really like about this skirt are that it's basic black  but has some interest in the small swiss dots in the top layer  and it's stretchy. the yoga-pant-waistband seems like it will be very comfy and also allows you to adjust the skirt length a little bit  depending on whether/how much you fold it down. it is lined  which is a big plus. i was
0,Soft cotton front  slightly more coarse back. shoulders run slimmer than bottom which flares out. bought on sale as a cute pajama top which will definitely work well. could also imagine with skinny jeans. normally wear a s  ordered an xs.
1,I love this dress! it feels great on. it's very light. the color is absolutely gorgeous! the only thing i was disappointed in was that there was no lining  for the cost of this dress  it should at least be lined.
1,Love the length and long sleeves. so comfy to sleep in! great purchase  i ordered the navy one too!!
0,I tried this in an xxsp. i am normally an ssxp or xsp. it fit me well everywhere except in the crotch where i was given a slight wedgie. not the look i was going for. if i sized up  the rest of the jumpsuit would be too large on my frame.     also  i don?t feel the quality matched the price point. the one i received had a lot of loose stings already and it was unopened previously. that being said  it is a beautiful color and on the right body  the style would work well. it just wasn?t for me.
-1,When i tried it on  it was a bit shapeless  but it was on a promo so i decided to get it. i kind off like shapeless. i've worn it three times and washed it gently in the machine as recommended (in a lingerie bag  always) and air dried it. it now has a huge rip on the sleeve seam  and i cannot see how this happened. the inner lining is soft and substantial  but the outer gauze layer is thin.
-1,"I was struggling with the options above-- does it fit true to size or is it too small or too large? it is both too small and too large  which is really strange. the model makes this shirt look stunning  but the product is actually very boxy. i am 5' 3""  weigh 112 lbs and i typically order anywhere from a 00p-0r/xxs-xs. i ordered this shirt in an xsp and the shirt sleeves were short and the middle was boxy. quite frankly  it looked like a maternity shirt and the structure was not worth the money"
-1,I am usually a size o and ordered and xs ...due to the band in the center (not much give) it was a little difficult to shimmy over my hips but the body fit perfectly when i got passed that part. that being said the cup design is a hot mess. i am a b/c cup size and the top on this could not handle it. i felt fully exposed. i thought maybe if i went a size up i could get a little more coverage. the body felt ok on the small but the cups were still just too small. i still felt to exposed. they are
-1,This dress had beautiful details  and the material was better than i expected; however  it was huge! it completed swallowed me. i am 5'1 about 106 pounds with quite a bit of muscle. i ordered a 00p and it still looked like a sack.
1,Love the length  color  and rise. new favorite jeans! they're a little loose around the ankle and the way they hang is the only thing i don't like.
0,Beautiful well made top.it just runs small not for me
-1,The jeans look so different online! the pair i got did not have the stone washed look and was completely different cut. the rise is not as stated and is actually 10.5 inches! also  i'm a true 25 and the waist is like a 27  but the legs are super skinny. i'm so disappointed and i'm not even sure if is worth swapping out for a smaller size. these look more like men's cut jeans.
0,This is a truly beautiful dress  and yes  so much better in person.  upon examining the dress  however  i saw some problems.  the embroidery above the waistline was loose in places  there were some frayed ends  and even some &#39;fuzzy&#39; spots where it looked like the stitching had rubbed against something.  the dress is over $250  and for that price i expect the embroidery to be top-notch.  returning and hope the replacement is in better shape.  if so  it will be a keeper!
-1,Very nice fabric and quality but runs very large. i had to return my pair of a size 0. stinks to pay for shipping on a product that looks so different in the picture.
-1,I bought this in the blue and really wanted to like it--i had plans to check sizing and then order it again in the red  as well! however  this skirt falls victim to the recent design trend of using a pattern for a structured skirt but substituting a softer fabric and (horrors!) an elastic waistband. this ended up just looking kind of cheap and sweatshirty as a result. back it went.

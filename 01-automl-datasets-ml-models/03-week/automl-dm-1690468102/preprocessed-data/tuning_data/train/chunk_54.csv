1,"Fell in love with this sweater the minute i saw it. the crocheted front is stunning. the small fit perfectly  5'5""  36c. i am usually between a small and medium so if a small is usually roomy you may want to size down. it's a medium weight  soft and comfortable  not at all itchy. perfect for dressing up or down. look forward to many years of use from this fun  classic style cardigan."
0,I received this dress today for a june wedding. i was so excited about it and the quality is beautiful but unfortunately i am going to have to return it. it runs very big. i normally like to wear items a bit bigger/baggier but with this dress it needs to be tight on the sides. bummer :(
-1,This dress looked gorgeous in the monthly catalog. ordered in hopes to wear in easter. i felt it was frumpy and just ok. color was pretty but overall; i didn't love it like i hoped to.
0,I'm very pale  and on me the rose color looked really washed out. the catalog photo is not an accurate representation. look at the product shot for a truer representation. it's slightly see-through and was too close to the color of my skin. i think it would look delicious on someone who has darker skin  though.
0,I ordered the petite in my size  since i'm well petite  but curvy. i recommend this dress if you don't have a lot of boobage. unfortunately  for me the waist line came up high an inch below my bra line and made the dress poof out at my hips in an unflattering way. its so pretty and i was really excited about ordering it. it fits  but just is not flattering because of my boobs. this is always my problem though with dresses.
-1,It's a cute topper. it fits nicely through the shoulders and arms  and because of the a-line  through the bottom. but the chest is 3 sizes too small and i don't have a big chest. the fabric is very scratchy  and mine arrived unbuttoned and unzipped  and i suspect it had been worn.  going back. not tracy reese's best piece.
0,I am very into the lace tops! purchased this but it's a very exaggerated swing top and on someone who is 5'3  it feels almost like a tunic. lots of extra material in the back. love the look and if you're tall enough  it should work for you!
1,I got this on sale. i sized up from my normal 10 to a 12 based on reviews. the 12 is too large for me and i'd need a 10 which is sold out. the straps are very long. i think even if i sized down  i'd have to have them altered. also  the dress i got is missing the bottom button. sending back. i'm not too sad  i ordered the pink pippa swing dress with the same order and love it.
-1,I bought this top in the store  which was good because i ended up wearing a size smaller than i usually do. i loved the flowy fit of it. the washing instructions say machine wash cold  tumble dry low. i washed it on cold and hung it to dry. it shrank to the point of being unwearable (the dreaded button gap!) and lost its softness. i hope the store lets me return it.
-1,I bought this dress for a holiday party  and the sequins on the dress were so much more blue that what it looks like in the photo. i still liked it  but when i went to try it on  it was just not working. i thought this was more of a loosely fitted look  but the upper bodice and waist seam are very tightly fitted. i would recommend sizing up  but be aware that the top straps (shoulder to breast) are too loose to begin with  so they may sag.  overall  i wouldn't recommend this dress for the curren
-1,"Not at all tapered at waist as suggested here by photos. i have wide shoulders and am slim  and this made me look big all around. i am doubtful a smaller size would correct this- i am 5'10"" and ordered a medium. also  it curls under a bit at the waist. one nice thing about the cream is that it is not see through. anyway  i purchased this to go with high waisted skirts but am returning."
-1,I was expecting a nice golden yellow color but what i received was very dull in color with greenish undertones. very disappointed. will be returning.
0,Just a heads up - this is a romper - pants and not a dress! you can't tell from the pictures. i ordered thinking it was a dress but it's actually ... culottes? i'm not sure what you would call it. the pull on styling was awkward and the sash was bulky. it definitely goes back!
-1,Got this in the blue and was so excited. while it looks cute  someone had clearly bought this  worn it  and returned it. it had human and dog hair all over it. not to mention some kind of red strings. it was pilling all over. so much for quality control!!! i don't mind buying used things but at least clean it up and give me a discount!
1,Fits perfect!! tank top or bath top. swings nicely and not too tight on top. i ordered large and am a 38 d. sits perfect not long not short!
1,Most casual tops are so sloppy now - not this one! great cut  wish there were more color options.
1,Saw this top online and hoped for the best. my hopes were rewarded! lovely lightweight summery top but i think with a cardigan it could be worn in the fall also. i asked 4 friends if they liked it and they all agreed it was very flattering so i decided it was a keeper. have worn it three times since purchasing and have received lots of compliments.
0,Beautiful top marred only by the armholes. i tried a small and a medium but alas  my bra showed under the arms. i my be overly endowed for this top  but the way it cuts  you would have to be braless to wear it. not for me  but wish it worked. it is really pretty.
1,Adorable dress  amazing fit!
1,Like the idea but the tee was was very boxy. i tried the size small and it fit at the shoulders but the body was very big. i would say they pinned it for the product photo:)  i'm 34a...usually a size small. it was soft and fun but a no for me at this price.
-1,Was very disappointed with this dress. it's very baggy  no shape. felt like an oversized sack. purchased in med. bust area was only semi good fit all else flopped :(
1,Good quality shirt. cute design and not sheer. not quite as loose and stretchy as most of retailer's shirt  but good fit.
0,I am returning. i really liked the appearance in the photo and i love aqua  but the biggest problem for me is the shape. it's pretty boxy and it's hard to tell from the photo  but it has a batwing shape. i also wish the lighter portion were more ivory (less yellow in it)  but that's based on what looks better against my skin tone. i found it to run true to size  but i thought it was unflattering (made me look wide).
1,I love the loose vibe of this top. the bold stripes are super cute. i can dress this up or wear with jeans and sneakers. get this top ladies!
1,This is such a nice little sweater to add to a dress or tank. fits true to size and i love the tie and hook and eye closure. quality.
1,"I love  love  love this top! the color is beautiful  a pinkish-orange  about exactly how it looks online. it is soft and light weight for summers. it does run a little big  i debated between a 0 and a 2 and ended up with a 2  i'm almost 5'7"" and 130lbs for reference. it wings out on the sides at first  once i steamed it at home and relaxed the fabric a bit it draped nicely  so don't let that turn you off from it when trying it on! part of the design is cut out through out as a warning "
0,Gorgeous  but the trim detail on both in-store coats was already trashed and falling apart. for $218 and it can't even make it out of the store intact? i love the look but didn't want it to fall apart. they should've done an extra reinforcing stitch on the trim. such a shame!!
0,I so wanted to love this but was underwhelmed - ii am tall but yet it hit below my knee in that awkward spot that is just a tad too long to be hip stylish and too short to be evening cocktail - just felt / looked frumpy ... i do think it looks great on other reviewers though so may just be that if wasn't a good fit for my body type - i wore my normal size 6 and it just didn't flatter - made me feel 10 years older
-1,I was so excited about this top  as the picture of the model it looks beautiful and drapey in just the right way. unfortunately  this top feels like an old grandma's polyester suit  the sides are much shorter than the front & back and the combo of the inner lining and the outer fabric feels awkward with the inner piece being significantly shorter the the outer. it also puffed out a bit at the top of the shoulders in a strange way  due to the layered fabric.     sadly  going back.
1,There's not much to add to what reviewers have said. beautiful  flowing  light-weight fabric. flattering cut. gorgeous ombre tone with feminine embroidery. a great shirt for hanging out of dressing up. this is one of those shirts you expect from retailer. you wouldn't find it anywhere else.  i've had this shirt a couple of months now and have to note that even with careful treatment  some of the embroidery is coming loose. it's gotten to the point that i want save it for special occasions rather t
0,I had reservations about this top based on other reviews  but it looked cute on the model so i took my chances. i have an athletic build--not model-thin  but not dumpy either--and this top made me look very frumpy and matronly. the sleeves were especially unflattering. i purchased it in an ps and might have done better with a pxs.
1,I absolutely love this dress! the fabric is very light and airy while not being revealing. the color  being nude as indicated  is a nice change from plain white or off white and the embroidery is just beautiful and makes this dress quite unique. i love the fact that it is a tunic dress which lends to less of a structured look and more of an easy casual style. i recently wore this dress to an out door bbq and was both cool and comfortable all day. i also received many compliments from friends and
-1,I ordered not one but two sizes of this dress to try on and was hoping to ultimately wear to an event - one 00 petite  one 00. the style  color and cut are all perfect. one not so minor downfall  however. the zippers on both dresses were faulty - they both broke in the same spot  both during the first time just trying them on. i can't get either of them to even budge now - will either need to take back or get fixed. very sad about this.
0,"This top is very light and soft for summer. even the lace is soft. it's not sheer and doesn't require layering. true to size. i'm 5'4""  34dd  150 lbs- m fits well. my arms are not tiny and yet the lace weren't tight for me. but the quality of the material is average and it feels like it will last barely one summer. it's good if you are paying the sale price."
0,This is a lightweight knit dress that is well-designed but very form-fitting. i decided to return it because at almost 40 there are parts of my body that i don't need to show  but if you're in great shape or willing to wear shape wear  this would be super cute.
-1,"I can't believe the reviews this dress has gotten. i ordered it and was so excited to get it. when i tried it on all of my excitement was gone. while i love the color the quality just isn't there and its not worth the money even with the 25% discount i used. the fabric is not thick  in fact it is quite sheer for ""velvet"". i honestly wouldn't feel comfortable with out a slip on underneath this. second is the fit. i'm 5'6 32a  xs on top 4 on bottom and i ordered an xs and the way this hung on me w"
-1,Weave on the sweater quite open and easily snags . the first day i wore it the seam on the sleeve began to unravel. needed to use a crochet hook to reweave after the first wearing. not confident that it will hold up well to its first wash.
0,Omg - i laughed so hard after i put these on. i was so excited to get them. i ordered them in my usual 4. i got a little suspicious when i pulled them out and noticed they had an elastic waist band.  they were a little too small for me and even if they were not it's hard to imagine a world in which they didn't make me look like an oompa loompa or a hobbit! they are beautifully made and i kept looking at the picture and wondering why they don't look like that on me? i definitely have a curvier sh
1,These joggers are gorgeous--you can even dress them up! the quality and softness is amazing and very expensive looking. the fit is perfect not to mention the fact that they are very flattering. really  i knew the minute i saw them  i would love them. but  i do have to say that the lovely model wearing them ---the model with the wine colored shirt and the awesome red bag (i bought that too!!!)and that big smile sold me!. many thanks to retailer--personal stylists carolyn and blair. always so helpfu
0,I bought this sweater online and was surprised by how thick and fluffy it is. this is a warm and cozy sweater  more bulky than oversized. pattern has a comic book-style art look. it has raglan sleeves and a boxy cut and narrows a bit at the waist. cute  warm sweater for winter--wore with an undershirt.
1,"I bought this shift dress for a ""black & plaid"" nye event  and it fit the bill perfectly for a cold winter's night. looks great with tights and boots  has pockets  and dresses up nicely. i like a good shift at this point in the holiday season -- leaves room for that last bit of seasonal eating and drinking. looking forward to wearing this through the winter months."
-1,This dress hit my waist in a weird spot and was too short. i would not have felt comfortable bending over. it was a tad too full which wasn't flattering either.  i really wanted to love it bc they design is adorable.  i need to return it!!
-1,This was so boxy and unflattering. i loved the lining and the fabric was very soft but it looked like i was wearing a bag. was hoping to use this as a cute top layer for dresses but it was a terrible fit. sizing down would not help this one. went back!
1,Great fitted tee. nice styling. hard to find tees that are fitted-- they seem to make most of them these days like boxes i suppose because it's easier to make. this looks great and feels good. true to size. loving it!
0,This dress is nice colors and well made but it's just not the style for me. it almost fits frumpy. i'm not sure that a belt would even make it look good. also being 5'8  it is shorter than i'd wear. i like at least touching top of the foot for a maxi.
1,"This dress is as comfortable as it is adorable. i am 6'2"" and usually wear 12/14 but the 10 fit me. love  love  love this dress!!"
-1,As a beach cover-up this would be great  but i'm surprised retailer calls this a dress and doesn't show on the model how thin it is. it's pretty sheer and i couldn't get away without layering it.
0,"This tee was meant to be loose and swishy  but as it runs large  sizing down means the sides come up really high  as they curve a good 3-4"" higher up. so your waistband is exposed  and it just doesn't look nice:( returned an xs and small."
1,These are very cute but very  very stiff. have washed 3x and still not relaxing. not a bad thing but they are a little uncomfortable the first hour of wear. my waist is smaller and generally  have gap in waist to get fit right in hips. super cute with sandals  mules  duck boots.
1,I have had this dress for a few months now and find it is super comfortable for the hot weather and can go dressy or casual with the right accessories. it does run large in xxs; the xxs petite fit a little better by was way too short for me. even better is that you can wash on the super gentle cycle and lay flat to dry. yes it says dry clean only  but its is made of cupro and you should be able to wash that material. i have washed mine several times and it has never shrunk or lost shape. the she
-1,I'm sure there's someone out there who will look good in this but it certainly wasn't me. admittedly  i'm a less than ideal body type at a curvy 5' tall. still for a taller person this shirt runs short  for a curvy person this does nothing to accentuate a waist  for a short person this pattern is very busy even if the colors are beautiful  for a busty person the gathers around the chest make for a very frumpy look  and even for a short and thin person this shirt runs too big to get a good fit. c
0,This top has dry clean only. didn't like the fabric. plus mine was a return. i also returned it because the left arm has a hole. now it's for sale again. if your looking to buy a large. don't.
0,I also wanted to love this top but sadly had to return it because it is very short and the peplum piece is very wide. it was not flattering at all.
0,"This top is cute  but i found issues with both the fit and the quality. i tried on an xs  but found it to be boxy on my petite frame (5'2""  110 lbs  34a). even worse  though  was the feel of this shirt. it's not lined  so you can feel every bit of the beautiful stitching on your skin. it was so itchy  and i only wore it for a minute in the fitting room. it's a pretty shirt  but not worth actually wearing."
1,Despite being a knit  this skirt holds its shape and is absolutely perfect. it goes with everything and is extremely comfortable.
0,Love the shape of this top and often look to retailer for corset-style summer tops that are pretty. this top is made from a thick  stiff fabric that doesn't breathe. so my usual size xxs was too constricting. tried an xs also and it basically fit but i still wasn't a fan of the very heavy fabric in a summer top. it's almost like a neoprene. the colors are an odd choice and not my favorite either. i wanted to see in person and they just don't cut it for me. would love in different colors and softer
1,I have this tank in all colors...it is superb for layering...comfortable and i love that you can reverse it for a different neckline...and it's long enough!
1,This shirt is versatile for work and fun. my sister has this shirt and thought it was so cute  i ordered it too.
0,So this is a great tee  problem is the white you can see through. i an not looking for a layering tee so not what i was looking for.
1,This blouse is so pretty! i love the design  the material  and the pattern is so unique. i love the sleeves and how they billow out just above the elbow and come in at the wrist. i think the amount of fabric is perfect and would not be nearly as nice with less. the cut around the top where it starts to gather and fall is so feminine and modern princess-feeling. i hope they make this same style in other colors and prints!!! i adore it and feel so good wearing it! if i could change anything  i'd m
1,Absolutely love everything about this dress. unlike many other dresses i've ordered from retailer it fits me in the chest (34c). it's very flattering. love the lace up front and the fabric is like a soft lined linen. can't wait to wear it. i got the s regular. if i was any bigger in the chest or through the ribs tho it would be too small. i almost ordered the medium and was certain i would end up needing a bigger size but the small turned out just right. like it was made for me
0,When ordering this product  i thought it was strange that the mediums were sold out. i went with the small which is generally what i wear. however  these run small and i see why the medium ran out. they are pretty  however  i wish they made them more true to size.
-1,I initially saw this top a few months ago  and fell in love. it ended up selling out in stores  so i ordered it online  where it was back-ordered by a couple of months. i received it this past week  and was sadly disappointed. the design is pretty  but overall the quality is sorely lacking. i wonder if maybe the first batch was good  but when they realized they were so popular  and had more made  the newer batches weren't as good? not sure. the one i got had inconsistent red embroidery  and ther
-1,I was so excited to get this in the mail... and loved everything about it except for the fact that it was only as long as one inch above my navel! i don't know why it looks like a normal length on the model. im returning it.
-1,I am petite and ordered size small  and it came looking like gym sweat pants. the material was very nice  but in terms of the waist and length size  both run incredibly large. the cuff of the joggers are also not elastic at all  and hangs loose widely. will have to return this item  unfortunately.
-1,I want to love this shirt  i really do  but it's huge! the top is tent-like  which would be adorable with skinny jeans  however the length of the back dips so low  the top kind of reminds me of pajamas. the color is beautiful  more like a light grey heather  and the white piping is like a shimmery ribbon material. overall  the top is cute  but it dips too low in the back and the bow weighs down the back of the shirt  so it makes it hard to adjust it in the front. sadly  it's a return.
0,When i first opened this dress and tried it on i thought it was adorable. it is very flattering on my hourglass figure and hides my recent baby weight. the problem is the hem. it was already rolling up when i took it out of the package  and i should have noticed and returned it  but i figured the problem would be easily solved by a good ironing. well  it wasn't  and it gets worse every time i wash the dress. it's like the hem isn't constructed properly.
-1,Very disappointed that i ordered this dress and a large was too big. returned and asked for an exchange to a size medium  it was apparently not available in the medium  i was charged a 5.95 fee for return shopping. so i immediately went to website  medium available and i had to pay another 12.95 for shipping. seems a bit unreasonable  but really liked the dress.
-1,Super soft fabric  however very short in the stride. i ordered an xl  normally wear 12/14.  i had to return it.
-1,I love relaxed-fit wide leg pants with some pockets and draw string  so naturally i was super excited to see these. i got them in gray and they felt and looked perfect right out of the bag  material was soft and flowy but not too thin. unfortunately the sizing is completely off unless i got a defective pair  i got my usual size l and they felt like s or smaller  i barely could get them on and i could not zip up. i'd need at least two sizes larger for them to fit at all. very disappointed  will l
0,This blouse is so cute...casual but still stylish. the problem was that is is a little short for someone with a long torso and it is almost too revealing...the v is so plunging you would have to either pin it our wear a cami. the beads on the ties on the sleeves are also rather heavy and they swing and roll around on your arm...maybe wouldn't bother some but it was a return for me.
-1,Cute and very soft  but the elastic wasn't sewn in right. i took them out of the wash and the waistband was a twisted mess. disappointing for more expensive loungewear.

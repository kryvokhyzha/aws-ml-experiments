0,"I expected to love this  since i usually look good in this style of jacket. it's definitely comfortable and the fit was fine  but i really don't care for the wooden buttons and the overall look was just ""meh."" it's going back  unfortunately."
-1,First of all  this is not pullover styling. there is a side zipper. i wouldn't have purchased it if i knew there was a side zipper because i have a large bust and side zippers are next to impossible for me.  second of all  the tulle feels and looks cheap and the slip has an awkward tight shape underneath.  not at all what is looks like or is described as. sadly will be returning  but i'm sure i will find something to exchange it for!
-1,Wanted to like this type. cute print. something about the width and length of this top didn't work on me. was a little boxy. i'm 5'4  135lbs  size xs-s. might be cuter on different body type  i'm hourglass and athletic.
1,I did not try this on alone but rather with a long sleeve white tee and white button down shirt. i really liked both looks. if i find it to be itchy like the other review i will have to return. this is an effortless fashion statement yet it could easily be a weekender cozy staple. my only complaint is why two neutral colors? this would have been great if offered in a richer darker yarn. the two offered colors are so similar and both looked drab against my skin tone.
-1,"These socks were so narrow  especially on top  that they pinched my thighs and we're almost painful to wear all day. my thighs are pretty narrow  i'm only five feet tall and my legs and hips are the thinnest part of my body. i understand that they need to be reinforced on top so that they don't slip down but these are definitely made for a person who is unhealthily skinny. ""one size"" is definitely not true. they also snag easily."
0,I kept this top  only because i needed a plain black tank  but there is nothing special about it. i found it a bit large and thin cheap material.
1,I agree the pictures are confusing. the front top of the dress is not cut out as some pictures seem to indicate. this is such a great dress! it has a great lining underneath and is really flattering and nicer/dressier looking in person than i imagined it would be. i think it fits true to size. i either wear a 4 or a 6 in most retailer dresses and the 4 in this dress fits me well. i'm planning to wear this dress to my bridesmaids luncheon! i definitely recommend!
0,I am sure these pants are right for someone  just not me. i am wider in the hips  and they just were really unflatering. the fabric is very lightweight  which i wasn't expecting  and so while the pleats are interesting  with my hips they ended up hitting in just the wrong place. the waist was also much lower than i expected -- not low rise  but i'm used to thinking high waist with wide legs. in short  these pants are probably great on some body types  just not mine. also very long. i'm 5-8 and a
0,I really wanted to love this romper and couldn't wait to try it on.   it's super cute and love the material but once on the top portion is way too baggy even after cinching the waist.   if i pulled the waist all the way down it looks smoother and nice   but if it sits at my natural waist   the back balloons out and it's unflattering.  it's too bad   i love the print and ease of this design.
-1,I saw tons of people raving about this piece so i had to check it out for myself. i love the vibrant colors and the design and while the fabric is delicate it feels amazing and light. i sadly had to leave it as the store as i am a girl with a larger chest and big hips. i looked huge and it was not flattering to my shape. if this dress came in a maxi with a high waist like i would be all over it. it is beautiful.
-1,This blouse has too much drapey fabric and it's just not flattering.  in the front part of the blouse the fabric is relatively short  but the sleeves have so much excess fabric it almost looks like a clown suit.  sending back.
0,I really wanted this jumpsuit to be my holiday staple! i ordered this jumpsuit in a sz 4 (my typical size) - the jumpsuit doesn't have a waist  i suppose the ribbon created the illusion of a waist. most jumpsuits are super slimming because of having a waistband and this does not besides the bow. also what i found strange is the back zipper goes all the way down passed your bottom - it's the longest zipper i've ever seen. it's very body hugging so it shows your curves if you have any. i will sadl
-1,The fabric is great. the design is fun. i thought the dress would be perfect for work and also wear for a fun night out. the fit was perfect up top but the bottom part was to full and a lot longer then i expected. so i had to return it.
1,Love the sleeves - good length and fit. it's a basic tee that has added flare.
1,This is such a pretty top.  i love the mix of patterns. the colors are beautiful!  it really looks great on.  the peplum is very minimal in this top.  the entire top itself is somewhat oversized  but in a pretty way.  i bought this in a large and probably could have gone with a medium  but didn't want the length to be any shorter  so i'm sticking with the large.  for reference   i'm 6ft and 175lbs.  i usually wear a size 10/12 or medium/large.  also  i didn't notice a puckering between the two m
-1,"I ordered this dress in a xs petite. i am 5'0"" 105 lbs. the plaid looks more drab in person and the fit was very frumpy. the wrap style is typically flattering but on this dress  the dress tied above my natural waist and the fit made my hips appear larger. i was pretty disappointed in this little number and will be sending it back. it might work on taller people  like the model  but i would steer clear if you are a petite."
0,I loved this dress the minute i tried it on and am actually really sad that i had to return it. however  the embroidery was unraveling in several places before i'd even worn it  so i thought it would probably only get worse. too bad because it's gorgeous and flattering!
0,It reminds me of maternity clothes. soft  stretchy  shiny material. cut is flattering and drapes nicely. i only found one button to close front... looked awkward. nice long sleeves. not for me but maybe for others. just ok.
1,I am a huge fan of absolutely everything tanvi kedia designs. her clothing is intricate  boho  colorful and fits like a dream. when i saw this online i had to have it. it just arrived today and its everything i imagined it to be! the fit is more like the studio pics and less like the first catalog pic. the dress definitely has some room  but it isn't quite as swingy as the catalog photo. i have a lot of curves  so it may be swingy on a more slender figure. i ordered an xl mostly because of the s
1,I was looking for a lightweight top to wear with black linen trousers to a party  i was not sure of this top seeing it on a slender model (i am a more typical 50 year old mom body) and i have never worn a peplum style. i put it on for my husband and approved  so i wore it. i received many compliments - a few from good friends who congratulated me for going out of my 'comfort zone' with the style!
-1,"This dress is just too baggy overall. i am 5'6"" 140 lbs and a size small was so unflattering. i can't go down in size because the waist detail will get too high on me. it was already a little high on the small."
-1,I purchased the blue with white dots. the shape was awful  but looked like a sack - returned
-1,This is a beautiful kimono but just isn't made well. the one i received already had a couple small holes and a pull in the thread that was very noticeable. after reading the additional reviewer who wore it an hour and it was already pilling  it is going back for good. such a shame!
1,This shirt feels amazing. it also drapes nicely and is very feminine and flattering. great versatile piece.
1,I am pleased with this skirt. the jean material is of good quality and it hangs right on my waist and hips. i ordered a 2 which left a little room in the waist to tuck in a blouse. i am 5/5 and 119. it works well for work and leisure.
-1,I found the fit of this dress odd. i typically wear a 6 or 8 in dresses. the 6 fit across the chest but the armholes were large so wearing a bra would be a challenge. i am a 34c so i need some type of support. i also thought the fabric was a bit flimsy for the price. i am a huge retailer fan and usually leave glowing reviews but sadly i left this one in the store.
1,"Since several reviews said that this dress ran small online  i decided to go to my local retailer store to try this on in person. i am 5""6""  120 lbs. and normally a 0 or 2. the 2 worked perfectly. i loved the red version online but thought the green was better for me in person (the red is a tomato red and was more overpowering on my fair skin). the green also has light blue in the detail print so maybe good if you have blue eyes. no problems with the zippers on the ones i tried at the store."
-1,Seems there was a design defect in this item--sleeves are way too tight and hardly go on without ripping the shirt. i have pretty thin arms so it's hard to imagine this not happening on anyone. too bad because it's otherwise a very nice top.
0,It's rare for a dress to completely not work on me  but this dress completely did not work on me. i'm tall and have an hourglass figure. i got this dress in my usual size s. this dress somehow made me look ridiculously pear shaped. the empire type bust of the dress made both my bust (32c) and my waist look pretty much non-existent. it looked so bad on me i actually laughed. it's a shame though  because i had been eyeing this dress for a long time. and it is a beautiful dress  but i would not rec
1,This dress intrigued me a bit online  but not enough to order it to try it. even on the rack  i wasn't so sure about it  but decided to try it this afternoon. i couldn't have been more pleased. it is fresh  flattering  flowy  light and beautiful. even though there is quite a bit of fabric  the vertical stripes and nipped in waist make it extremely flattering. i didn't realize this came in blue as well. i may add that one to my wishlist  but the red one is a definite winner. it will make a great
0,I love how different this dress is in terms of the design. it catches light beautifully. the short  biased hem makes the dress fun and flirty. but  this dress is completely sheer. there is no lining which is very disappointing. i do have a short  nude slip that makes this dress work for me. you will need a slip  for sure! unless you are rhianna. the sizing runs a little large  i probably could size down given the loose cut but overall the proportions are flattering showing off my legs. i will re
-1,This shirt runs gigantic and it's not even cute. i.'m done buying retailer online.
-1,Material is strange. triangle top is funky. this is just not awesome in any way.
1,I bought this dress for summer celebrations. the fabric is beautiful and the colors are soft and enhance the flow of the dress. the fit is true to size and i especially like that it is not too low cut in the front. i will pair it with a light sweater or denim jacket. definitely a dress than can be dressed up or down. very feminine and has a romantic feel.
0,This top is very nice. i ordered it in black  it looked very good. the embroidery and pleated details give it a very nice look. the fabric  however  feels like heavy cotton. it didn't feel very soft and comfortable  it was a bit hard for me to wear because i usually prefer soft cotton. while i think this will retain it's shape and not stretch like softer cotton  i am sending it back. it felt a bit heavy to wear.
1,I bought this dress to wear to a pre-wedding event at an out of country beach wedding in late fall  so i bought it a size smaller than normal  but it fits  so i could say it runs a little big. very cute though and i thought even more flattering than i thought it would be from the picture! i'm more top heavy  and it kind of camouflaged that  which is always great!
-1,I splurged on this top and was sadly disappointed. i'm a 36d  and the l was so tight i couldn't get it over my chest. also the arms were super tight and the length is nearly cropped.  and the fabric is shiny  the picture makes it look like it's matte. if it did fit like the model i would've loved it. the print is beautiful though. bummer
-1,1. this looks so cute on the model  doesn't it? i have no idea where you wear a suit with hot pants  but it looks cute.  2. that said  keep in mind the model is probably 6 feet 10 inches tall. i'm 5 feet 6 inches tall  and this jacket came down to my knees. i'm not kidding. the 3/4 length sleeves were at my wrist  so more like 7/8 sleeves.  3. i'm normally a size 12 in cartonnier jackets  but this only comes s  m or l. the medium is really a size 10  which was too tight across the shoulders and
-1,The styling of this top is so cute but the fabric is thin  kind of scratchy & has  almost no give to it.  it is very uncomfortable on & is very restricting as far as  movement is concerned.   cannot recommend - back it goes!
1,This top is both cute and flattering. it is also soft and the colors are gorgeous. i highly recommend
-1,"Finally received this in the mail today and was very disappointed. i am swimming in the xs (5'4""  110lbs). the colors are much more vibrant that shown in the pics - the green is a bright kelly green  the red is much more red than rust colored  etc. and it's a sweater coat! for the price i was expecting it to be lined and higher quality. i don't doubt that it will be warm  but can't justify the price. it's going back to the store."
1,I love this dress so much. absolutely beautiful true to the size. since i start wearing it i got so many good compliment. the flowers is very spring and summary. very sexy to the bottom....
0,I am undecided if i will keep this dress or not. i am 5/4  155 lbs and ordered both the small and medium. the medium was comically large on me  with broad shoulders and a sack-like appearance. but the small fit very well and felt very french girl chic. the brownish-greenish color is really stunning in person  like a greenish copper. and the gathered sleeves elevate this into a dressier look. but the material is sheer  so you would need to wear a slip  and the elastic waist still has somewhat of
1,I worry when i have an elastic waist  or something that resembles this  but the dress hangs like a dream. no puffing out  no gathers that you can see. it is not sheath  but not a line either  kind of in between  hits several inches above my knees  but perfect with some black tights for winter. i saw the note about grey  have to try it on agin in daylight  but i would say think black on the top  light camel color on the bottom i am 5'8  typically wear a size 12  and it was true to size for me the
1,Very light weight and soft fabric. i bought the blue but did not try green or grey. i love blue with my skin tone and am afraid green may make my skin look yellow. did not see the green in my store though. very comfy and flattering dress. runs tts.
0,There is simply a ton of fabric on this tee. i am a size 8 on top  with a fairly thin upper body but still an 8. at retailer i often order small for swingy tees  medium for more slim-cut. this tee in the small was huge. the shoulders fit well  but the body was so big and was a weirdly long length. just odd  especially for $78...
-1,"The review above titled ""so disappointed"" couldn't have said it any better. the dresses from last year are perfect. i probably wear them at least once a week. i was so excited to see this vibrant blue color and fully expected the same quality as last year. i'm generally an xs or s in dresses (however i have xxs from last year's version)  and the xs in this one is lifeless. it's heavy  hot  doesn't have the same nice shape as last year. i may cut out the integrated lining just to lighten the dres"
0,I absolutely love the look and fit of these jeans. i did have to size down. i ran into problems after washing. the fraying on one leg was twice that of the other  looking very unbalanced. after looking closely i found that one leg had a top stitching very close to the fray to prevent further fraying. the other leg did not have this stitching  thus the fraying double in size. i have sent a request to customer service for a replacement pair. these are adorable jeans just be sure to check for stitc
1,"This dress is still super cute despite its shortcomings. i agree with other reviewers that it definitely runs large  and very small petite/thinner ladies might feel it's overwhelming. it worked for me in my usual size l though. for reference i'm 5'3 and this hit just above the knee. and while the dress is ""roomy "" a smaller size would likely have been tighter or pulled on my fuller (36d) chest as there's not much give in that area. i agree that the armpit holes are ridiculous  but a thin camisol"
0,I really want to like this dress - it's beautiful  but it just fits like a sack. the yoke exaggerates my bust and the dress makes me look 20 lbs heavier. perhaps if you are tall and thin like the mode  or small chested  it would be great! the quality and color is beautiful.
1,"I agree with the other reviewer that the color isn't as pink in person and more subtle. my thoughts below on some other things:  __________  pros:  - pockets! makes it so fun and chic with the overall style.  - the material is lovely and breathable. i didn't find it sheer at all! of course  i didn't wear it outside the dressing room. the material is thicker but it hangs on the body well.  - runs ""mostly"" tts. i only tried on the medium and it fit everywhere being slightly tighter in the chest. i"
1,This is one of my favorite retailer dresses of all time. it is soo much better in person and on than the stock photos. very romantic and fun.
1,I loved this dress the second i saw it in the catalog and had to have it! i had been looking for a plaid dress for awhile but couldn't find anything that i fell in love with till this one. i love the front of the dress and the asymmetrical details. it's just beautiful. my only complaint would be that the back of the dress is pretty blah. after all the awesome going on in front  i was disappointed in the view from behind  but i still love this dress and will be keeping it and wearing it for a lon
-1,I purchased this in the yellow xs. it is very comfortable  but extremely see-through. you'd have to wear a slip or something underneath it  but i'm not sure what would work based on the style  and even if i wore a strapless bra it was still see-through. unfortunately i had to return it.
0,I like the look of this sweater and i am keeping it. however  i found the fit under the arms a little uncomfortable. there is a large seem that goes under the armpit and is a little bulky and irritating. also would not recommend if you are busty. because of how the stripes run  it looks stretched out over my chest.
1,"This is such a cute dress! the skirt is very full but does not add visual weight to those of us who already have enough actual weight. i ordered the black/beige print and the fabric is beautiful. it really drapes and hangs nicely. because there is so much fabric  i don't think this dress needs a lining. it seems to wash and hang dry well. i'm 5'4""  about 160 lbs. i like the way the medium fit. the length was slightly above the knee  which was ok with me (i'm nearly 60.) all in all  i can see mys"
-1,I wish i had read the other reviews before purchasing this product. label says that you can wash and dry normally. however  upon washing  the outer layer shrunk and the inner lining did not. the robe will now not lay flat; the fabric pulls at the edges  and results in the inner lining being revealed when the robe is tied shut. extremely disappointed. for a $100 garment  i expected much more. i wish i could return this.
0,I really liked this top when i saw it online. i went to the store to check the sizes. i am a small or a medium. i tried on the s and the xs. even the xs was huge. unfortunately the xxs is sold out. i don't understand the sizing on this at all. it's a shame because the top itself is very pretty. just be sure you try it on before purchasing.
0,Love the print  length  and cut. but the tie waist hangs in a weird way and seemed like it would stretch out and sag after a while. sad to return it.
-1,I liked this top okay but i did not think it was worth full price. i thought it was only average.
-1,I ordered this cardigan on sale and it was a wonderful fit and color. just the light sort of cute pullover i was looking for to keep and wear at work. unfortunately  it is poorly made. i wore it once and it already started to fray and fall apart. after closely inspecting the cause  i realized that the threads in the sweater are not fully sewed together  so the minute you put it on  one will start to unravel leading to a domino effect. it is a shame because the design and cut were truly a great f
0,These pants are cute. they seem  to me  to have a wider leg than appears on the model. they do run big  so i would recommend sizing down if in doubt. these are cute pants that can be dressed up or down  but unfortunately  look pretty sloppy by the end of the day  as they stretch and wrinkle very quickly. since they already run a bit big  this is a major negative. i wore them to church  and they were quite wrinkled by time i got home. by late afternoon  they looked like a different pair of pants.
0,I bought this because i loved it online but in person there is another level to the shirt that i did notice in another picture. i didn't like the second level on me since i am a shorter person. just didn't fit my body quite right.
0,Run large and leg is very wide. even sizing down  they seemed too floppy.
1,This shirt is so cute with skinny jeans and crossbody bag! i am 34b so i did not have the issue with the cut of top at the bustline. love it!
0,Love the top. love the color. love the back detail. as a larger chested woman  the shape was lost a bit. but i just couldn't resist.
0,I purchased this dress to wear to a beach wedding. i loved the color  the fit and the style. i even got a lot of compliments on it. the problem was that the wedding was on the beach  in florida 85 degree weather and when you are sweating the fabric changes colors and takes a really really long time to return to normal! unfortunately i had to return it. would be great to wear indoors  just watch getting water or anything else on it!
1,Beautiful cobalt blue dress. i wore it for christmas and had many compliments.
0,These are a wonderful trouser style pant. i love fitted than flared denim so this fit isn't my top pick but it's a cute style! thick quality denim fabric with a medium rise cut.
1,This is my new favorite top! looks and fits as described.
0,Online this dress looks so perfect  but in person it's a bit dowdy and unflattering  at least on me. i'm a size 4 with curves  and i was hoping it would enhance my waist and flatter my figure. but  sadly  it was too large on the waist and too poofy in the skirt  so it just did nothing for me. i considered sizing down to a 2 so that the waist would fit  but the skirt still has too much fabric  making my hips look large. so much potential  but missed the mark for me.

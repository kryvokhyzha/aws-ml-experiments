0,I normally get a small in this style shirt but it didn't fit at all so i had to send it back. too bad
1,I feel so lucky to have caught this as a popback--this dress is killer! it's casual style and simple design can be found at other retailers  but the quality and details and fit can only be made by retailer and dolan. it's body skimming but lined so it doesn't cling to flaws  the knit itself is substantial and it's a mockneck  not a turtleneck. i would say this dress runs small because i usually buy medium and this fit in a large. because of weight and lining  this is a spring and early fall dress
0,This top is very nice. good quality  good design. it just doesn't fit me well. i have a large chest and this is a tad fitted at the top  especially around my shoulders  while the lower half fits due to the pleats. the fit seems inconsistent at the top and bottom. i am full-figured  perhaps it would fit a leaner person better.
0,Slouchy relaxed fit. well sewn together and hangs well on the body. bottom hem hits upper thigh. good length and soft  easy fabric. light layering option as well. good spring jacket  can be kept on indoors without getting too hot.
-1,I was so excited to order this sweater but was so disappointed when it came. the knit is somewhat stiff and the sleeves are not as bell shaped as pictured on the model. overall i would of kept it if it were much less money  for the price it is just an ordinary sweater with no style.
-1,I ordered this online  and took it back the day i got it. i could not fit the neck hole over my head  therefore i couldn't even see how it truly fit. i had high hopes for this dress.
1,Beautiful lace shell! great with jeans for a night out  or with a skirt for a more formal affair. good quality  not itchy.
1,I love this t-shirt  i wish it came in tons of other prints! very soft  almost feels lived in  and high quality all the same.
-1,Love the color and overall design of this dress...but it's just going to have to go back. the view from the direct front and back are nice  but froth side the high waist and secure back make me look pregnant. not the look i'm going for especially at this price.    the other oddity is that the white circle design is unfortunately placed! in the back it's all i see which is 'right' on a bulls-eye and the same on the front. i don't know how the designer missed this! it's the only white design on th
-1,I loved the design of this blouse and ordered it the first day it was available. unfortunately  i was disappointed on arrival. besides being more muted color-wise  the sizing is way off. i ordered the xxsp and it was huge on me. on the model  it looks like it skims the body  when in reality  it falls like a tent. i tried tucking it into a skirt  but there was just too much fabric.    though the neck worked for me  i can see how it might be too small for some people as it is very narrow. also  it
0,The top looks like an oversized shirt in the model photo but as you can see it's not at all in person. made with what feels like hospital scrubs-meets-crisp-poplin  this shirt is stiff and does not lay flat against the body. the cut is almost triangular or bell shaped causing it to jut out - think of a flared wide leg pant - but as a shirt. the sleeves have a similar cut as well. i  too  am a 34c and found it made me look much wider as your bust will cause the shirt to move away from you. it's s
-1,"This dress looked great on the hanger  but once on  it did absolutely nothing for me.    navy is one of my most flattering colors  but the navy in the dress did not make up for the yucky second color that was so blah it just reminded me of dirt. that second color made me look drab.    i am 5'8"" with a long torso and wear a size 12 in tts tops and dresses  but the waist on this dress hit at an uncomfortable spot between by waist and ribs. i really needed the waist to be dropped further. or higher"
1,This sweater fits perfect and the pink trim makes it stunning! i was pleasantly surprised when i tried this on. i don't usually pay this much for a cardigan  but the quality and feel are better than usual.
1,I saw this shirt in store a while ago  but could not believe the price and was not about to spend my money on it. however  when it went on sale and there was an extra 40%  i decided to get it. i like the top  it's cute and fun. however  it does poof out a little in the midline. this top goes great with jeans or shorts  and it is cute  but definitely not worth full price for this.
-1,"I purchased the blue s (140lbs  5'8""  34b) and this was very large and boxy on me. not altogether unflattering but not so flattering that it justifies the price. the blue color is very pretty in person--darker and slightly marled. however  although this sweater is certainly cashmere (and very soft because of it)  it is very thin--to the point that i consider this a ""top"" rather than a ""sweater."" the silk panel in back is pretty but  again  thin and unlined. i think that  even on sale  this is ov"
0,This dress is very beautiful - great fabric and colors - but it looked terrible on me because i have large breasts. i am 32dd and this dress made me look pregnant. if you have the right body type it would be a great breezy summer dress. i'm sad because i can't wear it:(
0,I received this top and loved the pattern. however  i ordered both and s and m  and the bust sizing on this top is very odd. i am a 34c  and the bust area was way too big on both  but if i had sized down to the xs the rest of the suit would be too small. maybe it's just made for busty people? also the supportive material in the bust area goes straight across kind of like a bandeau  so that added to the odd look of the bust. it's still a beautiful pattern  so if you're going to give it a try orde
-1,The product looked more or less as expected  but the fabric felt very cheap. not the quality i would expect from retailer. the shirt is also very short  which did not bother me but is something others should be aware of.
1,I'm 5'8  130 and ordered a small. it fits very nice and it's flattering. my daughter doesn't like it as she thinks it looks like a t-shirt tucked into pants. i get that but it fits nicely and i like the pattern and tapered legs.
-1,I was surprised retailer decided to ship this sweater. the sweater looks like it's falling apart and it is huge. i would not recommend this even at a clearance price.
-1,Loved the open shoulders  but not how large and flowy the rest of it was. i could have worn it 9 months preggo ;)
0,The problem with off the shoulder tops is that the neckline is totally elastisized   therefore upon any movement of your arms the top pops above your shoulders making it go from stylish to matronly . the only elastic should be right at the shoulders   the rest of the neckline should be a simple finished hem. .
0,This sweater dress was incredibly soft  and i loved the button detail down the back. unfortunately  i'm an hourglass figure (32dd with 26'' waist). this sweater did nothing to flatter me. i tried it in 2 different sizes; the ps looked far too big on  but the pxs created an awkward baggy area in my midsection while fitting nicely elsewhere. the petite length was great - i am 5'1 and i would not have wanted it any shorter. wish this was a little more tapered in the waist  because the quality is lo
0,I bought this mostly to wear around the house  so i'll keep it because i got it on a pretty good sale.  that said  this runs really large. the sleeves are really loose  and it doesn't really hang well over my hips  which is a shame. it's very soft and cozy  which is nice  but i don't think i'll leave the house in it often. it also arrived with a hole in the ribbing on the bottom of the front panel. i was able to tie a knot through one of the loops that i think will prevent further unraveling  bu
1,I agree with everything the other reviewer stated. this top is very billowy and runs large  it would be nice if i didn't have a chest! the other issue with this top is the macrame detailing is made more out of a satin like material and i wanted it to look closer to natural raw fiber. the pink is slightly more pink in person but it's not that far off. had to return.
0,I should have paid more attention to the reviews of this sweater before ordering. although the material looks soft and cozy in the photo  it's very scratchy and uncomfortable. i was also hoping the opening of the collar would be a little wider  which would have been more flattering on me. i never wear turtlenecks of any kind so i took a chance on this. i'm sure others will look fabulous in this sweater and may be happy with it if they don't mind the texture. i'm sending it back.
0,I wanted this top to fit. i ordered a large and was swimming in it. i returned it to the store where they had it in all sizes. i tried on a medium and it was still too big and then a small that fit but i just did not love it. i did not have trouble with it being cut too low. i think it might look best on someone who is straight up and down and not hourglass since it blouses over the waist. this print is soooo pretty!!
-1,The top is nice  good quality  etc.... but how do you keep the 'off the shoulder' off the shoulder? mine keeps inching up until it's just a boring white top with a strange loose neckline.
-1,I just received this dress wadded up in a bag. it is nothing like the colors shown on line. in the picture it appears blue and white. in actuality it is teal and a funky color of beigey pink. the top is see though but it does see have a slip under the skirt. will be sending it back and again remind myself why i shouldn't try to buy a dress on line.
0,Loved the print on this dress  however the fit wasn't for me.  i feel like it exaggerated my belly  and just overall i didn't feel great in it.  the sleeves were also really big.
1,Loose fitting and comfortable without losing its shape.   looks great on. the tie in front adds to the dress.     i love to wear with tan knee-high boots.
1,This cardigan is a beautiful - not too thin  but soft and versatile. the cutouts add a nice unique detail. i was worried that the cuts might fray  but they actually have a very thin bit of glue to prevent fraying. really beautiful piece for those of us with cold summer offices :)
0,"The fit is definitely more ""straight-leg "" and not skinny  as the photos seem to imply. at 4'11"" and 95 lbs  the size 25 fit my waist and butt wonderfully  and the length was great  but the jean lost shape at the knee. i would recommend these jeans if you are not seeking a skinny fit!"
1,This fit me perfectly with a little room but think it's meant to be this way so easier to get on and off. this feels like a dream and is very good quality. definitely a heavier piece but i like that. it is so very flattering and drapes beautifully to hide my tummy. the back is adorable too! retailer hit it out of park with this one! grab it before it's too late! i'm a 36ddd and size 14 and the large fit perfectly
1,Can't say about fit just yet since it is a gift; color is soft green and versatile. finishing touches around edges and in back make it a stand out sweater that dresses up jeans but also nice over a dress or with skirt
-1,I assumed at the price point this would be a high quality t-shirt/sweater. unfortunately  it is made of cheap looking material that is 50% acrylic and see-through.
-1,"This is a rare review for me  i usually love my retailer purchases  even at times when other reviewers aren't fans  but this top is terrible. 5'4"" 103  32 b for reference  small frame  athletic  bought the xs in black. the length could have been longer  but i could have lived with the length. the arm hole area  however  a different story. because it's boxy  and the fabric is stiffer bc of the large flowers  the top sticks out on the sides under the arm holes leaving a gape  it did not fit snuggly"
1,"I slightly balked at the cost  but i am completely satisfied and glowing about the product  and it is made in the usa. in these times  that means a lot. 100% supima cotton and the perfect design with reasonable deep v-neck  front and back and the slightly lengthened sides  very ultimate design for a tee. i bought the dark grey; the tag says ""wash before wearing""  which is one extra step... still  i find this supima cotton tee pretty much divine. i bought the dark grey in medium  my usual ( size"
-1,This top arrived today  and after trying it on  i wanted to leave a review to say that the shirt is 100% without a doubt pinned back on the model in the product picture. the fit is designed to be loose  so i don't think anyone could possibly get the same look as the model even if they sized down. i've included a picture of how it fits naturally  and a picture of how it fits the model as i hold the fabric back. it's still a cute shirt  just not the flattering top i was expecting. i'm debating on
-1,Similar to others here  these pants were ruined after one wash. the first pair i bought simply faded after one wash  which was okay  but the second pair got weird splotches on the backside. i'd rather not call attention to that particular area of my body;) could've been a great addition to my wardrobe if they were better quality.
1,I am petite and so ordered this top in a petite size and found that it ran large. i am also pretty busty to boot  but found there was more than enough room. the length was still a bit long for me  however it does hit on my where it does on the model. the top is wonderful quality  thick and not see through at all. i am almost tempted to get a regular size and try to wear it as a dress.
-1,There's a reason the model is holding her arms up in all the frontal views. it hides the very weird wide top part of the sleeve that absolutely destroys and distorts an otherwise beautiful blouse. the print is lovely but the fit is very odd. it's pulls at and is very tight through the bust too. i wear medium or large and ordered size large. if you're less well endowed this might be an okay choice for you. but i have to say this blouse made me look overweight and very wide. returned.
-1,I ordered this blouse because it was such a good price on sale but should have paid closer attention to the reviews. the slits on the sleeves are much more noticeable than in the photo and the blouse just didn't work for me. something about it reminded me of seinfeld's pirate shirt. i appreciate retailer's return policy. i took it back to the store and got an immediate refund on my cc.
1,These jeans! i am obsessed. the perfect boyfriend fit with an easy  relaxed feel. i feel instantly cooler when i slip into these. do yourself a favor and buy them!!
0,Super cute top! thin!! would look great layered! not crazy how it looked by itself!
0,I bought these pants in white and tan. they are comfortable and fit great.however  they tend to stretch. i just got them and they are already starting to become uncomfortably loose. i still really like them but i recommend you buy a little tight so they become comfortable.
0,"There is no back zip on this skirt and therefore it does not lay flat as it would if there were a zip. instead it has an elastic waist. it is very nice quality but i never would have purchased this skirt if i knew it had an elastic waist. i am 5'6"" and a size 6. it runs a bit large - i think this is due to the elastic waste."
0,"This dress is very cute! i loved it. the quality is excellent. however  the fit is off. i'm 5""1  107lbs  32c. this dress was roomy in the bust and was a little too broad shouldered. it was tight around the waist. this caused creasing and buldging in the back. the color is much more vibrant in person. i would have kept it  if it fit properly."
1,I saw this tee and was unsure about the print  but decided to give it a try. i'm glad i did  as it has become a weekend staple.
0,Picked this up in the store today  but didn't try it on first. it is even more gorgeous in person than the photo  but sadly this did not work for me when i got it home to try on. there is wonderful detailing  but somehow the bulky knit fit was just not flattering on. i think it is the thick knit and slightly shorter length. the knit was bulking up in all the wrong places and visually added about 10l bs to my frame. such a shame---really wanted to keep this beautiful sweater but it just did not l
-1,The print is very pretty but the fabric is stiff and it runs way too big.  looks great on the model but awful on me.
1,I love the way this fits and feels on. it is a beautiful piece and makes me happy to wear. i ordered my usual size medium and it fits well. the only con is that it is dry clean only.
-1,I love this shirt  love love love it. i am a curvy girl and it accents all the right features and hides the ones that need to be hidden. but i've owned it for 6 months and there are already 4 holes in the shirt. and not holes in the fabric but holes on the seam lines. the stitching is not sturdy enough for the shirt to not fall apart. the whole point is to be able to wear it. but now i have to bust out my sewing machine to reinforce the seams that split so that i can wear it again. :(
-1,This dress looks like it could be cute on but when you put it on its just blah. i saw someone else trying it on in the fitting room and she felt the same. not cute  not flattering  the model photo is deceiving. would not recommend  although it looks airy and comfy.
-1,When the top arrived and i tried it on; it was great. the length was perfect even though i am curvy. after one wash (done according to the directions)  the top shrank in length considerably. i do not mind paying a higher price for something unique and something of quality.....i do have a problem with something that does not hold up to basic use. i will be returning this item.
-1,After reading all the reviews and sizing down one size. i got my top size m  i usually wear m/l depending on the style. i'm 6 ft tall  160 lb  i like my clothing loose but not as loose as this top. i should have gone to xxxxxs if such exists. no wonder there is such a low leap in price. it is a good quality though  and very nice pale peach color. no would not recommend  unless you wear 3xxxl
1,It is a perfect weight and length. it's a great dress. i did need to have the waist altered bc it is a straight fit.
0,I love the look and feel of  this easy dress. i loved that it comes with a baby blue slip  however i was in between sizes. the medium - a bit too small and the large- just too big. this dress is probably best in a tall thin body type  especially in a madras plaid.
0,I loved how the skirt looked on the model  but when i tried in on it had no shape on me. i usually wear a size 6 and received a size 4 which was large on me. also  the material feels rough which i was not expecting as it is advertised as a silk skirt. i was really looking forward to wearing this skirt but it is just not i thought it was - i expect better quality from retailer.
0,I wanted to love this dress but the sizing was too large for me  overwhelming my frame. i am very petite; for reference  5'2  24 waist  30  and usually get an xxsp or 00p but even the 00p was too large in both the waist and especially in the shoulder area. at minimum for fit  i would have had to have the dress taken up but required too much alteration. the skirt is not lined which i found disappointing  given the price. the colors and handkerchief like hem is really cute though but i returned.
1,It is a little boxy  but it?s not unflattering in my opinion. the sweatshirt material is soft  the ruffles keep their shape and position  and aren?t too overwhelming on my small frame. i like the small slits on the sides  they allow the sweater to drape nicely. it also hit at a flattering spot  a little below the hip. 5?1??  100 lbs  and got the xxs petite. this fit true to size for me.
1,I love this! i will sport it in the spring with white capris/ leggings and awesome for a beach cover-up! the fit is comfy the embroidery gives it a feminine touch. i purchased the large but could've gotten away with a slender fit in medium. i am 5'4 170 lbs.
1,I highly recommend this dress!!!!!! i was a little nervous about purchasing this dress online because previous reviewers were saying that it creates static  but nothing that a little static guard couldn't prevent! :) i purchased a medium petite and i am about 5 feet tall  usually a size 8 in dresses and it fit perfect! (wore for thanksgiving) the fabric and style are very forgiving and the dress sort of flows with you when you walk  which i love!!
1,The sweater is as cute in person as it is online.
0,Love the print and comfort of this tank  however  it does run about 2 sizes larger than normal. it is also not a fitted tank  it has some flow which is not exactly what i was looking for.
1,This top is really pretty & i think i will be happy when i pull it out in the spring to wear it. the only complaint is that the front is very sheer. you have to wear an under shirt of some kind.
1,Love the design (i got the blue and green one). it was more see-through than i thought but the pattern covers it so it doesn't matter what color bra you wear.
1,This dress is really pretty  but not made for girls with hips. i tried on my usual size 6 and it fit everywhere but was just slightly too tight in the bum for me to feel comfortable  but i feel like i would have been swimming everywhere else in the dress in an 8 (typical of shifts i guess  but a girls can dream!). if you are a straighter shape  though  i would highly recommend.
0,You guys  i love this so much! however  within one hour of wearing it  the back seam completely ripped. it fit me perfectly... sadly i&#39;ll have to return the damaged item. really sad it&#39;s all sold out too!
-1,I wanted to love this dress. i ordered online and what you cannot see in the picture if the pleating on the dress. i ordered a medium  i am usually a large in retailer and the medium looked like a tent. i realize this should be loose fitting but it was huge.
0,I liked this top but found it to be a little dowdy. fit was slightly boxy and not a good look for me. may look better on a different body type.

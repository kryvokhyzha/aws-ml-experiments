-1,I wanted to love this sweatshirt  but alas  it is going back. upon opening and unfolding  the first thing i noticed: the dots and not solid. they are sort of distressed looking  with parts of them missing. secondly  it doesn't have a lot of structure. it's soft and kind of floppy but in a weird way. it's just not flattering on me. it looks more like a pajama top than something i would wear out of the house. for reference  i ordered the 3  and i'm usually a 10/12 in tops.
0,The green color was beautiful but the top was too low cut and looked more maternity than boho.
1,This dress first caught my eye online. due to the price i resisted. then i saw in store and tried on...i decided to hold off for a sale  but my will was getting thin. once i saw it start to sell out online  i had to take the plunge. i knew this dress was a must have. it is super flattering and comfy! the best of both worlds. i'm small-chested so both the s and m fit  but the seam on the s fit a bit higher  which was more flattering on me  so s is what i got. it can be dressed up or slightly down
0,Beautiful and good quality dress. the pictures nor the description really show or mention the keyhole cut at the front neckline.  you really have to look very closely at the model photos to see it.  unlike the model  i have curves and this dress showed way too much cleavage for me.
-1,I wanted to love this blouse so much. but try as i might  it just fit so oddly on me. i'm usually a petite s so i purchased the xs in brown. first. the color was more gray-brown but it was still ok. but second  the fit was off. maybe i just got a bad one  but the center of the blouse was so offset  that the slit in the front laid so far to the left and the v-neck was so low that you could see my bra - there was no adjusting i could do to fix it. the material has a lovely soft silky feel to it an
1,I really love this top. it looks great under a black tahari suit that i wear to work. the neckline looks really nice. the only negatives are that it's a bit sheer  so i have to wear a tank under it and it's a little wide. it looks fine tucked in or hanging out with jeans for a more casual look. i'd recommend this top  especially if you can get it on sale. pretty true to size. i'm 5'4''  120 pounds  and a 32 c and the size 4 top fit me nicely.
-1,I bought this top on sale - very glad i did not pay full price for it! i wash everything before i wear it. when it dried i saw that there was a grease spot on the back and a small hole on one upper arm - i will probably be able to take care of the grease spot  but the hole will be a little trickier  as the material is kind of filmy.
-1,This dress looks and feels cheap. the white material is stiff and does not iron nicely. the grey sweater is super thin and very cheap looking. overall  a pretty horrible dress. save your money 
1,Love this dress. fits true to size!! can be dressed up or down. very flattering1 prettier in person
1,This dress is stunning. i have been stopped in the street by people asking where the dress is from. my only complaint is that it was very wrinkled when i bought it. initially i thought it was supposed to be that way  but after seeing the stock photos i realized it needed to be ironed. it took a long time to iron all of the wrinkles out  but it is totally worth it.
0,I wanted to love this top. i really did. the color is beautiful  the embroidery is well done  the fabric is soft  and it feels like it would be very comfortable in the summer heat. but the armholes are big and so the holes show my bra which is not good. i guess i could wear a bandeau or tank underneath  but the armholes just kind of ruined my love for this top. i think i will try again and order next size down.
0,Cute design for a casual top. however it was a little snug on the bust for a medium. i returned it
-1,"This top looks great on the model -- a petite frame  small-busted body.  i am 5'2"" and have a large bust and curvy hips. this top hit in all the wrong places. the front looks very cropped and frumpy  if you have a large bust. the width of the top of very boxy.  the top is very soft and comfortable and the color is pretty."
0,I love the look and feel of these shorts - typically my issue with any sort of cotton or linen shorts these days is that they're practically made of nothing  but these are comfortable and made of decent fabric. however  they run very large. being 100 lbs and about 5'  i typically buy size 0 or xs  but these looked a bit ridiculous on me  with how big they are. i tried shrinking them in the wash  since they're 100% cotton  and that helped some  along with getting rid of the creases from shipping
1,Easy breezy top that goes with so many outfits. i am petite (5'0''  115lb)  but like the longer look of a top  so went with 4r  thought that the arm holes would be too small if went with 2r. there is a lot of excess material around the sides...and back. i was tempted to return  but the armhole issue prevented me and it was so cute  i kept it. i think it will go through the a few seasons (seattle is unpredictable weather-wise...) and can be easily layered. i like the blouse...but don't love.
0,Not keeping this one. the fabric is a bit tacky-looking in person  the cut is odd and it's just not me. fit is fine and there are snaps to keep the neckline flat and shaped  the colors are as shown and it is a good length (falls to top of hip). i simply did not like it. too metallic looking maybe...
-1,"I tried on an xs and it was boxy/roomy in the torso and the pocket on the wrist/forearm area made my arm look too bulky when i rolled the sleeves up like the model pictured. i love the idea of a relaxed fit cropped leather jacket in a versatile taupe color but when i tried this one on in person  it took me back to my childhood. i used to help my dad wash his cars when i was a kid and he used a leather chamois (""shammy"" for short) that was awesome for soaking up water. and that's what it felt lik"
0,Probably should have returned this but it's just so pretty. i got complements from strangers the very first time i wore it but it's extremely long. tucking it in will be tough-where do you put all that length? aside from that it is beautiful. the embroidery is soft and delicate light blues  gold  neutrals. hard to see in the pic but there are textured polka dots all over the shirt. great buy-i just wonder how i'll wear it or if the length will be too much and it will become a 'closet sitter'.
0,These are cute and light weight however the fit is off. i ordered my normal size large (i'm a 12/14.). the waist was large but fit ok. they were really tight across the theighs. the crop length is fine with my 5'9 height. if i hadn't got such a good sale of probably return them. they will be good lounge pants.
0,I was excited to try this on in the store today. the zipper details on the shoulder are really cute and the ribbing pattern is flattering. i was disappointed when i put it on though because it fits like a baby-doll / pregnancy top. it's snug around the bust  and then flares out pretty widely through the lower half. you can't really see that on the model. i was hoping it was more of a fitted tee  but sadly  that wasn't the case.
0,"I tried this dress on in the store. it looked frumpy. the ruching was not flattering. the fabric felt cheap. i think for the price there are plenty of other options for dresses than can give you a ""wow"" look. i'm 5'1"" 107lbs and the 0p fit fine."
-1,I usually love bordeaux so i was very disappointed with this shirt when it arrived. the fabric smelled plastic-y which is a first for me with retailer products. when i put the shirt on  i could see it had that sheen that comes from rayon spandex blend shirts  i hadn't noticed that it had spandex in it when i ordered it. this fabric looks and feels exactly like the cheap blends sold at discount stores. i can't believe retailer is selling this.
1,This is a super comfortable and flattering dress and i get compliments every time i wear it! highly recommend!
0,The shirt is mostly a thick sweatshirt material and is very short when trying on - undershirt required to make up for length and the see through mesh in the pattern.  felt about 1 size too small as well
-1,The color of this dress is gorgeous and i really wanted to love it. but  it was awful. i am 5'9'' and the length was fine. the problem is the lack of shape which made me look 50 - 100 lbs heavier than i am. it would make a great maternity dress since that is what it already looks like.
0,Ordered size 12  it fits but pulls a tiny bit in the midsection. also way too long  hits below my knees. the dress is beautiful: crisp black color  nice fabric  great neck. it's also the kind of dress that must fit well to look good. i had to return mine.
0,I thought this would be so clean looking  in a theory/vince. menswear way  but unfortunately the cut of the coat is super unflattering. i waiver between a 2 and a 4 at retailer and erred on the side of caution and went with the 4. the shoulders are way off the mark  sleeves are too long  and the button hits about 3 inches too low. it's just...baggy...in a way that the size itself is not the issue. alas  this is going back  and my search for the perfect coat continues!
-1,This shirt was just really missing something for me. i originally liked the patter of the small dots all over the fabric  especially with the sleeves being more sheer than the rest of the blouse. i also am tending to gravitate toward clothes that hide my residual baby fat in my midsection. however  the tie is very high up on the neck and it made me feel like i was wearing a turtleneck. i rarely wear turtle necks because they make me feel like i am choking. in addition  the bow seemed to be too t
1,This dress is slightly tight on me and i usually wear petite 00 or xxs (5'1 100 lbs) the quality of the fabric is thick and texture  colors are just like the photo  and it has a nice satin like underlining in a dark navy. the snug fit of the dress makes it so i don't need a bra  which is nice especially for a day dress !
0,Maybe it's just that it's a bath robe  but i'm not crazy about how this falls. it is very soft  cozy  and cute  though.
1,The lace front is more detailed than i expected  but in a good way. the sleeves are softer on the outside  but the inside is not too scratchy as others have said  in my opinion. it is comfy but i feel that the lace part is fragile and i will need to be mindful of where i'm sitting when wearing it. not a deal breaker though...
1,I never write reviews and i do a ton of online shopping but i had to write how amazing this dress is. so happy with this purchase. totally worth every penny! it fits like a dream- the rouching on the side is so pretty and i love the full coverage at the top. such he pretty colors too. perfect dress!!!
1,Love this blouse. per the previous review  there was no problem with my tailoring. it is exactly as shown. i plan to handwash this and take super good care of it. you can tell from the picture it could be an excellent wardrobe staple and absolutely timeless as well as the kind of sexy and elegant you can get away with in the office.  i do think it runs a tiny bit small. however  it is not short. it's just quite a fitted piece. i would consider sizing up. i love the look of the medium on me  5'10
1,This is a beautiful  light-weight summer top. i ordered the white - perfect for summer. very feminine. true to size. i am 117 5'3 34b and the x-small fit perfectly.
-1,This runs super big and it just wasn't flattering--way too much fabric. i wanted to love this dress.
1,Kind of excited about this little number. i found it online and was immediately drawn to the boho-chic look. it arrived and i was impressed with the weight of the dress and the detailing that is missed in the photo.
1,Regarding the product  high quality materials and overall make. extremely comfortable and flattering cut. i'd love this in all the colors of the rainbow.
1,I absolutely love this dress! i wore it with taupe tights and suede boots and got so many compliments. i have also worn it over leggings  and can see myself wearing it in the warmer months with sandals. even though the material is somewhat thin  i did not have to wear a cami with it. the fabric pattern is really cute!
1,Love  love love this top. it's got a little bit of a native american vibe without being over-the-top. i tend to wear a small in retailer  but the medium was the way to go for me. it's not long  and the style errs on the not-tight side. if you can go between two sizes  don't get the smaller one. and i love the shade of yellow!
-1,"I saw this dress worn on the street and thought it was lovely  the perfect work dress. i then found it in the store and my size was already sold out  so i visited another retailer  and another to find it. unfortunately the color blocking on the chest was not very flattering for me  it seemed to overly accentuate it. i am 5'9"" a 36 dd size 12. the colors  the fabric are all wonderful. but this dress is not for me."
-1,The colors are so much brighter than pictured. although the sweater is very comfortable  i did not like the color combination. i will be returning it.
1,Great alternative to yoga pants  these pants are stylish and on-trend but also easy going. dress them up or throw on a hoodie and your look is instantly transformed with very little effort!
0,I loved the style and shape of the dress . it does run small. i had to return it because some of the black dots pulled and looked like it might be more of a problem as i wore it
-1,I'm 5'4  115 and the xs swallowed me like a snuggie. i suppose the tons of fabric might drape nicely if you're 5'8 and above? it drooped and hung comically large from every angle under arm  body and skirt. a belt was no match for that much fabric. the colors are gorgeous and it appeared well made  but the design was awful.
-1,Sleeves were tight  was difficult to put on ?. for the price  you want to love the shirt. sending it back.
0,The fit is a little bit odd  it is short and wide  too much fabric. the quality is not good  the buttons can easily break and the stitching was falling apart. i am returning it.
-1,Bought a large  could barely pull up over my butt. runs extremely small. it's cute but if your not a stick figure  this is not the suit for you.
1,"This skirt is a beautiful fabric  heavy and soft  and fully lined. it has two sets of snaps on the inside so you can adjust the waist size. i purchased a medium  but found that there wasn't enough of an overlap in the split to be decent (it flaps open when i walk  revealing nearly everything!)  so i will be exchanging for a large. for reference  i typically wear a size 10 or 12 in pants and skirts. the color is true to the photos  with a matte finish. i am 5'8"" and length hit me below the knee."
-1,I tried on this jumpsuit in black and it was absolutely beautiful. i liked that it looked sort of like a tuxedo  i wore it one time and received so many compliments. when i washed it  however  it shrunk almost 1 size! the pant legs were high water. i even tried washing and restretching it because i loved the jumpsuit but it wouldn't budge  i think because rayon is not stretchable material. to my disappointment  i returned it. i really wished it would have worked out.
-1,I loved how this looked on the model  however  once i tried on in store  i was greatly disappointed. i usually wear a meduim and the small and extra-small were huge on me. there was so much extra material that i was swimming in this. i had such high hopes for this. there were no petite sizes to try on in the store but i am not sure it would have helped.
0,The fabric  so diaphanous! so flowy! the pattern  so pretty with such interesting colors. it could literally go with anything! purple  yellow  orange  green  they're all in there. but here's the but....    i have no waist! and when you put this type of empire silhouette on me  i look like i'm wearing a sack  or i have some pregnancy news--when i don't. i tried belting it : waist tie is too high; i tried putting on a vest  too annie hall and called too much attention to the sleeves  while adding
0,Facing the mirror--near perfection. high waist emphasizes the narrowest part of the frame--pleats nicely hide any stomach flaws. color is an eye-catching deep mustardy perfection and the interlocking button pattern is creative and beautiful. the problem is the walk away. from that view  the skirt waist finishes just where there's a bit of extra flesh. the cut is more of a long a-line--fairly boxy--and the heaviness of the cotton maintains that structure  so while the look as you approach walking
1,Love these pants. got them in yellow- gold color. pair them with retailer anafa tiered top which also has some yellow tones to it. goes lovely. good quality. important for me - the color is soft  not overly bright yellow  fabric is soft as well. great fit.!
-1,"I was so excited to receive this top!!! the material and design is gorgeous but it is way way way too short!!! i'm 5'7"" with an hourglass shape/average build and it barely hit the top of my pants! it otherwise fit true to size. so disappointed!!!! and for the price  it really should be cut better."
1,"I love sweater knit dresses and this the first one i've owned with a flare style that works. pattern placement is gorgeously done and is very slimming in a non-obvious way. i think the fabric is soft and warm. i wish the scoop neckline was a tad bit higher from a modesty standpoint. you may want to size down if you're not busty. i am 5'3"" and m petite was the perfect length on me. shout out to the reno distribution center for getting this amazing dress to me in 1.5 days?!?!?!!!"
-1,The dress is extremely high quality! i purchased the dress in black. the white collared shirt that the model is wearing under the dress is not part of the dress. the dress overall is like a balloon. unless you're extremely tall and skinny this dress makes you look bigger! i ordered the small petite and am 125 lbs and 5'4. i really wanted to like this dress but unfortunately it's going back:( the petite hits 3 inches above the knee for reference.
-1,This shirt has absolutely no shape. look carefully at the model and you we discover she is cleverly positioned to hide the sheer boxy-ness of this shirt. the print is beautiful but it looks like a maternity shirt. i even ordered the xs at 5'7 and 130 lbs but found it too baggy. returned.
1,"These jeans fit pretty well on my petite frame  although wish they were more cropped. for reference i am 5'4"" 110 lbs. i was looking for frayed jeans for this fall and these jeans are on trend. i may look at petite options which would be truly cropped. overall they are very stretchy skinny jeans and have a nice dark wash."
1,I loved this top  however had to return as it does run small. by the time it arrived they were sold out in the larger size. like the quality of cloth and stone  however their products do run a size small.
0,The fabric is super soft and comfortable and the look is cute  however the drape on the front crossover is not great and doesn't flatter well. the shorts will probably run a little on the short side for some - i'm very short (5') and the length is great for me but i'm guessing not for the average height.
-1,"I wanted to love this dress  but it has too many flaws. first  the ""waistband"" falls right under the bust and the skirt flares out from there. not a flattering silhouette.. second  the fabric is a sickly yellow-beige netting that looks like burlap. third  i can't imagine what kind of bra you can wear under it. on the plus side  the fabric isn't scratchy."
1,This.  an unexpected purchase...i found this on my way to the dressing room.  the fit is stunning. i sized way down (i.e. normally wear 10/12  curvy  and bought a small).  it accentuates my curves  and is incredibly flattering. i bought the navy  and will be adding another color soon!  the material is viscose blend - soft and flowy. it's a nice addition to my work wardrobe.
1,"I bought this in both the black motif and the ivory. i got a size 2 and i would say it is true to size. the fabric is very comfortable and doesn't wrinkle easily. it does have a ""flowy"" look to it but i didn't find that it had too much fabric. i wouldn't tuck it in though. i find it looks really good with skinny jeans/pants and i love throwing a cardigan over it for cooler days. the details in the double buttons and on the back are really cute and make it more unique. i recommend the shirt."
-1,If you have any curves  avoid! it is not flattering.  the striped side panels look odd with the flow of the dress.
0,I waited and got this sweater at the winter sale. i ordered the navy in a medium. the design is pretty  but as has been said  i was surprised at how short it is. i do love the detail  the tie back. nice weight. i have not found it to be itchy. the sweater i received was a store return  and it was a little wrinkled and fuzzy  but for $35 i considered my hunt for the perfect navy pullover to be over. i do need to wear a cami underneath  as the sides are more revealing than pictures. the first day
0,This top light and airy  which is perfect for spring. i'm usually into these types of blouses; however  this didn't quite fit right on me. it's a little too boxy and too low cut in the front for some reason. i loved the design and really wanted to like it... i just didn't love it enough to purchase it.
-1,Didn't like at all. itchy fabric  looked good on model but on on busty girl.
0,"I was very excited to try out this dress. i've been looking for a velvet dress for a couple of years now  and.. i'm not digging this one. the fabric itself was a let down right off the bat. it's cheap looking to me. i've seen nice velvet and this is very shiny  thin  and slightly sheer! the dress cut itself is what i was expecting  a loose baby doll type dress. the length hit above my knees. the overall effect made me feel very ""gypsy-ish""...my husband gave a firm no! when he saw me walk out of"
0,"This dress arrived today in such a crumpled and wrinkled state that i was reluctant to even try it on. it is on the large size  but fine if you are looking for a very flowing look. longer at the front than shown in the photograph and i am 5'9"". i am sending it back. it is a pretty fabric  although shinier than expected. i am just not prepared to spend so much time pressing and steam ironing this item every time i want to wear it."
0,I really loved how this top looked and was really excited it to get it on sale. i was worried that it might be too small/tight (i ordered a m and would consider myself a m) but was relieved to find it fit just fine. i was extremely disappointed to find that it was too sheer to wear by itself and still showed my bra with a layering tank on underneath. it was also more like a crop top for length  which does not work with my mama belly.

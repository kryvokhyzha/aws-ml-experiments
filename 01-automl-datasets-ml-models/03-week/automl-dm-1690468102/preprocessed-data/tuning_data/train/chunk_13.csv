0,I ordered this to arrive at my store and was so excited to try it on. it was soft and cuddly  but a little baggy under the arms  and it shed everywhere. underwhelmed.
-1,I buy almost ever top tiny puts out and so i grabbed this one in the last tops sale since i'm a sucker for embroidered flowers. everything about it is gorgeous except it is so flimsy i can't even believe it. like when i held it up in the dressing room  i could see through the entire shirt  front to back  before even putting it on. once on  i could see everything through it. i actually thought i was going to tear the thing to pieces trying it on  it's so frail. i own so many tiny shirts and while
1,"Only thing is the fit is a little loose  so i wish the xxs petite wasn't sold out (or that there was a xxs#. at 115 lbs  i tried on e xs regular  that made the skirt a maxi on me #5'1.5""# and it was nice  but a bit loose. i would have worn it as a sexy strapless #i tried it  just not daring enough to actually wear it like that). so i ordered the xs petite  we shall see.    the navy and beige is a nice classy combo  i could see it being pulled off in all seasons  depending how you pair it."
-1,I read the cleaning instructions label carefully. followed them closely. and still  the dye ran and stained some of my colored clothes. pi**ed me off! just after the first wash and even before wearing them  i have streaks of uneven color on the pants. bad quality material or dye is what causes this. now i have to go and see if i can even get out my other stained clothes. thanks a lot retailer.
1,The color and fabric are really soft and lovely. it runs big so you can get away with a size smaller of even 2 sizes smaller. it would look great paired with leggings and boots and a long sweater coat or with skinny jeans and sandals. this is going to be my new favorite.
0,I am a true size small and i ordered this dress and it was way big. it's meant to be a relaxed fit  but it sagged under the arm-holes because the bust was way too big. some folks are saying it ran small and they are essentially the same measurements as me  so it makes me think there is possibly some variation in each size. i got on here to reorder in a smaller size  but now am not sure what to do as i need a dress with in the next three days!
-1,I've been looking for the perfect white eyelet maxi  feels like a perfect summer staple...but sadly this was not it. quality isn't great which is surprise on a $168 price tag. top of dress is lined but cheaply so it's somewhat see through. the dress was returned.
1,Like other reviewers  i'm glad i sized down. this is a cute tunic that is definitely great quality  lightweight chambray. i love that it has pockets  but they do puff a bit at my hips.
1,Absolutely love this dress! i ended up wearing it backwards to work for a more modest neckline  but flipped it around for an evening night out. can't recommend it enough - two of my colleagues ordered it that day.
-1,My personal opinion is that i am not a fan of this top  the material of the fabric doesn't seem as nice as delettas other tops and it had a really boxy fit on me. i wanted to love this top but i did not.
0,Beautiful color; however  the fabric did not work for me. tight on top  large on bottom.
0,"I ordered the neutral and this dress feels and looks great. but my issue is with the fabric. while very comfortable  it fades where its stretched. so around my bust and my back when i moved my arms. i am 5'9""  145 lbs and the small fit me the best but i tried on the medium just to see if it was a fit issue. the fabric still looked weird. i'm disappointed to send it back but i just can't keep it."
-1,I loved the design and look to this shirt  but it ran way big for me. i loved the forgiving fit  but it just wasn't flattering at all. i even went down one size and it still was huge. sad to send this one back.
-1,Tried this on in store. was ill-fitting and sheer.
0,I can usually be counted on to love a pretty top with lace detail and a bit of flow. this one has those qualities but it does not look great on me. perhaps it is too flowy because i am 5?3. or possibly the fabric is too soft a look on me. i did size down as reviewers suggested. maybe one size was not enough :-). i must return it.
-1,The sweater was nice but not as long as on the model. it was itchy also. this sweater was not what i had expected. their was nothing exceptional about it to spend that kind of hard earned cash  sorry retailer. i sent it back .
1,"This dress is perfect for the summer  very lightweight  has pockets and not to short lounging around. it is loose fitting  so i normally wear a size 10 or m and 5'6"" tall  but had to order this dress in a s. the small fits me perfectly."
0,I wanted to love this dress so badly. it came and the material is beautiful  but when i put it on it fit so awkwardly. there was just no way to make it look good. maybe i needed a smaller size  but oh well.
1,Gave this sweater to my mom this christmas and she has hardly taken it off...so cozy and cute!
1,I really liked these leggings  so comfy! they are so soft and the waistband is thick(about an inch wide). i am a size 10 in pants  i got a size m. i have a 33 inch inseam and these came down to my ankles. these leggings have textured stripes at the calf and hip.
-1,I really wanted to like this dress and was so disappointed when it came in the mail. if you have any sort of hips  the light pattern in the middle doesn't do you any favors. this made my hips look soooo wide! and the seaming and gathering in the middle was just off. if it was one continuous piece of fabric it might look better. with the seam  the pattern was cut up and looked pieced together. that just drew too much attention to my stomach and hips. it had to go back.
0,Lovely palette and and fabric but the cut did not flatter my shape. the flowy cut broadened my silhouette and hit at my waist making me look bigger than i actually am. the overall effect was quite frumpy in spite of the flamboyant pattern. perhaps a better choice for someone built exactly like the model.  i will be returning it.
-1,I was in love with this suit from the pictures. unfortunately the top is a little too short so the peplum skirt hits right at my widest part and doesn't meet the bikini bottoms.
-1,When i tried this top on  i started laughing. the two rows of ruffles are made of a starchy thick cotton  which  instead of falling by the hips  juts out like wings. it's also huge. cute idea  wrong material and placement.
-1,"The dress was just too ill fitting and bulky and large. it was more matronly looking then anything and did not fit well. if you are going to try it  probably size down 2 sizes. for reference  i'm 5'4"" and 124 lbs. i bought my normal size 4 and it was very large. i would not recommend as it's just not flattering. i love one shoulder dresses and tops so was very disappointed as i'm an retailer devotee...."
0,I really like the color and flow of this dress. the dress itself fit well however the slip was extremely tight through the bust. i have a large bust at 34d however most dresses are still wearable especially flowy dresses. unfortunately i had to return this one because of the slip.
0,Cute dress but not for me.  the waist is too high and the sleeves are tight.  maybe on a different body type this dress would be perfect.  i returned it.
1,I saw this on a mannequin at the store and was instantly drawn in by all the beautiful blue lace and the overall design. however  when i tried it on  i personally found a few things that just didn't work for me:  ____________  pros:  - blue lace is lovely throughout  nicely done.  - there's a little snap closure at the front of the dress where the fabric overlaps at the bra cups. i can only assume it's to make it easier to get the dress on. it's a nice little detail  although not sure if really
0,These ran very small compared to other charlie pants i've bought in the past. even sizing up  the stripes were not flattering. the lady in the next dressing room over tried them on  too  and had the same feeling i did. the less curvy you are  the better stripes look. they more curvy you are  the less flattering stripes on pants look. the way the stripes come together at the seams just isn't flattering.
1,When i saw another shopper holding up this dress for assessment in my local retailer store  i knew i had to have it! i bought it in the red color and it is gorgeous. the fit was perfect...very flattering style. it can be dressed up or down depending on shoes and jewelry  or boots and a scarf! the detail of the scalloped v in the back is a beautiful addition. perfect for the holidays or even dinner out with friends! beautiful dress!
-1,I loved this t-shirt when i first tried it on: a good cut--not too drapey or fitted. but then i washed it (laid flat to dry) and it shrunk so much that it's unwearable now. so disappointing.
1,Oh my! this dress fits wonderfully on! so ready for autumn! i have a big bust  this dress does not split at the buttons.
1,This is the jacket i've been looking for! i love the collar/lapels - they can lay flat or be worn up a bit. the material is really soft so the jacket is comfy and soft. the sleeves are of a ribbed material that makes the jacket even softer and more comfy. i got the black but it's really more of a charcoal black vs. jet black. the color/dye is saturated and dense so there is no sheen to the material ensures that it will be colorfast. when zipped it's form fitting but not tight (tts - i'm 120 lbs 
-1,I bought this top in black. it is high quality material and i love the mock neck and zipper in back.  however  not only are the armholes are too large  the shirt is cut too short. if i size down for smaller armholes  it becomes a crop top  not a flattering look for 50-something me. i really wanted this to work  but alas  it went back.
-1,I purchased these in january and today i am going back to retailer to request a refund; the fabric on the inner thighs are absolutely thread bare. i am 5'6 and wear a size 28. they fit comfortably with great stretch  but apparently the fabric is so cheap that if your thighs should happen to touch  you will wear holes through the thighs in very short order.    first they started piling  which i had never a pair of pilcro pants do before  and within 2 washes i could actually see through the f
-1,I bought this dress because i saw it in stores when it first came to retailer. it was stunning. the colors were vivid and the beading was intricate. i regretted not purchasing it immediately.       fast forward to today... the dress i received was not the one that was originally in stores. the fabric was different  there was hardly any beading  and the colors were washed out and dull.     i read previous reviews saying that the dress was more like the studio pictures than the original promo. but t
1,These leggings are so comfortable and luxurious.  when i opened the package i knew i was in trouble.  they are comfortable and beautiful.  a perfect piece for any wardrobe.
0,Looks great from the front  but from the side it looks like a maternity top.
-1,I sized down as other reviewers suggested (usually an 8  went down to 6) and the dress fit fine--but it was not attractive. the cut was like a tent with an empire waist. really just not attractive. maybe it has to do with my body type  but compared to the model  this dress was so unflattering in-person. returned.
1,I just ordered this item and wore it yesterday. received compliments from my friends. truly a great sweater. feels soft to the touch. i love the cut and how it falls around my hips. sleeves were nice and long. i am a tall lady with long arms. almost 6 ft  weighing about 155. i got the med which was a perfect fit for me. love the off white. almost thinking of getting the peachy pink too.
1,I had been looking for a green jacket with a hood just like this one and was thrilled to find it. i found the fit to be true to size. i am 5'4  107 pounds and i bought the xs  which is my usual size in retailer jackets. i love the material and the way it hangs so casually.
1,I wasn't immediately attracted to this shirt  but decided to try it on. i loved it on!  it is comfortable and very flattering. i'm a small person  and the length wasn't overbearing on me. it was full  but the stitching around the chest gives it shape and is flattering to a smaller chested person. i'm not sure how it works on a fuller person  but my guess is it may surprise you!
-1,I read all the reviews and was hoping that this top would work for me  but it did not. i ordered a size smaller than usual and it was still way too big. it was not flattering at all on my curvy frame. overall  it looked more like a maternity top on me then anything else! if you're tall and slender  i think this top would work!
0,I expected better from this top  it is thin  will snack easy  and you have to wear a cami underneath. for the price  not worth it. definitely returned!
0,I wanted to love this jacket. so soft and great color. unfortunately it is just too light weight. it is almost like shirt fabric. nice heft to the fabric though. nice length - accept the sleeves were short on me. i am 5'10 and 135lbs. the small was the right size. i was looking for something slightly warmer to layer.
1,Saw this skirt in the sale room and figured i'd give it a try. i'm always looking for comfortable skirts that aren't too tight around the waist. once i zipped it up  i knew it would be a keeper! the waist band is super comfortable and it has a hook/eye closure as well. the material is a little heavier weight  but that's fine it can work for winter as well. it's soft  yet structured. the pockets are always a plus. if you want to step away from the normal shapes and colors  this is out of the box
0,"Like the idea of this longer tee/tunic to wear with leggings but i found it not flowly enough in my regular retailer size ( small). fit on top but not really on the bottom with the side slits. unflattering how the slits hit me. maybe for some one taller ( i am 5'3"")."
0,This top reminded me of a maternity top. cute  but better suited for someone smaller chested.
-1,Completely oversized top  size medium was swimming on me.....boxy  baggy  shapeless -- what more can i say? even in an xs this would not have fit in any way like the photo  returned.
1,"This tunic dress is an easy ""go to"" outfit. it looks put together immediately. it is soft and comfortable. i ordered the regular xs even though typically i prefer petite sizing. this dress is above my knees in the front. i am 5'4"" and weight about 118#. i would have ordered a petite size but had previously tried this on in the store and knew the regular sizing was a good fit for me. in the store i tried the taupe color which seemed a bit see through. i ordered the green and it is a lovely shade."
-1,I love the color of this dress. it is not flattering  even though it should be. the weird panels of different materials makes it hang super funky. the lace is heavy but the silky panels aren't. so not flattering  it's just odd. and the fit is super huge  you are swimming in it in addition to a poor body drape. it could have been so cute  but was executed so poorly.
-1,I ordered a size smaller prr other reviewers but that still didn't prepare me for the sweater's issues. it looks really cute but the quality is pretty horrendous. i wore it for the first time today and already the sweater is pilling a lot on my back. seriously heartbroken.
0,"This shirt looks nice on the model  but it felt stiff and unflattering on me. i am 5'5""  135lbs  34c  and the size 4 fit overall. i just didn't happen to like it on me."
-1,I was so sad not to love this dress. it is beautiful  but is so unflattering on. there is a lot of material under the arms and it gathers up due to the smocking. so  it just made me look incredibly frumpy. i don't really think a petite would have helped - the gathers just bunch a bit and so rather than hang  the dress sort of clumps. i am lean but broad shouldered and maybe that is the problem  but i was super disappointed. narrow shouldered people with long torsos could pull this off. it is a t
1,I absolutely love the print. it's what caught my eye first when scrolling down the page. the fabric is very soft  single layer. the model definitely makes this shirt look slimmer or tighter to the body than the shirt actually is. the slimmer fit was the next thing i was looking forward to  but like other reviews  it is very flowy and the fabric falls away from the bottom below the bust (which i'm not mad about when wearing this in the summer--the occasional breeze will feel nicer with a loose to
-1,These pants were wonderful...for 2 seasons. yes  for almost $200 a pop they don't even last a full year! loved them so much  i bit the bullet & bought 4 pair. all 4 started to rip in the same spot! i tried to contact ag directly & they do not back up their products after 30 days. fortunately  retailer was wonderful (as always!) i will buy pilcro from now on - much better product for the money.
1,"I hate buying dresses because i rarely find one that fits well. i'm very petite on top (xsmall) and small/med on bottom  5'8"". usually dresses are tight on my hips & thighs and loose up top. this fairly lightweight yet warm dress is such a winner! form-fitting yet stretchy and forgiving in all the right places. the x-small and small both fit pretty well but i decided to go with the x-small on this one. i think this will be a staple winter/fall dress. loved the fit so much i bought it in the peac"
0,Pros: pretty  nicely made.    cons: the fabric is stiffer than i was expecting  and the blouse cuts in under the arms. (i don't mean that it is tight or digs in  but it cuts in; you can't tell in the angle of the photo.) the blouse is short as well  and  as i am curvy  it really stuck out all around at the waist. worth trying on if you have a straighter figure.
1,I ordered the xl in the green motif. the shirt is fitted through the body. i'm a pear-shape so it's tight around my hips. it's cut straight down. i'll need to wear this tucked in or belt it/pull it up a bit closer to my waistline so it's more comfortable. the colors & pattern in the green motif are prettier in person. i love orange roses & haven't found any shirt or dress with orange roses before so i kept it. i used my birthday discount to splurge on this. i think it's over-priced for what it i
0,I loved this dress  i usually wear a petite but went with regular based on the reviews. i workout and it was snug on my arms.. fabric felt great  loved the fringe.. just a but snug in the arms for me.
-1,I ordered this vest in xxs  since i am usually an xs and was looking for a bit of a tighter fit on such a loose vest. even then  the vest looked like a large. not only was it incredibly loose - much looser than in looks in the picture - but the arm holes were huge too. it just looked too big  not artfully drapey.
-1,I wish i had read the reviews prior to purchasing. this skirt looks amazing in photos and lace appears black. the lace on mine is actually purple - at first i thought it was just purple due to lighting with red underneath - but nope - pull the netting away and it is purple. lace netting hikes up on the right due to poor craftsmanship. i ordered a medium and felt it was a bit large. will return.
1,I tried the gray pattern on in the store and it is very soft and pretty. the fabric has a nice drape to it. however the length was too long on me  so i came online to find it in petite  but most of the petite sizes are sold out in the gray. i shop at retailer because i like it that so many of their styles are available in petite  however the petite length sizes seem to sell out much faster than the regular sizes. i hope retailer will give us short girls a break and order more petite length sizes so
0,Cute little dress fits tts. it is a little high waisted. good length for my 5'9 height. i like the dress  i'm just not in love with it. i dont think it looks or feels cheap. it appears just as pictured.
1,Great romper i personally would not wear it for ever day - i will be wearing it for a beach cover up while on vacation. for reference i ordered a m and am 130 34b.
0,Pretty color  great details  awesome stitching.. aaaaannnnnnd it actually not only goes out a line but ballooned out above the hem and then came back in - just too much fabric down below. nice at neck  arms and chest but disastrous anywhere below that.
0,I bought this in size xl and the overall fit matched the model's photos. the neckline was a bit higher than pictured. the material was pretty in person. the problem was the material's threads were too scratchy. i was uncomfortable with that scratchiness against my neck so i returned it. i did like the unique leaf pattern of the lace.
1,I'm normally a small in retailer tops  but i could tell that this would run big. i'm glad i sized down to an extra small. this top is flowy and airy without being baggy. the colors are summery and beautiful. my only complaint is that it's a bit sheer  and i can see the outline of my bra in front. i will have to wear a cami underneath.
0,I am on the fence about this one. the length is great. it hits right above my knee at 5'1. overall it was larger than i was hoping. the waist is pretty loose  and i really had to tightly tie the back to get s good shoulder fit. the bottom is very voluminous making me look wide. i wish they had it in a petite size. for this price  i will probably return it. it's not worth the 300 price tag.
0,"I coveted this item since i first saw it on instagram. i finally bought it in coral. it's a beautiful coat  the color is lovely and i like the way the hood makes a cute collar when worn down. the only problem is it looks like a bathrobe on me. i am 5'5"" and wear a size 8. i bought a medium  worried a small would not button. the sleeves are far too long. i do not want to go through the trouble of returning  so gave it to my daughter who is four inches taller. it looks cute in her."

-1,I'm not sure if i only received part of this dress as a mistake  but i received the chiffon shell  but there was no slip as pictured. it makes it kind of difficult to wear when the entire thing is sheer. i had high hopes  but sadly  this is being returned. the xs is out of stock now  so i can't even reorder. bummer.
0,I really lived the detail   fabric  and quality of this tank. however  the sizing seemed disproportionate. it was tight through the bust and loose the waist. i really loved all the colors i purchased online but had to return them because of the sizing.
-1,I wanted to love this dress - and did from the picture online. when it arrived  the black already looked faded and old. also  the embroidery looks like a grandma  but not in a cute vintage way. the fabric is stiff  which causes a boxy  unflattering look. had to return it.
1,Color is beautiful  fits perfectly  lace is lovely and cut is feminine and flattering. hoping to top with a sweater so i can wear it longer in the season.
1,I ordered the medium  my usual size for flowing tops. it fits nicely  looks amazing from the front and looks slimming. then i turned to the side and oh my...my boobs protruded like two big balloons. i looked like wonder woman. there was plenty of fabric and it was billowy so it wasn't the size just the cut. i do have 34 g's but what the heck? the color is glorious but it has to go back.
-1,I gulped when i put this in my bag during retailer days because the price was still too much but thought this has to be wonderful to charge so much  right? boy was i wrong. this is a sweater knit with a very deep v-neck that's incredibly boxy and unattractive. the knit shed all over my pants in the few minutes i had it on. i ordered in xl  having never tried this designer and that was a mistake because i generally wear large or medium. it was swimming on me. the stripes aren't as cute in real life
1,"I absolutely love this cardigan! it is so soft and goes with anything. it can be dressed up or down. it is definitely my new ""go to"" for airplane travels. highly recommend!!"
-1,I purchased the dress with the bow-back shift in peach because i loved it's nautical theme pattern.  when i recurve do the dress  i found it to be stiff and boxy.  being a petite  short-waisted person  the top portion of the stress hung on my body awkwardly.  my bra strap was showing in the back  and the dress needed to be pulled up about 2 inches to properly sit on my frame.    i returned the dress
1,I think this is the first peasant top i've found that doesn't fit like a tent! i did size down to a small  although i'm normally between small and medium. i even found that the shape of this top is quite flattering. maybe the darker embroidery helps. i'm very happy with this purchase.
1,This cover up has great potential. i love the embroidery. the colors and design are great. however  it has a number of loose strings. it makes me wonder what might happen when i wash it. the fabric is on the thinner side  but it is not see through. the fabric would be nice for a hot day by the pool. i caught it on sale  so i am keeping it.
0,This top may be right for some  but it did not work for me. i've been looking for a nice black top and loved the flutter sleeves on this one. however  it didn't do much to flatter my body. i ordered the xl  but it was huge. i'm not sure a l would have solved my problems if it had been available. i found it looked boxy and and agree that the arm holes are too big.     the quality is great and style so pretty  though. i wish it had worked for me!
-1,Beautiful jacket and i got lots of compliments. true to size. it's not thick but it's very warm.
1,This dress is extremely body conscious. so if you want to make an impression  wear this dress. the fabric is thick and best worn on a cooler night. the pattern is gorgeously done  pieced together like a garment three times the cost. the cut of the armholes might not be flattering on those with broad shoulders or chubby upper arms (like myself). for me this dress is tts but way too long  so i will have to hem.
0,Wish i'd noticed that the sleeve cuff and hem were 'cut' to look hippie-casual. i'm taking this back with great regret. it's soft and the prettiest pale lime-sherbet color; made for a cool summer look. i don't like 'tattered ' though - so back it goes. sigh. it's soft  true fit  and beautiful. i'd buy it in many colors and in the lovely lavender print if it wasn't for the 'cuts.'
0,"I likded this but tried it in two sizes and it was still too big in the armpit. my bra showed. i am about a d cup  smallish in other proportions (125  5'6"") and no bra worked with this so that i wouldn't have to worry about my bra showing. nice fabric and drape. maybe good for someone who doesn't need a bra?"
0,Well made. made my hips looks giant. just not my style unfortunately. i'd have to work at preschool or on a ship to pull this off. i'm 5'3 120-123lbssize 6-8. i got the size 6 (not petite cuz they were sold out).
0,"I love the color and style of this sweater and was very eager to wear it  which i've now done on two occasions. but now i'm concerned about the quality and also wondering if there is a long version of this sweater and a shorter version i am 5'6"" and thin  but the sweater doesn't hit me mid thigh - only goes to upper thigh and i measured 25"" in length on my sweater rather than 30"" which seems to indicate a shorter length than on the model i wish it were longer. more a problem is that the fuzzy pa"
0,"This top is cut too short & wide with too much light material in between. to be truly slimming & flattering  it needs to have more of the rayon/spandex blend  to make it heavier & bouncier. then it would ""hang"" appropriately and ""swing"" and (hopefully) not add pounds to the wearer. unfortunately this top is too lightweight & has too much material. pass."
-1,Super cute dress online on the model. what you can't tell from the picture is the slip underneath is not true to size of the dress and the outside layer of the dress is more sheer than the picture shows so you can tell the slip underneath is very tight. it might be my body type. otherwise  it's super cute in person and i wish it would've fit better!
0,I adore a good vest  so when i saw this one at my retailer i had to try it on immediately. i don't wear cream often  but the design and weight of this vest is dreamy. i tried it on at the store and i was on the fence. so i bought it  took it home and tried it on with everything. i am a curvy girl  and i wasn't thrilled with how this fit. now its part of the retailer athleisure line  and i could definitely see this being worn post workout with cute workout gear. girls who are tall and thin  or even w
0,I ordered this top because 1. the online product page states the fabric is cotton. 2. i liked the style with the scarf insets. 3. the colorful embroiderey would be a welcome companion for my many pairs of pilcro chinos.    when i opened the package several tiny round beads rolled out. after examining the detailing  i found where the beads were missing.    size: i normally wear a small for most retailer brands  but i know nothing about slone rouge. i went with a small since it appears oversized on
1,"These jeans not only fit well  i love the way the fabric feels. for denim the fabric feels soft on the skin. i am 5'8 and the inseam of 30 inches was perfect. they call them ""hi-rise""  but them seem more like a ""mid-rise"" to me which i prefer. i am going to buy another pair in a different wash."
0,It's okay for a coverup or beach dress and lounging around the house. it's comfy and i like the detail of the back. the front is very plain but okay. it's not too baggy and it's a straight cut. the detail in the back makes it a keeper for me but only as a casual dress too chill at home or quick errands to grocery store.
1,This is a really great top. it is really soft and made very well. it could be a casual top with jeans  or  dress up with some chunky jewelry and cute heels. i wasn't sure which size to get because i mostly get mediums amd i sometimes get a large. i ended up going with a large and it seemed to be just a little too big  but it doesn't have that look at all. it looks so much better in person than on the computer. overall a very cute top!
-1,A truly unwearable slip: scratchy fabric  bunchy skirt  teeny bodice. it feels like you are wearing wrapping paper--the foil kind.
-1,Received this in the mail today and was disappointed. i typically wear a 6/8 but bought this in the 8 as i had purchased another similar top from the same company in an 8. this does not fit the same at all. the top pulled in my shoulder and chest area while had ample room in the body. needless to say i will be returning this item
0,Had to send back for exchange. way too big. i'm very excited to get a smaller size because they are really beautifully made.
1,"I loved this dress as soon as i tried it on  but... it bunched up weird in the front around my hips. i ordered a second size 4  hoping that it would fit better. but same thing. if i tried to go to a size 6 it would be too big every where else. fyi - i'm 5'8"" 129lbs and i'm a runner. it's not like i have a huge backside or anything. my guess is sizing is off. i've tried another of his dresses and it fit perfectly."
-1,"I was really hoping to like this  but it did not look the way it does on the model  at least not on me. the sharkbite hem is much more pronounced and looser. the one in the photo looks like it was pinned back. i am 5'8"" and usually wear a medium or large. i got a medium and there was a lot more material on the bottom half than the photo shows. it made me look bigger and was not flattering. material has a nice weave but it's thin and delicate. i bought the (holly) deep olive and the blue. colors"
-1,The front cream panel is completely transparent.i didn't purchase because my bra showed and it would ruin the look with a cami underneath.  i wish the fabric were translucent - not so see through.
1,"I had a hunch that this would run big based on the style and brand  so ordered an xs instead of my normal s and it was perfect! the fit on me is exactly like the model shot - swingy but still cute and falls nicely. i am 5'7""  128#  34a for reference. i got the orange color and would say it is a little more on the reddish/burnt orange side than what is pictured. it's very cute - i'm happy to keep it at the promo price."
0,First off: kudos to the other reviewers for setting the expectation re: the color on these! they are not a dark rinse at all - not even close. they're a light-to-medium hue with fading down the front of the thighs. with that in mind  i do like the color - especially for spring - but would have been very miffed had i ordered these and they arrived so starkly different from the online photo.  ----------  i typically wear a 27-29  depending on the brand and waist rise. these were an online return t
0,"This dress was so lovely in person  but when i put it on...ooh la la! it is short! i am 5' 3"" and i would not walk outside in this dress without something underneath. it just needed one more tier and i would have kept it for sure. too bad!"
-1,I ordered this dress online. the previous reviews were accurate that it runs small  particularly in the waist. i normally wear a 0 or 2  but i ordered the 4. it fit my waist and hips but was slightly loose at the top even though i am a 34c. i liked the look  but it had a hole where the seams had come apart between the black stripe across the chest and the main fabric. additionally  the black squares were pulled in several places with threads sticking out. i returned it immediately.
0,This dress has a beautiful purple paisley print and reminds me of classic retailer from years ago. i wanted to love the dress but it runs extremely large. i usually wear a 00p or xxsp and got this in an xxsp but was still way too big. while the intent is to be flowy  i was overwhelmed by the bagginess and it changes the style from flowy to bag-like. while the belt helps cinch the waist  i had too much bunching in the waist area making it unattractive. very disappointed as its such a pretty
-1,I wore this for a few hours  and while it i got compliments i ended up needing to return it after the seams opened up over the shoulder blades. the fabric is so fine that during the normal goings-about of my day it gave way. and no  i didn't buy too small  and the fabric didn't pull while i was driving or reaching for anything.
1,This is a great looking sweater. very nice quality and is a great design. can wear with many colors. love the look of this sweater and how it lays with the extra attachment on the bottom of it to make it kinda have a floating and airy look. nice!!!!.
-1,The design and style of shirt is quite cute -- but the mountain pictures is not mont blanc  nor does the mountain find itself near chamomix. it is an unmistakable image of the matterhorn and the small town of zermatt is at its base.
0,I had this shirt in mauve and loved it so i ordered it in navy. i love the lightweight material. i love the way it fits. however - all the seams are sewn  quite obviously  inside out. only after i received the navy shirt  where it is extremely obvious  did i check the mauve one. those seams are also inside out but done in a much tidier fashion so that it wasn't really noticable. i was unhappy with the sloppiness of the seams on the navy shirt but  because i love the style and the fit  i kept it.
-1,I am a curvy girl and bought these jeans in a size 31. i don't have stick legs  and the jeans have worn right through were my thighs rub together. with the old pilcro material  this did not happen! this is a super soft jean  and although the fit was good  they just didn't last.
-1,"I was so excited to get this top... and while it is soooo amazingly soft  i still could not keep it. i must admit that i am only 5'2""  so i do think this had quite a bit to do with my dislike of this... but i felt like a matador  which is definitely not what i was going for... maybe if your tall and lean  this would work.  but for me  no way."
0,Beautiful dress  but it just didn't look that flattering on me. the quality was nice and it looked just like the picture. unfortunately it just looked shapeless on me so i had to return it. the dress is probably more flattering if you have long legs to show off  i definitely don't!
-1,I was so excited to order this dress  had the perfect red shoes to go with it. unfortunately i could have been nine months pregnant and still wear the small. i am 5'4/118lb and it was like a maternity dress. sad to send it back.
0,"This dress is adorable and well made. this brand runs on the large side. i ordered an xs and the tag says 'p"" on it. it's not petite. it ran large through the hips and will need alteration. i'm keeping it because it is really cute and is well made. the material is knit and soft - very comfortable. i'm surprised nobody has reviewed this item. i probably will not buy this brand again only because it runs large."
-1,Oh such a classic retailer look for summer! a vintage pattern on a crisp cotton fabric. i was immediately drawn to it. but wait- there is a sort of wrap around tie at the waist  creating the look of an apron. yes. it looks like one is wearing a full apron. or scrub dress.   why?? this would have been sooo much better as a simple shift or a skirt/blouse combo.
1,Love this shirt  very flattering fit on my pear shape. also accommodates my larger 32dd bust without straining on the buttons. ever so slightly sheer fabric  but no cami needed if wearing a nude bra.
-1,Good reason to read reviews. i concur with others in that it fins large and looks boxy. heavy fabric makes matters worse.
0,I am tall and typically wear a size 10/12  so i thought i could pull this off even if it was large as the other review noted. but the thing about this piece is that it is more of a cover-up than a tunic. it fits like a poncho. with my arms at my sides  it fit me similar to the model picture. but if i lift my arms (to use them)  then it looks like i am wearing a dress that is designed for someone twice as large as me. the reason for that is that it doesn't really have sleeves - it's more like hol
-1,This sweater/jacket looks just like the photo in real life  but the inside is so scratchy. i physically recoiled when trying it on as the interior of the sleeves feels like sandpaper. unlined and uncomfortable. no thank you!  should you choose to proceed  i found the fit tts. i'm 5'8  wear an 8/10 and the medium worked for me.
1,I tried this in the black and white in the store. the material is very thin. you cannot wear the white without a cami which defeats the purpose of wearing this tank in the summery. the arm holes are cut very inconsistently. some are very big which creates a very unflattering gap under the armpit. others are cut fine. i tried on 3 different smalls in the black and found one that was cut just right. this does fit snuggly  but is more flattering that way.
0,I ordered this skirt and i was so excited when i first saw it. the photo doesn't really do the colors justice. the contrast of the bright colors makes this skirt one of a kind. i returned this item however because when i tried it on  the pattern was just at the wrong place and emphasized the thighs for any of us pear-shaped ladies. the side profile of my thighs in this skirt was just horrible.
-1,Looked really cute on the hanger  so i took it with me into the dressing room. the fabric is super soft  and the top is very flattering however the bottom is way too short! you can't tell from the picture but the sides are rounded and go up higher on your leg. the model has the waist band pulled lower than i think you'd most likely be wearing it making the outfit appear longer. i wish i could pull this off...maybe i'm just too old for it.
-1,I was so excited to get this dress. i need it for a wedding  and i thought i had hit the jackpot. the dress arrived with a small tear. the seams are puckered and badly seen.  for an almost $300.00 dress  the quality is terrible. i expect better from retailer. i'm so disappointed.
0,Although the blouse is pretty it did not fit me well. i downsized two sizes and it still didn't hang well on my body. i think it looks great on the model and would probably look better on a thinner person. i am disappointed it did not work out and i will be returning it.
1,Due to the prior review  this top came without any surprises.  i had read about the open sleeves and actually have a dress with a similar design.  this top can be dressed up or down and is perfect with skinny pants.
0,"I'm a size 28 jeans 5'9 with a bubble bottom. these were falling off of me around the hips. these are warm. i was expecting them to not be sheer since they are fleece lined but when i sat down i was shocked to notice it. it doesn't matter functionality wise because i never felt a ""draft."" they look good and are well made but i will be returning due to the lack of fit."
-1,I just returned this top. i agree with the previous reviewer. the neckline is way too deep  i ordered small and i looked ridiculous in it. also the ruffles didn't look so great on me either.
1,When i first put this dress on  i immediately thought...oh no  i can't pull this off. at least  not without a cow to milk. but this dress is so comfortable. the material feels divine and the quality really is excellent for the price. the pattern of the panel on the bodice creates a slimming effect so it is also very flattering if you can get the waist to hit right. (i had to try on a few different bras to make this happen.) fits true to size. i got a size 2 - my usual size and i have gained a fe
0,This dress had a nice silhouette  but the armholes were cut a bit wide and made it look sloppy- too bad - it would've made a nice casual dress!
1,I ordered this in black and in the print and i am super happy with both. the fabric is very soft. i've worn it with denim and khaki shorts as well as with a cute skirt for work. very versatile.
1,"Recently bought these on sale  though they were still a bit in the expensive side. i'm 5'2"" and typically a size 4  the xs fits perfectly. the pants fall to my ankle and are not cropped as they are on the model  but i'm fine with that. the piping on the seams helps them not seem too much like pajamas  and i was particularly pleased that the crotch was not too baggy  as sometimes happens with this style."
1,"The romper is well made and just plain cute. i bought it the second i saw it and don't regret my impulse buy one bit. 135 5'5"" and the small fit perfectly."
1,"I'm currently on the prowl for the other colors of this fantastic sweater dress/tunic. i own the lavender in size m and it fits perfectly on me (5'3"" 36dd) without enhancing what i want to hide. great for winter"
-1,My v-shape figure (broad shoulder  narrow hips  waist not well defined) looked completely square in this. not flattering at all. perhaps better for other figures.
-1,I ordered the top from a store to have it shipped.   it is very pretty but once on  it fit the wrong way. i got a small because i know that this designer tends to run tight across the bust.   the shoulder was too rounded for this neck line. sleeves should have been either longer or sleeveless. the empire waist even on a smaller busted woman like myself was cut too high.
0,I loved the dog on this sweater  and i rushed into the store to buy it. once i tried it on  like others  i did find it to be itchy  but that i could deal with using a tank or something. what bothered me the most was the way the arms were cut. my arms looked much bigger than they are  so sadly i left it at the store. it really is a cute sweater though...
1,"I bought this top in lavender. this top is light and smooth on your body and true to size. i'm 5'4""  34dd  150 lbs- m fits well. it hides the imperfections in the tummy area and i find myself going for this top a lot. it's a very easy to put on and take to it off."
1,This dress is very versatile and i plan to use in all year round with some tights and boots in the fall/winter and strappy sandals in spring/summer. i originally purchased this dress in a m but had to size down for a more snug and flattering fit. the navy is much darker than the picture.
1,Loved this dress but ran much larger than other maeve dresses i have ordered in the past!
1,A perfect go-to top. looks great with jeans - dark   faded or bright white. top it with a cardigan or wear it bare - it offers a flattering fit with its high-quality  textured fabric. i normally wear a small or medium top. an extra-small fits me perfectly.

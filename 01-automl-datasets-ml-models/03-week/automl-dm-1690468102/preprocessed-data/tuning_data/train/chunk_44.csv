1,This sweater is so unique. not for the faint of heart but it's beautiful. hubby thought pattern looked southeast asian inspired. the colors are saturated  vibrant. love the raglan sleeves and the tweed on the sleeves and in the back. the front material is slightly stiffer. i feel like i have a little bit more bulk in the stomach area than i want but i'm willing to overlook it. will be a great sweater for the holiday season. wear it with a skirt  jeans  skinny cargos. endless possibilities.
0,Love the color  cut  and weight (its like a fleece-weight coat  but longer and more appropriate for an office.)  within two wears one of the buttons popped off.  within three wears  one of the back shoulder seams had split.  this coat is lovely but shoddily made. worth it with a discount and if you know how to hand-sew  because minor repairs will be in your future. it is so beautiful but not worth full price at this build quality.
0,"I love the details and design of this top- my only issue is the top is a bit too ""flowy""."
0,I am usually a size 2 in tops. i am very  very rarely a size 0  so upon reading other reviews of this top i decided to order the 2 and assumed it would fit the way a 2 usually does. obviously this is designed to be a loose  flowing top. that's why i wanted to order it. however  the 2 is simply too loose in every direction. my primary gripe is that the arm holes are gaping and falling at the side in a way i don't think it intended.    i do really like the styling and quality  so i am planning on
-1,The tops looks fitted on the model because she pressed her arms against the clothes. to my surprise   the tops actually is very very very r o o m y below the chest area.  the appliques/laces on the front are made of low quality materials.
-1,I had high hopes for this top but once again it is just a big boxy too much material top. i get the style but if it adds 10lbs to your middle area its not for me. it is a thin material so it does hang nice.
1,Gorgeous detail on the sleeve. adorable pattern. unfortunately  it is a little too cropped & it's not actually sleeves. it's a cape style. wasn't expecting  but still really cute.
0,I don't have a lot of pink or lavender in my wardrobe  but any time i do try a shade like this on i always think it compliments my skin tone and hair color. i generally wear a mauve-ish or coppery eye shadow and the color of this shirt looks beautiful against that makeup too. unfortunately  i just don't find the shape of the top to be flattering. it's really long  so the way the model has it partially tucked looks best but i'm not really thin like her and i have a larger chest... it just doesn't
0,Usually can just buy tiny shirts knowing that they will fit me!  and this one is beautiful but if you have any type of chest it will not work.  i'm a 34d and it  was way too small in the chest area.  it is a beautiful shirt though and i'm very sad that i have to return it.  it will work better on someone else for sure.  so i recommend this beautiful shirt for someone with a different body type from mine!
-1,Bummer  i loved the lacy bell arms and everything about the look of this sweater but it is huge in the abdomen. seriously looks maternity to me. the neck is also too wide. the quality of the material is very nice and the weight is nice and heavy but the cut just didn't work on me. i returned this one.
1,This shirt is amazing! the soft fabric  detailed embroidery  and gorgeous little beads/sequins..all fabulous quality and make this piece worth the price. i love the length and cut of this too - not boxy  yet not too tight or fitted; just covers my bum. can be dressed up or down.
-1,I fell in love with this cute top  however after reading reviews  i am going to return it. seems there is a problem with it shrinking after following washing instructions. who wants to dry clean a tank top? not me  sadly. too bad. style was cute and color was awesome.
0,This top is adorable in style and fit. which is why it breaks my heart that i can't recommend it. the embroidery snags so easily  when i wore it  i ended up with several tears in the threads  leaving the pattern a bit of a mess. it snagged on my rings  my watch and my purse. i returned it because of this. it's really too bad  and i wish the design were printed on instead of sewn  simply because it would last a lot longer.
-1,I saw the photo of the young woman wearing this dress in the reviews and she looked beautiful  i on the other hand looked awful. the fabric of the entire dress is quite stiff  so the dress didn't move with me; it sort of felt as if i was wearing a paper cut out. then to contribute to the volume  the sleeve is not set in  it is a raglan style  that on me looked more like a bat suit  than what i was hoping for  a beautiful distinctive dress for an important affair. also the belt didn't enhance the
0,I agree with those who thought this material looked a little cheap. i ordered the white knowing about the sleeves and thought i'd like the slits  but the material + sleeves definitely gave an undesired pirate vibe.    true to size.
0,I didn't plan to wear this off shoulder. sadly the neck is too loose and big if worn on shoulder. the fabric is nice. i liked the vintage looking design that's black with purple flowers. the body has a lot of fabric and although i ordered size large  i would size down to a medium if i were to reorder. don't think i will  though.
-1,Normally  hd in paris brand is spot on for their dresses. this dress is a big thumbs down. as most of these reviewer's and myself point out  the large arm holes do not allow you to wear a regular bra because you don't just get a peak of your bra  you get to see the whole side of it. secondly  the bust of the dress would work only for an a-cup bra  too small for the average woman. the only bright spot with this dress is the brilliant colors available and the quality of the fabric itself - excelle
1,This dress will take you through fall  winter and spring. i love all the stitching and design detail. it has a nice swingy skirt that is quite a bit longer in the back.
-1,As another reviewer noted  the upper portion (back  chest  shoulders  etc.) fit nicely. however  the body of the dress was enormous and did  indeed  make me look much heavier throughout the middle. back to the store it goes.
1,I wasn't overly impressed or drawn to this dress at first  even after i bought it  but after wearing it  i am sold! i paired the orange version with caramel colored sandals and gold jewelry. i thought it was necessary to wear a long necklace to bring some interest to the otherwise plain top. the dress is super comfortable - fabric  fit and length. it billows in such a pretty way when you walk! the color also made my skin look extra tan  which i loved! the waist is short and rides up now and then
1,I sized down from my typical size small. beautiful detail on the back. slightly sheer in front but dark bra or cami fixes that. shorter in front than back but not too short. goes with jeans and pants plus a shorter cardigan or denim jacket would look great.
0,This is one of those dresses that might be better for those under 40. on me  the fullness of the pleats and the bell sleeve made me feel like i was wearing one of those dresses for a much older lady. i miss not having to consider those things. the red color is lovely and the dress is modest. i just think it will read a lot better on a younger chiquita.
0,As much as i loved the fabric and lace on this top  the cut of this blouse was not flattering for my body shape. also i thought it was shorter than it looked online. i had to return this piece.
-1,As another reviewer pointed out  although the tag inside the dress says that you can machine wash in cold water  the color around the popsicles will bleed! this is extremely disappointing. i'm hoping it can either be fixed with dye remover  or that retailer will take this item back. would only dry clean this item.
1,This top/jacket is less red than it appears in the pictures - more of a wine color (as it is labeled) but it is pretty and the gold details are nice.
0,Looks better online than in person. material makes it look a little puffy
0,This shirt is cute  nice cut  but i don't love it. best as a sleeping tank.
-1,I wanted to like this top  as the fabric was nice and thick  but found that it dipped too low beneath the armpits  which would be ok if your lats are in perfect shape  but i've always found that cut made mine look a bit saggy (and i'm not heavy). not great enough to keep in my opinion.
0,"It made me look extra thick in the middle--could pass for maternity wear. pretty colors. fabric is fine. it's just too shapeless and not flattering on me. i'm 5'11"" and it was also on the short side for me. even if it fit better  probably too short for my age (40s)."
1,I ordered the mustard shade in size xl. it is so well-made & comfortable. the patterned lining makes it extra cute and extra soft to wear. it's washed well too. i like the shorter length. it it fun to play with proportions when using it. i ordered the navy in xl since i've gotten such great use out of the yellow one. it hasn't shed/pilled either. well-made  quirky and useful for layering!
-1,I wanted to love this. however  the fit was funky and the colors were muted. this is definitely something you must try on in the store. too risky to buy online due to weird fit.
0,Not sure why it has gotten good ratings and or why sold out online periodically. awkward fit and flares quit a bit at waist. also has extra material at waist line so does not look flattering.
1,I tried this on at the suggestion of one of the sales girls. i was skeptical of the simple shape  but when i put on the green one  i didn't want to take it off-ever. i am 6' and thin- the small fits me perfectly. i loved it so much  i purchased the blue as well. love  love  love!
1,I'm small (4'11  98 pounds and 34a) so the regular xs looks like a baby doll dress on me.  i just wear the tunic with a tank top underneath (or i can wear the tunic by itself) and leggings plus a pair of boots.  the top part is slightly baggy so if you want tight fitting  is size down to xxs.  i got the yellow flower and white + grey one and plan to get the navy one soon.  the quality is good and you can machine wash it with cold water.  i plan to use a tide sweater garment bag to wash it (i put
1,The shirt was better than it actually looked online. the only downfall was that there was a pulled thread on the shirt when i received it. it's something i can probably fix  just a little disappointed receiving in that shape.  i would recommend this top. very flattering and dressy if you want it to be.
1,Love this tunic. very comfortable and a perfect length to the knee. i wore it to a birthday party with brown booties. the green moss color is perfect for the fall in new england. can't wait to wear it again.
-1,I purchased this jacket in my local store. size 10 and runs really small . i love the color combination and design but the fabric in my opinion is poor quality. i have seen a lot of retailer use this poly spun knit in so much of their items and the jacket after bringing it home and looking in the light was already showing pilling. looks like it is worn in an bad way. returned the next day. this was a big disappointment and every time i see this fabric being used in retailer clothes it makes me mad.
-1,I saw this top online and ordered immediately!  i loved the color  lace  and unique details.  sadly it just arrived and it is a disaster!  the lace is stiff and doesn't lay softly  and is very rough against your skin.  the style ( and i like shorter style tops) is extremely boxy and the sleeves protrude outwards in a funny way. .....  that although i am so in love with this color  i would be embarrassed to wear this top in public.  it could have been fantastic  if the lace was softer  and some a
1,"I read the previous reviews and had hoped that the exclamations about the color being inaccurate were exaggerated- however they are sadly very true. let me be clear that this is a beautiful  comfortable piece of clothing- when you put it on it feels thick and of very good quality. and while the pattern is interesting and pretty  the ""dark orange"" color i was expecting is actually a mud brown. i think it's unfortunate that retailer misrepresented such a key element of the jacket  but i digress. the"
1,When i tried them on  i didn't want to take them off! they are so soft  so stylish  they drape your body just the right way  they are stretchy  so even though i am wearing 30 in jeans  i took s regular! run hone and tried it on with moss cowled side-zip tunic  2 different booties and aquaflora reversible vest  all variations and combos looked really cool and great! i even tried with high heeled booties and dressier sweater top (warm-up pullover in charcoal)  looked like high couture! the color i
1,Great shirt  more of a stretch to it than i thought it would. very flowy  looks great with jeans & leggings.
-1,#childsize. not sure where this went wrong but it's going back immediately. always wear a 0-2 in retailerpologist skirts  this size 0 runs at least two sizes too small. the material is beautiful  but if i got the size i needed i would be entirely swallowed by fabric. so disappointing.
0,This is a beautiful dress. all that's missing is a bonnet!
1,These leggings were everything i expected them to be. they are well made  and the material is thick enough that i can wear them outside in the colder months of the year. the pattern on the website is accurate  and the waistband is comfortable and flattering. would definitely buy again!
0,I wanted to love this shirt. it's got a thicker material  a flattering shape and the uniqueness for a basic top. however when i put this on  it just looked like it was ill-fitting over the chest. i think if the pull was below the chest  it would be much better.
-1,This dress is gorgeous as displayed at store. color is vibrant  but the one i ordered looked dull and wrinkles very easily. i wore it to a ceremony and the seatbelt left me wrinkled before i arrived. the top is very wide and best to wear strapless.
-1,This is quite an odd dress. it does wrap and is beautiful material. however  the dress does not close at all in the chest area. i thought perhaps it was meant to be a kimono. it will go back for sure.
0,"This swimsuit is very well made and even prettier in person. i'm 5'8"" and about 145 pounds. i usually wear a size 6. i wear a 34d bra. i found the suit to run a bit small. i returned it because  despite how much i liked the style  it just wasn't flattering on my body type."
-1,I tried this blouse on and loved the style  comfort and color of the peach so much that i was preparing to buy it. when i pulled the sleeve the fabric came away from the cuff. i tested another spot pulling only gently and the same thing happened. too bad since the color would have been a great addition for me.     but--i also tried the blue and it gets 4 stars  as the fabric is much better. it too is adorable  soft and did not tear on gentle testing. the two blouse colors are made from different
1,"This is just a fantastic dress! i bought it in my usual m in the blue and it fits like a glove. i love the varying lengths and the adorable sleeves and the substantial knit which feels amazing on the body without revealing any bumps and lumps :) i took the regular length and found it perfect. the front hits about two inches above my knee and the rest hits a bit lower. i'm only 5""1  but i prefer dresses that hit closer to my knee than mini so the regular was perfect for me  definitely a keeper!"
0,I am a petite size 10 and 5&#39;1&quot;     i love the fabric and style of the dress  but found it to be too much dress for me.  the skirt is very full and with the top i feel it would look better on a thin  taller person.
-1,I was really disappointed with these pants. they were a thinner fabric than expected with little to no stretch. they were very tight around my legs and huge at the waist. sadly  they will be going back.
0,I really wanted to love this top. love the mix of fabrics and patterns. but it is too short for a tunic length. i should have paid attention to other reviews. i'm about 5'8'' and was not too tight in the bust and shoulders.i have to return because the length isn't right.
0,I wanted to love this top. i wanted to love it so badly i bought it twice. the design and beading are beautiful  but the sizing is off. as another person mentioned it does run short  but that was not the issue for me. i ordered my usual size in this brand and the arm holes were too tight. because i really love it  i decided to exchange it for a larger size. i did not try it on in the store because i never wear that size  and just assumed the arm holes would be larger. sadly they were not. still
1,Best part: covers my bum. perfect for teaching  casual girls' night or casual date night.  my only complaint is there aren't other colors. awful decision. i would have purchased at least 5 of these at the right price.
-1,I really fell in love with this shirt. i am about 5 4 and 110 pounds. i ordered xxs which that was a good size from the chest but this shirt is literally so wide  i was ready to fly. although the model wears this shirt really nicely  i think this shirt is made for a certain type of body. not quite sure what that is.... also this shirt is shorter than what i expected. it looks a lot longer on the model. i had to return this shirt.
1,After seeing how this looked on model in the picture i had a feeling it might be not only a bit short but also high waisted. so i took a chance and ordered a regular size 2. i am 5'1 115lbs  so i typically order a petite 2. received this today and am very happy i made that choice. the waistline hits where it should and the skirt hit right at my knees. the fabric is perfect for winter. i was actually surprised at the weight of the dress when i pulled it from the box - it was very heavy. the lace
-1,I so wanted to like this dress i ordered it for summer graduation and weddings. i usually wear a 4/s and even the xs is was too pig. it drapes like a smock. the material is heavy. the only thing pretty about this dress is the pattern and color.    still looking for the perfect dress...
-1,Fits very strange. odd cut. does not look well on.
1,This is an absolutely fabulous skirt. i cant wait to wear it. the biggest challenge is finding the best way to accessorize it. i am an artist and have lots of clothing  but haven't created that ab fab combo yet. i will!!!!
1,In the quest to find comfy  cute  casual tops i took a change on this one. it's cute but quite oversized. it just overwhelmed me. i ordered the large and generally wear medium or large so you can safely size down at least a size or two and still get the fit shown on the model. the style and color just didn't suit my coloring or body type   but i still recommend because it's comfortable and different enough to be a nice addition to someone else's closet.
0,Material is a little think and they run a bit long like many other retailer pants. otherwise  a great deal if you get them on sale.
-1,"This shirt is adorable.  but...it didn't work for me!  i'm a smaller gal with a large chest (5'4""  34g). i tried on the small  since it seemed so flowy and large. the sleeves were tight  yet the back of the shirt flowed way too much  making the shirt look huge on me. perhaps a more fitted back  and i would have been in love.  love the blue color!"
1,As all the reviews say it is completely sheer. it's a very cute top other than that.
1,"So this dress is absolutely gorgeous! my problem is i am 5'10"" and it is very short wasted. between the shoulders and waist and even the arm holes it just plain doesn't work. i think if you are taller this dress just won't work. i have purchased other items from this name brand and have had the same problem."
-1,This top was much more fitted than expected and was not flattering. i would not recommend.
0,I tried on this shirt in the small and the xxs - both were ridiculously wide. they were also both cut really short - the peplum basically started right below my boobs  though the small was maybe a little bit longer than the eex. the stripes are really cute  the cut is just very strange.     for reference  the black and white is the small  the taupe is the xxs.
-1,One can't tell from the picture but the top shoulder part is sheet and transparent. it also is very long almost dress length.  feels less quality than what retailer usually carries.
1,I love the dress!  i purchased this dress to wear on my honeymoon to paris.  it made me feel like a princess walking around the gardens of versalles while wearing it!
0,I purchased this shirt with the purple colored flowers. while the cut is fine  the quality of the fabric is not great so the shirt is very see-through. will be returning it.
0,This tunic is way over priced for the style and quality. it fit comfortably (runs a size larger) but it's not really flattering  it jut kind of hangs there looking ok. it is a little too deep of a v cut for a work top as well. this top does not support the price at all. it felt like something i could find at department store for way less. i will be returning it.
-1,This skirt is definitely not what i was expecting. the material is stiff and rough. the skirt is also loud. you can hear it swishing when you move  and not in a classy way. it feels like you're wearing a very long tutu. also  the pattern isn't quite as pretty in person. they must have used magic in order to make this skirt look flowy in the photos - it does not flow.

0,This is a super cute tunic - it is simply way too big.
1,I ordered this dress online and didn't really know what to expect. but to my surprise  it's exactly what i had hoped it would be. the dress is a fantastic fit and has a modern  interesting print. the fabric does seem thin for the price. but i am not returning it. it's a casual summer dress that kicks up my look a notch on weekends. i wear it with beige sandals  and the gray and beige look good together too.
-1,I thought this would be a cute business attire skirt. i hate to say it  but i felt like it flared out as if i were amelia bedelia or some whacky children's book character and not retailer. the fabric made it look bulky. i sadly had to return it.
0,First off  this shirt is a hd in paris brand  not floreat. i love floreat clothing so that is why i initially bought this blouse. i like the idea and the coloring of the shirt. the biggest drawback for me was that it is completely see through. i just bring myself to get a strapless cami just to wear this one top. please change brand name.
0,Dang  i got a small and was still swimming in it. it's made of the fabric that increasingly seems to be the fabric of choice for all things t-shirty- soft and thin-ish  a bit translucent. i'd rather wait for something more formfitting and flattering- back it went.
-1,Really loved this dress online and was excited to try it out. when it arrived it was heavy & bulky in the package which didn't bode well. taking it out of the bag  i was surprised at how heavy & thick it was. the picture really looks like it would be a flowy  grecian dress to throw on during a hot summer day ? but in the reality you might drown in sweat. the interior linings promised absolutely no breathing fabric.    wanted to love this as the style is very cute but was disappointed by the mate
-1,I tried on and bought this shirt in my usual size and it fit long and loose but still had great shape. after hand washing in cold water and air drying  as per instructions on the tag  the shirt shrunk significantly. so much so that my stomach shows if i raise my arms at all. it also lost its shape  and now looks very boxy and is very unflattering. i won't be wearing it and am disappointed i didn't even get to wear it once!
0,"Uncertain about sizing i got both the 4 & the 6...both made me look like a no-asser :( neither fit quite right in the leg. both hit at a weird point in my calf  not cute-short  just off. (i'm 5'8"" and 125#) to quote my husband  ""nope. not feeling these."" that said  they feel great on  seem to be made well  but are heading back to an retailer near you :( sigh. the quest continues :)"
1,"The print  layers and fit of this dress remind me of the 1990's but in a good way! the outer dress is voluminous and flowy  so i understand why some reviewers feel the dress runs large. the embroidered slip is tts and quite the cherry on top. i really appreciate that styling detail. 140# 36dd 5'3"" and i chose medium regular length  not petite since i'm older and wanted the length."
-1,I purchased these pants while on vacation because i thought they'd be the perfect addition to my comfy travel wardrobe. on my second wear  i happened to be on a long-haul flight when the entire side seam split about a food long on my upper  outer thigh. luckily i'd packed a back-up dress. the pants weren't tight at all  but the seams wren't strong enough to handle a little pressure from sitting i guess. poor construction. i would not recommend these.
0,I wanted to love the stress so much i mean who doesn't love polkadots and a good maxi! unfortunately the fit was too awkward. the bust is saggy and the waist seems to poof out
0,I like the fabric - very smooth and feels nice on the skin. i like the handkerchief hemline too.i didn't realize how much i would not like the neckline. it feels too tight and too high to me and i'm not sure i could wear this for long without pulling at the neck. also  the fit is loose  maybe a bit too loose for my taste. but it's the neck fit that makes me have to return this dress.
0,I love the look of this dress and i love the way it is cut. the one thing i do not love is the thickness of the material. it is just too much for a summer dress. it just felt heavy and hot. i still love this brand so i am hopeful for a few more great options to come out before summer is over.
1,"I think the fabric is very nice and soft. i find this top runs very large. i am 5'2"" 130l. normally wear a small in a shirt. i should have ordered xs it is very large. i actually looked to see if they sent me the wrong size. the shoulder area fits fine. i may try tucking it in. other than size a nice top."
-1,I wish i had read the other review about the color of the pink version of this sweater before i ordered it. she was absolutely right - the color is completely different in person. it is this garish pink and brown that looks like it was knit together with remaindered yarn. it's too bad  because the cut of the sweater is cute and the zipper adds a funky touch. maybe the blue is better in person...
1,This cream sweater is a great addition to your wardrobe. the length hits below the waist and the zipper adds an updated touch to the look. is a bit itchy but there's room for a light layer underneath.
1,Just tried this on in store. the color in the photo is wayyyyy off. it's a hunter green and dark navy zigzag. for maeve it runs large. i am usually a medium or a 10 and a s worked best. i'm a 36d and there was no pull at the bust. will pick up when on sale (bc a hundo for rayon is laughable).
-1,"Right out of the bag  this top didn't really match the one pictured here (it is the right top  though). the fabric was heavy and felt ""damp"" -- the way something feels coming out of the wash. very odd.  and the fit is nothing like what's shown on the model. the ""v"" is not fitted or nicely wrapped (or even tacked in place) -- it was just two loose  droopy pieces so most of my bra was showing no matter how many times i put the pieces back where they belonged (i'm neither ""flat chested"" nor ""busty"""
0,"I wanted to like this top  as i usually adore a cute peplum feature. when i tried it on yesterday in the store  i was disappointed by how wide and bulky is it. i am petite (5'2""  110 lbs)  and i tried my usual xs. the fabric was substantial and of a high quality  but unfortunately in this design  that became a bad thing as the bottom of the shirt balooned out around me. it was very unflattering and i felt lost in the shirt! definitely try it on for yourself before purchasing."
0,Gorgeous but just too short in length for anyone with a long torso.  i sized up to get more length  but then the neck opening was way too big and hung open to expose - well  everything up top.  wearing a cami would be an option but would take away from the dressiness of the top.  i had to leave without this item  but was disappointed because i love the colors and cut otherwise!
-1,"I'm a fan of yumi kim dresses and consistently wear size small. so  i ordered this in a small  and the top was a little loose  but it was way too short. there's no way i would feel comfortable wearing this in public. i'm 5'7""  and the hem was higher than mid-thigh on me. the waist is also billowy and has no defined shape."
1,I really really like this tunic. it is gorgeous! but it runs small. i tried in l  usually wear l/xl  i may need to try the xl. but i sent it back because it just too expensive. the fabric itself is thick and heavy. i didn't like the fabric much  i wish it were softer. especially for such a gorgeous tunic. it was hard to send it back  but i may try the larger size in the store. i think i need 2 sizes up  it runs too small.
1,These give an amazing slimming effect and i love the dark wash and fit on the waist. only negative is that being 5'4 and a size 30 the length of the pants is a few inches too long for me. i still love them but will have to wear heels with them always.
0,Overall construction/craftmanship of skirt is poor- the dots were sewn in on the seam- some dots didn't lay flat on side by seam- looked like some dots were missing around the top part of skirt in back- ( very disappointed in the quality from retailer- my last 3 or so orders have been similar complaints with their items- sad!!!)
-1,Like the previous review said  i was excited to receive this top. i had grand visions of all the ways i could wear it! to my chagrin  when i put it on  it just fell right down and pooled around my waist. i wish there were smaller sizes to order. sadly  this is going back.
-1,It's like a work of art  but sadly  not flattering on me. i absolutely loved the look  and even considered taking it to a tailor  but the material overall is very stiff. if you're teeny tiny and need something to give you the illusion of hips  you might love it. very sad to return this.
0,So comfortable and soft but starting pilling after one wear! sending back.
0,The embroidery on the side is cute  and they're nice and airy for hot days. however  the stitching on the legs unraveled after only two washes. also  they're extremely long; i'm 5'7 and had to take them up around 3 inches.
1,This is the prettiest little nighty. it is romantic  soft and so very pretty. i really adore everything about this piece   but the pink detail on the trim  along with the floral embroidery is are just the right extra touches that retailer shoppers have come to love.
-1,"I love everything by cloth & stone so was excited to see that they made a dress. hooray! i ordered it in the xl  which is my usual size in their shirts. when i tried it on i was so sad to see that it barely fit around my tummy and hips! i am a true size 12/14 and the xl just barely gave me enough room to move. my chest also caused the dreaded ""button gape."" it is clear that they cut the dress for people with a stick straight figure. so disappointing!!"
0,Has anybody washed this shirt a second time? just curious if it continues to shrink.
-1,This shirt was great for one wear. after just one wash (followed instructions to dry clean) it lost all shape and now hangs like a bed sheet. terrible waste of money on a pricey top.
-1,A beautiful shawl but not practical. i was impressed with how elegant/romantic it first felt/looked.  however  after 5 minutes of wear  it would not stay on my shoulders. the design is very awkward and despite several attempts with different tops/tanks underneath  i kept running into the same problem. lovely for the first 5 minutes of wear and then awkwardly/annoyingly wouldn't stay on my shoulders. the neckline is undefined and it just fell off. not a great design. disappointedly returned it.
0,While the fabric  embroidery and sizing are dead on  i just couldn't deal with the shiny little mirrors that the designer embellished this shirt with. that detail is not apparent in the photographs and i felt lessened the versatility of this blouse. so  it must go back to retailer.
0,The blue has three colors of stripes: blue  white and black 9between white and blue). the black stripe made it too busy for me. the material is soft and clingy. i followed the advice of previous reviewer and sized up to a m (normally wear s). the shirt fit as pictured on the model  not tight but form fitting.
0,I ordered the pink in size xl. the color was pretty. the problem is the material was too thin and tight. it ran at least a size smaller than shown in the photos online.
1,Really cute tee... charcoal is deep and great all seasons. cut high on sides... may need to size up to accommodate - depends on body shape. tried the white  didn't buy--- too lightweight  but could work layered.
-1,I was so excited to buy it online  but it come in a small plastic bag  and lot of pieces are missing on the one i got  so i had to return it
-1,"This is a pretty dress  but the cut is quite boxy. i had thought that the dress would cut in a bit along the body and then ""flare out"" more around the waist down to the hem; however  the dress is baggy from the sleeves all the way down  which lends to a rather unflattering look."
-1,Oh elevenses  i love your pants..the fabrics  the details  the length. i've found elevenses to be classic work pants. reliable  professional  well made. these are none of those things. the cardinal trousers are thin and the rise feels much higher that's it appears in the picture. the red pair are thin  stretchy and cheap. both pairs have to go back. i'm truly sad.
-1,"Like another reviewer mentioned  this shirt is way too short. i'm only 5'2"" (xs) and there is no way this top would tuck in like on the model. also  the quality isn't great as it's very thin and there are strings hanging from some of the seams in the front. it's a shame b/c the print is really pretty and there is this cute little bicycle charm on the tag which makes it feel more unique. sadly  it's going back!"
1,This bra surprised me by how good it looks on. the placement of the lace and cups creates a flattering silhouette.
0,I had such high hopes for this dress and really wanted it to work for me. i initially ordered the petite small (my usual size) but i found this to be outrageously small. so small in fact that i could not zip it up! i reordered it in petite medium  which was just ok. overall  the top half was comfortable and fit nicely  but the bottom half had a very tight under layer and several somewhat cheap (net) over layers. imo  a major design flaw was the net over layer sewn directly into the zipper - it c
0,The sleeve detail is cute and well done. the fabric is nice quality  but the body of the shirt really doesn't have any shape.
1,"I agree with the other review that the dress runs big and long  but i love it! it's very flattering and i have super high wedges that work great with it. i don't think it runs ""super big"" but it's slightly big. definitely size down if small busted. i wore it out and got a ton of compliments. it's classy  different and hot!"
0,"The suit is beautiful  however the white it is slightly see-through on the bottom front. even though it is slight  to me that is inappropriate...so i returned it. regarding sizing  i ordered a medium  i usually wear a size 6 (135lbs) and my body is evenly proportioned throughout. the medium was not tight at all but the back bottom region seemed cut just slightly less than ""full coverage"". i feel that i would be in-between sizes small and medium but did not try a small due to the slightly transpa"
-1,"This dress looks great online with boots as shown. when it arrived and i tried it on  it fit great on my arms  wasn't too tight on my neck  but once it went down over my chest (36c)  the dress never came back ""in"" to show my feminine waist/shape. it just looked like a big trash bag on me  very disappointing! similar to a mumu."
1,I ordered this online  but i own the vest and i love it  so i took a chance. this is a super comfy  great quality jacket. the sleeves are some kind of knit material and that makes it really cozy and not constrictive. the color  i ordered the green  is perfect. i ultimately returned the jacket because i thought the lapels were just too wide for my liking. they look exactly like the picture so if you don't mind that  you will probably be very happy with this jacket. it just wasn't for me. i ended
1,When i walked into the store  this tee instantly caught my eye. it's light weight  not too low cut and longer in the back. great with jeans  skirts or shorts.
0,"I'm keeping this top bc it was on sale but it does look a little maternity! i wore with super skinny white jeans and 3"" casual heel. i'm short so i needed a little more height to slim me but if your tall and and slender this might work better for you?"
-1,I ordered this skirt in a size small and when i received it  not only was it too long  but there was also a hole in it. so i returned it. when a small petite became available  i ordered it thinking it would fit better. i just received it and there is a hole in this skirt as well. both skirts also looked as if they had been worn; there was fuzz and lint all over the skirts. i like the skirt but i either have extremely bad luck or it's really bad quality.
1,Love these jeans however they get a little saggy in the front while wearing which i don't like :/
-1,"There were no reviews  it's an ""online exclusive"" and thought it might look good with a nice skirt at an upcoming wedding. the spandex jersey back looks like sweat shirt material. on the white version of this  it is mismatched with an oatmeal color and white that just looks awful. as a busty 36d i was stunned to find myself swimming in a medium. it does not look like the photograph and the sleeve billow out. i feel like this had to have been clipped and tucked in for this photograph. i'm an anth"
1,I love the fit of this tee for everyday wear. it's forgiving on my late 30s mom body and looks much more stylish than the average tee. my only complaint is that the fabric started pilling on the second wear. otherwise the fit  style  and fabric weight are great. it fits tts. i'm usually a size 4 and the small fits perfectly.
1,I'm a big fan of left of center as a brand  and this top is definitely a winner!  the deep green is gorgeous and looks fantastic with denim. the shirt is true to size and is flatteringly loose without looking too tent-like. highly recommend!
1,As in most ribbed camis  this stretches out - so size down. it is very pretty/delicate (e.g. fabric is thin) and the silver/grey color has metalic thread running through. plan to pair it with an retailer grey bolero sweater for the holidays.
1,This sweater poncho is a nice versatile piece to wear in the fall. wear a blouse or tee under for extra warmth for the maine winters. love the side buttons and the uniqueness of this poncho. true to size  great color. lot's of compliments.
1,I agree completely with the previous reviews suggesting that this top is much prettier in person! i failed to notice this top online  but was drawn to it in the store (the green color). it is perfect for early fall weather. although i could probably wear the xs  i ordered the xxs online after trying on the xs because i wanted it to be a bit shorter and have less extra fabric in hopes that it would be just that much more flattering.
-1,I was very disappointed with my recent retailer order. i ordered the meleri eyelet tank and it had a stain on the front. i also order a dress that came with a tear in the fabric. sale items should not be damaged unless the customer is aware of the damage and accepts it in that condition. very disappointing.
1,"Had the same inconsistent sizing issue in coral as miss janeausten. i ordered 2 corals  one in s & one in xs & the s was very much smaller than the xs as i could barely get my arms into the s (while my arms were loose in the xs). keeping the ""larger than s"" xs coral - the color is just lovely. also ordered the ivory in both ps & pm & keeping the pm as i like the longer arm length to cover my hands (for sun protection when i want/need). because you can cinch the waist tightly  a looser jacket sti"
1,I liked this sweater in the picture but was less impressed when i saw it in the store. it looked a bit odd and perhaps cheap to me. still i decided to leave it on my wish list and got it as a christmas gift. once i tried it on  i really liked the way it looked and felt! it's flattering  comfortable and looks great with jeans! it's really cozy! i rated it tts but you could almost size down on it.
1,Love this skirt! it's definitely on the tight side  but is a stretchy material. i'm between a 6 and an 8 and went with the six because i liked the way it hugged my curves. as an hourglass shape i sometimes have problems finding pencil skirts - they either fit in the hips and are big at the waitband or the other way around. this one fit great throughout  and was both slimming in the front and flattering in the back. i was also worried that if i tucked anything into this skirt there would be weird
-1,I love the shirt and it runs true to size everywhere but the arm holes. i bought a size small and the length was great  the fit was great  but the arm holes were gappy and big. i had to return it and was bummed because i loved it otherwise.
1,A truly gorgeous dress. ran a little too small in the shoulders for me so i had to reorder the next size up. its is very long  but i won't hesitate to have it altered. it is stunning!
-1,These pants looked worn  washed & old looking when i received them! the quality is super thin cotton as if it's been washed a million times & is about to fall apart! the workmanship is terrible. you can see loose stitching all over. the top portion is too tight & looks terrible stretched out. i liked absolutely nothing about this pants except the idea of them from the picture online...
0,I stopped into a store near me specifically to try these on given how adorable they look here. while i liked them  i didn't love them. i love some stretch  so that part was good. however  the denim was much thinner and lighter colored than they look to me online here.       i really want to love them  though their light color has me less enthusiastic. another reviewer also mentioned a butt-flattening effect  which i noticed also. i might have sprung for them anyway  they do have a cute shape  bu
1,I agree with other reviews  soft  cozy and love the embroidery and beading. it is a bit wrinkly even after i ironed it but overall happy with this blouse.
0,I ordered this sweater in green in petite large. the color and knit is beautiful and the shoulders and body fit comfortably; however  the sleeves were very long for a petite. i roll them  and it looks okay but would have rather had a normal petite length sleeve.
0,I really liked this cardigan when i saw it today. the cut and detail in the back is slimming and very flattering. i love the idea of the safety pin closure  and i really like how the model wears it in this photo-open with the pin on the side. when i saw this in-store  it was closed in the front with the pin  which i also like. i thought for sure the cardigan was also pinned in back when i saw it in the model  so it looked fantastic. however  when i tried it on myself  it wasn't quite the same.
-1,It runs large. loose or oversized tops don't bother me so i thought it would be fine  but this just made me look wider then i am. is thin and too sheer for me as well. it was just so unflattering. i had to return it.
-1,I so wanted to love the striped peplum top  however i have a petite frame with a large chest and there was absolutely no support in the top. not flattering in the least for a d-dd cup. will be returning. i imagine this would be perfect for someone with a frame like mary kate or ashley olsen :)
0,"I bought this shirt in white and am happy with the fact that it's not too sheer. the back detail is great. my only complaint is that it is too long. i got the small and it fits nicely in the arms and top  but it is much longer on me than on the model. i'm 5'5"" tall. it doesn't look great when i do a half tuck  but it looks fine if i tuck it all the way in. maybe an xs would have been a better fit."

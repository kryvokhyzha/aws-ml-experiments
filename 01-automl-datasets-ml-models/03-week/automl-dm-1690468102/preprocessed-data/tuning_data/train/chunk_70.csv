-1,"This top looks so pretty on the model. however  the photo is deceiving as the bottom section is quite wide and loose. i am petite but between a c+ to d cup. the top is not really fitted  so my bust pushed the top out and made it look like a maternity piece. from the side it hung way in front of my body. i am wondering if this is clipped in the back on the model. if you are smaller chested and taller  this top might look nice on you. i am 5'1""  105 lbs and c-d cup. i really loved the fabric and c"
0,"I love cloth and stone and the softness and prettiness of this fabric did not disappoint. this is not a dress  however. it is a long shirt. the sides were so short the you could see where my bum and hamstrings came together. leggings would ruin the look and as a shirt it would be totally impractical. for reference i am 5'8"" and 130 lbs. the small was the correct size  save for the length."
-1,I was so excited to order this sweater. i thought that the moss color would make it a great basic for work or casual days. ordering it on sale made it all the better. however  when it came i was so sad to see how muted the colors were  with little definition. the sweater itself lacks definition as well  just shapeless and hangy. i also did not expect the angora like hair on the sweater which bothered by eyes as soon as i tried it on.
1,"I like this sweater very much. it's short but not too short  and soft but not fluffy. the design is a little interesting rather than plain and the colors (i ordered the tan) are great for me  a redhead. i'm 5'3""  125 lbs and don't like clingy tops so i took a m and it's perfect. really cutewith jeans."
0,Very cute dress  just way too big. i ordered it online  wish i would have gone a size smaller.
-1,Love the tegan tunic version of this dress. i assumed since it looked identical except for the length that the sizing was the same but i was wrong. this runs so big! i got a s in the tegan but the s in this dress looked like an oversized potato sack on. i highly recommend ordering at least 2 sizes down unless you want to look tent-y.
1,The dress is very pretty! i ordered for a wedding and thought it was a little casual for that. in the end i returned because it wasn't very flattering for my figure.
-1,I'm so upset that this didn't work out. i'm petite at 5'2 and ordered this skirt in petite  however  i felt like it swallowed me up. the fabric is thick and warm so this is definitely only cold weather attire. i'm the picture it looks like there is a little leg showing  but on me  i feel like a schoolmarm. sadly  this is going back.
1,I was unsure about the color when i got it in the mail but it is very flattering. it is roomy for sure. with a pair of slim shorts or pants it looks great though. creasing may be an issue. 5ft 6  135 lbs 36 d...the xs looks good with room to spare.  nice weight fabric for fall.
1,Beautiful dress! vibrant colors. fabric has a nice weight and drapes perfectly. 36 dd up top and the girls have plenty of space.
1,I really like the hyphen pilcro chino pants so i figured i would try the shorts and voila' - i love the shorts too! colors are great and you don't have to cuff them if they seem too short - they're versatile and who doesn't love options?????
-1,Loved the fit and colors  but the fabric is very thin and see-thru. i tried a nude cami underneath and the cami was completely visible. it did not look appropriate for anything that i wanted to wear the top to.
1,Love this top!! i bought it for school and im dying to wear it. i could see how other people could dislike it bc of the loose frame  but if you like flowy shirts this top is for you! i like how the shirt is made of a really soft and sturdy cotton and the top part is more fitted so the fabric doesnt completely drown you out. also  this top looks super cute paired w/ a bralette and espadrilles!
0,This dress has so much potential- loved the pattern and the neckline. however  only one side of the waist was gathered with a fake sash leaving the other side plain. the gathered side was super flattering while the other side showed any little lump or bump. needless to say  i'm returning it.
0,This is completely see-through and i think it would look awkward with a cami underneath because of the highly structured shape. fairly cute fit  but not as a layering piece.
-1,The length of this dress is bizarre.  i can't decide if it's supposed to lay on the floor or not touch it at all - i'm not sure if i like it either way.  also- at this price point  i would have hoped to have the included under layer to not be so transparent.  if you buy this dress  be prepared to invest in a slip and then have the slip tailored to match the high low hem line so that people cannot see your underwear.  the netting and details in this dress are beautiful but delicate- the one i pur
0,The concept of this top is edgy for a sweatshirt fabric. i think it works better on a thin frame instead of my curvy frame. although i appreciate the design  it did not work for me.
0,"I didn't know what to put for ""runs small  true to size  or runs large "" but it required me to put something...i first ordered the xl  and it was ridiculously gianormous. the next time  i ordered a large. i thought the large would either be a perfect fit or still too large  based on how the xl had fit. the large was too tight! i could not believe it! it is too bad  for i love the design and color of this top! i ordered it in the muted red color. if you can find a size that works for you  go for"
-1,Much to my surprise when i tried on this sweater i found that it was cut in a bell shape and not at all fitted or straight like in the photo. when i pulled it out of the package i thought i'd ordered the wrong size because the shoulders looked so narrow. but when i tried it on the shoulders fit perfectly  with beautiful detail and high quality material  but the sweater belling out to a very wide shape. it is very wide at the hip and looks out of proportion. it doesn't look anything like the phot
0,"I am 5'4"" about 120# with an athletic build. i was so excited for this dress to arrive. when i removed it from the package i loved the way it felt and the weight of it. the color was as pictured on my computer. i ordered the xsp and was concerned it would be too small in the shoulders or too short. it was huge on me -- too long -- too wide -- too frumpy -- too loose all over. i checked to make certain it was a petite that was sent and it was. boo. i do like the cap sleeve better than the flutter"
-1,I was really excited about this top since i have others from retailer that are similar in styling. unfortunately  it just didn't work out. i am petite with a short torso and ordered my usual size and it was way too short in the front. the top was also boxy and didn't sit right. it just wasn't flattering. cute top on the hanger  but just not on me.
1,I bought this dress when i saw it go on sale  and i am glad i did! love how it fits the length everything about it. it is true to size and it looks very flattering  i will be wearing it for my anniversary date with my husband. highly recommend! i am 130 lbs  34d  and the size 6 fit perfectly!
0,These were a little baggier than expected and the petite size ran long.
1,Love this cardigan. the quality is beautiful and and comfortable. i think the cable stitching and pockets add such a unique touch.
-1,I really wanted to like this top but unfortunately it was short and the sleeves were just too puffy. it did not look flattering and will be going back.
0,I was excited to order this sweater. when it arrived  the green didn't stand out as much as the picture here. it also felt too itchy. i usually wear either very soft wool or wool with cashmere because i can't stand plain thick heavy wool. this one was just too itchy for me  it is going back.
0,"Loved the material  but i didnt really look at how long the dress was before i purchased both a large and a medium. im 5'5"" and there was atleast 5"" of material at my feet. the gaps in the front are much wider than they look. felt like the dress just fell flat. both were returned. im usually a large and the med fit better. 36d 30 in jeans"
1,Great soft basic. low scoop neck makes this tank flirty while the thicker strap keeps it modest. i absolutely love this top  easily dress up and down!
-1,The skirt that i received had very little blue or green in it  and was mostly white  yellow and some red. the fit was fine but the quality for the price was not there for me. the lack of quality and the disappointment in the quality equals a return.
-1,"I love almost all tops from retailer  however this one was just enormous. it is beautifully designed  but it was so huge when i tried it on that i couldn't believe it was sized 0. i even checked the tag to see if maybe they placed a size 0 tag on an xl shirt. for reference  i am 5'2"" and 110lbs. i would have loved this shirt if it hadn't been so big."
1,This dress is everything. i'm 5'4  athletic build  36d and the medium fit me perfectly. the colors are really understated and beautiful and can easily be dressed up or down. i wish the elastic around the waist fell a little lower but that's one of those things only i notice and definitely didn't keep me from falling in love and buying it. can't wait to wear it on vacation next week!
0,"I've had my eye on this for a while. went into my local retailer to try it on. tried on s and xs. it fit the same  not much different. the color is great. will go with so many things however i have a larger bust 34d-dd and am short wasted  generally wearing petite in skirts because of it. it sort of belled at the bottom  peplum""ish"" which made it look like my bust drooped to my waste. not flattering on me. i'm 5'3ish  118# and generally wear 4 in tops. it felt like it would stretch out as the day"
0,I ordered this dress when it was briefly on sale with an extra percent off. i was very excited to receive it in my usual size large  and wear with a jean jacket and cowboy boots. when i took it out of the package  i could tell it looked really small. i didn't even try it on. i had my daughter who wears a size small try it on  and she couldn't even get it over her hips. if you are tall and thin like the model  it will work for you. it is made of cupro  looks exactly like the photo  the color is g
0,On me this was not good at all. couldn't get it off fast enough. the thick  stretchy fabric instantly added bulk to my frame and the leaf pattern over my mid section emphasized my belly (and i'm a size 2). also  the color is a dark  brick red and i think if it had been a true red it would have been much more attractive.
0,I'm not sure if it was my undergarments or not  but the top clung to me in a strange way. the colors are rich but in addition to the odd fabric  the sleeves did not flatter my upper arms.
-1,I saw this dress and immediately started daydreaming about wearing it while honeymooning in italy along the amalfi coast or the cinque terre with my husband. and then i tried this dress on and immediately woke up. the cut is a disaster  the quality is terrible  and the dress just plain didn't work. the strips of elastic were sewn unevenly  giving the appearance that there was one large breast and one non-existent breast. the neckline was so long that it had to have the elastic run over the outsi
1,This dress ran large on me. i am a 10  sometimes an 8 but went with the 10. it just hung on me  giving me no shape. the colors are pretty and the dress was nice  but i expected it to wow me more for the price. sending back  may try again if the next size makes it to sale.
-1,C'mon. the accent is wrong! a simple google search would prevent this.
0,A few things: this runs very large. i'm usually a s/m (i'm a little busty so i sometimes size up!) and i'll definitely need an xs in this  i'm swimming in the small. the blue is definitely a steel blue/grey  not really navy. the material is very thin - i thought it would be a bit more substantial. it's very lightweight. that said  it's very pretty  i love the neckline which can be worn as a cowl neck or off the shoulder  and i'll give the xs a shot instead!
-1,As much as i buy from retailer  this is my first review. the pictures do not accurately show how large this dress is in person. i wanted something that was a bit flowy  but this was a reminder of little house on the prairie. the most unflattering dress ever and since it's only available online  i'm not interested enough to try a smaller size.
-1,I was worried about this item when i ordered it because of how it looks in the picture  but i had wishful thinking. i should have gone with my gut! this shirt does not have the same quality as all my other retailer purchases. it is see-through and flimsy. the bottom is just like the picture  it hangs in an odd rumpled way. the top is very flattering though  so it's a shame! if the bottom fit nicer like their other products i could have gotten away with wearing a cami under it to make up for the qu
1,I love this fabric  it is comfortable and forgiving. as i prefer jewel tone colors the sapphire is great. i wish it would be offered in red  like the cowl neck long sleeve tee. with that said  i thought the sleeve length on this might be odd  and while i wish it were a few inches longer (3/4 sleeved). the only reason i haven't given it five stars is that i haven't laundered it enough to verify the quality.
-1,Hi  when i received this top i tried it on  looked in the mirror and packed it up for a return. the quality is excellent but it just too boxy. fits nothing like it appears on the model.
0,I had high hopes for this top but it was too big and too much fabric.
-1,"Couldn't make it work  even belted. ivory color is darker irl--dingy light tan  like dirty vintage. ""drop"" waist is not dropped at all  just a maternity-ish cut that starts boxy-loose high up (below bust)  then abruptly flares out at bellybutton level (not low hip) into the skirt. i usually find a-line cuts good at giving illusion of a willowy  curvy waist  but this does not--adds ten pounds. poly fabric heavy/hot; rayon lining awkward and doesn't flow/drape. (5'3'' 127lb 34a  tried xs)"
1,I love this tank  it is casual and comfortable  but has the little scarf attached to it  so sweet and styling. i tried on the xs regular  and would need petite  it was a bit long on me  but some people may prefer that. i also wonder about getting xxs only because it is a looser-fit tank. both colors are nice and neutral  good piece to add to a transition wardrobe. (115 lbs  30 dd  26.5 in waist)
-1,Online  this looks like a great sweater. i ordered an xxsp and found that this sweater is much wider in the middle than pictured. in fact  i'm pretty sure they pinned the shirt in the back for the picture to make it appear slimmer. unfortunately  this sweater will not work for me  as i am an hourglass shape and this shirt makes me look 20 pounds heavier.
0,It's a t-shirt. a very cute print  nice cut  very soft--but a t-shirt. therefore  why is it almost $50???? tried it on in the store and loved it  but i just can't justify $50 for a t-shirt.    for those who will not be deterred by the price: i normally wear about an 8-10 dress size at retailer  and the medium fit well.
-1,I agree with the other reviewer about the great colors  but when i took this off the rack to try one  you can see through both layers of fabric. i thought  insulting quality  for the price. i imagine the holes would start after one wearing.
1,Beautifully designed to flatter a women's figure. i love the fit and feel of this classic  but modern cardigan.
0,Lovely style. i got the navy color and it's beautiful. i'm glad i ordered a smaller size after reading other reviews. my usual size would have been too big and not as figure flattering. but but but the sweater came pilled all over. i don't know if it had been worn and returned or if it's just the quality of the material but seriously there was pilling on the entire sweater. because the style is so nice and it fits well  i'm going to keep it and de-pill it but was disappointed with retailer :(
0,"I like the colors  material and style of this sweater but not a fan of the sizing.  the xs/s was far too short for me and the m/l was great in length but had a tremendous amount of extra volume.  i am 5'/6"" size 8."
-1,I have to agree that the fit is unfortunate. i am using a size 2 in retailer and most dresses. i knew to size up based on reviews here. i tried the size 4 and i could barely button the top. the waist fit fine and the underarms was fitted nicely to the body. i sized up to a size 6 and the dress was oversized in the top  with gaping armholes. too bad because the color is beautiful and the style is adorable.
0,"I'm all over this trend  but this vest is quite thick/poufy  and on me i feel like it triangles out and all you see is furball. i love it - but i think you need some height for this to look its best. on me  a sweater vest would perhaps be better. i am chesty. but i cant decide. its really cute! if you're taller than 5'4"" don't hesitate."
1,"I'm barely 5'4"" and rarely find a maxi that isn't far too long or the other extreme. i prefer mine to just barely reach the ground as opposed to rising 5 inches from the floor for example. this one is perfect with flat sandals. i tried on the 4 and chuckled b/c it was 6"" too long. tried on the 2 and not only was it the perfect length  the bodice fit like a glove. i would say i'm average bust size  always fluctuating but not generally flat-chested. i prefer more conservative sleeveless dresses an"
-1,"First of all  mine arrived in a regular denim shade  not the dark wash shown. also  the style is more like a blazer  and it was huge. i am 5'2"" and ordered the petite xs but even xxs would have looked like a baggy blazer. as well  the sleeves came barely past my wrists  they are designed to cuff as the model has done? perhaps on someone taller and younger it would look edgy and chic! the quality is excellent with some nice details. this might be one to try in person  if you can."
-1,Although i love the soft feel of the sweater  the zig zag design was very unflattering. also  the length is much shorter than appears in the picture. i will be returning it.
1,I bought this dress in the store and realized that it was a little too long for my frame...i'm 5'1. i then found it online in the same size but in petite and it fits perfectly! i got a ton of compliments and i wore it to a holiday wedding and am planning on wearing it to several other occasions over the holidays. would def recommend this dress.
0,I was very excited to get this dress in the mail. i wasn't sure about the sizing because there weren't any reviews written yet. i got the m which fit across my chest area and fit fine  but there was just so much fabric below the bust. i love that it's different  but i think you'd have to be a stick figure for this shape to work for you. it does not flatter your body at all.
1,I really loved the material and the feel of this item  however it does run very large. even though it is meant to be loungewear it is great as a top with skinny jeans or leggings.
1,This is my favorite shirt to wear around the house. it's so soft and the waffle texture looks nice  i'd definitely wear it for a run to the store or an evening walk around the neighborhood. the fabric is thin but isn't too delicate and it's not sheer  which makes it a great summer lounge shirt. the cut is flattering and the back doesn't show my bra  which too many of this design do. it is a bit large  you may want to size down if you want it to be a bit more body conscious.
1,I wore it belted with a close fitting cami beneath because the sweater is open down both sides. be creative and wear it different ways.
1,Love this top  dramatic in a casual way.  i ordered the teal and love love love it....with skinny jeans or leggings the style is perfect !  i am over 50  so the teal is gorgeous and i think very age appropriate.  i ordered the blue also  a very pretty shade of blue.........but felt in this style  the bright/light colors would be more appropriate for someone younger.  it's a stunning top...........and fits very true to size..........the drama of the ruffle is what sets it apart..  hoping they do
0,I loved this sweater when i bought it. wore it a couple times then washed it according to the tag. it shrunk at least two sizes! and the tassels got all tangled (which i guess i should have seen coming). pretty bummed about it because this sweater looked beautiful on.
-1,This is adorable but if it truly has to be dry-cleaned that is deal killer
-1,"I loved this dress when i saw it. however the fit was way off. i am 5'7"" 120 lbs and the small was way too big from the waist down. when the xs arrived i was sure it would be perfect. unfortunately the waist hit way too high  above my rib cage and the dress was too short. it was as if it was a petite size. i was very disappointed as this is such a pretty  easy dress to just throw on for school. unfortunately neither size looked right on me and i had to return both. the material is also not the s"
1,Absolutely in love with this top. the embroidery and back button detail make for a unique and fun look. light and airy material will be perfect in warmer weather with a cute pair of shorts. i got a size small and it fits perfectly. measurements: 5'4  135lbs  32e
1,The petite was a little bit long on me (i'm 5'2)  but it otherwise fits true to size and is very soft and comfortable  breezy. covers enough that it is work appropriate or for something outside. a keeper!
1,I love this. it is perfect. it is sheer  but i wear a black cami underneath and it looks great. so glad antro finally has something with a waist! the small metal buttons are a really nice added detail. i wish you would make more tops with a defined waist like this one!
1,Love this tee  purchased the blue and white  i usually wear xs in many retailer items but opted for a medium in this tee so it would fit loose. works good not fitting too tight. i like it because it's a tee shirt but it's a little dressy  great for going out to dinner  etc...
0,I didn't realize it had a tie around the waist. it seems too much material hanging in the front to tie at the waist. unfortunately the sash is attached and cannot be removed. it's very cute; just not for me.  i will have to return (but sure i can find something else)!
0,So this shirt is adorable. soft  fun  lays nicely...  but you should have your arms amputated and replaced with a barbie's before you put it on.   i don't even have large arms  the medium fit me perfectly  but then like i hulked out the arms and there are now little tears at the seams. this was all very confusing and vexing as this shirt is otherwise perfection.     i mean  i'm not a large? but i guess if i want this shirt  i will need to take it back and get a large  otherwise  it will be sleev

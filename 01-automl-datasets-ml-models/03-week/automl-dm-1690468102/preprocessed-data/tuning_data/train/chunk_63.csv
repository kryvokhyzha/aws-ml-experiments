0,Delaine blazer so many little details with a slight bit of ruggedness. loved the unmatched buttons  checkered back and fraying that gave this piece personality making it appear less stuffy. easyily dress it up or down  that being said it seems to run true to size except the arms and shoulders were very tight. i would consider going up a size if more of an athletic build. ordered a 4 but i think a 6 would have been perfect!
-1,These look nothing like the picture! they are super high-waisted & longer than they look in this picture. i felt as if i was wearing a pair of jeans from the 90's that just fit terribly. i thought they were going to be a pair of cropped wide legs & they are far from it. the color was also much lighter than shown in picture. super unflattering & just not for me. they're going back...
1,A slip underneath makes this dress substantial. it's a good 'weather' transition dress-fall/spring. the lace is very pretty and it's an overall great dress that will take you anywhere. i plan to wear burgundy tights and brown boots with ti next weekend.
-1,Dress is pretty  i was disappointed by the slip which is too small like previous customer. i am an inch taller than the model and i feel more comfortable it being a tunic with leggings. nice but not nice enough to keep  i am returning. :(
0,I was so excited to try this on--but this was a big nope for me unfortunately. i ordered both an xs and s (i normally wear a s)  both hung horribly on me  they were just too big. i love a boxy  oversized silhouette but this sadly didn't flatter me in the least.
0,I wanted something for the hot summers here  and this fits the ticket. very lightweight and airy. it's somewhat of a strange design  short in the front  hitting an inch or two above the knee  but the back is unusually long. the lining is awkward  and kind of tight and difficult to get into. the material is very thin  and although i haven't noticed any strings or unraveling like other reviewers  it's not the highest quality. overall the dress is nice and lightweight  but not the greatest quality
1,I have this in the blue/teal color  and i love it  so far! i'm considering buying it in other colors. this tee is stretchy  comfortable  and soft  even after being washed a few times. it fit true to size on me (xs)  although it's a bit form-hugging  so if you want a looser fit  consider sizing up. the only thing about the blue is that it's not quite as dark as in the photo on the website. i wish retailer would make these kinds of basic tees more often!
0,"I was so excited to get this dress; i ordered the red  and it's a beautiful  vibrant  festive color. i am small-busted  5'3"" and 120 lbs  and i got the regular xs  which fit very well  fitted but not too tight. i normally order petite  but i wanted the dress to hit a little lower on me than on the model; it ended up just above my knee  and i was happy with that. the shape is very flattering and i really like the scallop detail on the back v. the fabric looks substantial but isn't super heavy? an"
-1,I really loved the colors and style of this top. unfortunately it runs a bit small and was too short on me. i'm 5'9. some mentioned they didn't like fabric but i thought it was good!
1,It's definitely not a $100  blouse  but i took advantage of the sale on sale and gotta say i love it! it's slightly sheer  but with a plain nude bra it's fine. beautiful details  very retro  light and breezy. wearing it to work and with jeans.
0,At first i was interested. i liked the color  the soft tencel fabric  the cut in the back. it was all good. they didn't have my size in the store so i had to order it. when it arrived in the mail it was folded up and wrinkled. i tried it on and it looked like a lifeless unstructured blazer. i sent it back.   all in all  it is cute and fun for warm weather. it is definitely a casual blazer. i'd probably wait for a sale on this one.  it does run tts.
1,I buy everything that retailer sells in chambray. this top did not disappoint. it is so comfortable and the back the way it is slightly lower than normal is very sexy without being revealing. the straps fall off of your shoulders a bit but i do not find it annoying. i am not big busted so i didn't have the sizing issue that others seemed to have.
-1,Although this has a nice design and i wanted to love it  it already looked ruined in the store with pulls all over each one i found. the fit is nice but i wouldn't buy it due to the material being too delicate.
1,"The fit and design are interesting. in the 00p  the fit was good though the dress was not easy to get into or out of - strategy required. the quality is fine. but the color was very ""blah "" with too little of the bright stripes in an otherwise rather dull color scheme. that made the dress overall feel too busy and rather confused. with the lining and material weight  it would be more a cold weather item only  not an all seasonal dress.  generally  it was interesting but not a ""most come home wit"
-1,I thought from the picture this would be a light floaty top. when it arrived  the fabric was a heavy knit and the neckline sagged very low. on me (granted i'm a pear) the bottom layer hugged my tummy and rear in a very unflattering way. the only thing i liked was the color. back it went.
1,Great top! a little large  but i shrank it a little in the wash  and it fits a little better now. i love the structure and pattern of this top  as well as the lovely coral/orange color. it can be dressed up or dressed down! love it!
0,I bought this jumpsuit in both fabrics. i adored the fit and feel of both  but sadly  the graphic fabric was not handled well in the construction. three examples: a thin white piece along one leg seam made it look like a hole; mismatched large pieces of white in the crotch area looked sloppy and wrong; worst of all  a diagonal was placed on both breast pieces  but they were different angles  which again looked sloppy and wrong in a place where you really want it to look neat and right. too bad b
0,Very pretty dress and nicely made (the embroidery is quite lovely and double lining  as mentioned by the other reviewers  is awesome)  but not a good shape for me and my hourglass figure. like a lot of swing dresses  it has no structure  and it's not a good look on someone a little busty  as i am. in all honesty  i thought the sack-like shape of the dress made me look 20 lbs heavier than i am. i am a medium  size 6-8  and took the 8 based on the other reviews. i probably could have sized down to
0,"I love the idea of this coat and foolishly purchased other items in happy anticipation of its arrival.    the description does not say ""lined "" and i hoped for soft wool that i recently got on the ""yellow with white piping"" sweater coat. this is hard  coarse  itchy wool - impossible for me to wear an unlined garment. i am consistently puzzled by the high prices for garments that are unlined when they really need to be. it went back  and i cannot really recommend this as i know i am not the only"
1,Agreed that the pictures do not do this top justice. it's got shiny threads woven in the fabric and gives off an iridescent  colorful sheen. it can be dressed up or down  worn with a number of various styles - jeans  dress pants  skirts. the back adn arms are a tweed sweater knit  the front is an unforgiving acetate - dry clean only - hand wash will ruin this piece! i normally wear a small  but it was tight in the chest (34c) so i went with a medium and it worked fine.) no stretch in the acetate
1,Such a festive sweater and i've received many compliments anytime i wear it. unique and fun to wear!
1,I'm keeping this dress but it's going straight to the dry cleaner because right out of the bag it has a very strong chemical smell... like it had been stored in a gas station. then  i'm replacing all the buttons. the fabric is a thick eyelet  folded over with these teeny  thin shell buttons that are a complete design fail. two were broken right out of the package. also  i'm a size 0 in most retailer dresses and this dress has plenty of room in the waist  almost too much space  but the top... i hav
1,I am not really a fan of jumpsuits/rompers/etc. but i love this jumpsuit. very good quality and design. fits well  but i thought the 4 was pretty large for a 4. i mean  i probably should have gotten a 2 (which was sold out)  but i don't usually have to get a 4 tailored. i did in this case  but it was still worth it.
-1,Unforgiving to even your smallest imperfections.
-1,How cute was this little sweater and comfortable even in the south .... until i washed it! i followed the instructions on the label being careful not to wring it out. first of all  the smell was unbelievable! i washed it three days ago and it is still wet and damp and on top of that  it shrunk. even though i handwashed it  line dried it and pampered it to no end!
0,Based on previous reviews  i sized up to size 4 - i typically wear xs or s. while the length was okay  the body was way too wide! the neck was almost like a mock neck & higher than i expected which made it very uncomfortable for me! overall  i didn't find it flattering or anything special.
1,I am normally a size m  sometimes a small. i ordered a small based on the reviews and it was so huge i could have been six months pregnant and it would still fit. i would need to size down to an xxs  but at this point i'm returning it....gorgeous colors. i wish it fit :(
-1,Looked good in pictures. i even ordered an xxs petite and it was huge! although the sweater has interesting textures and is very beautiful  it is very awkward and poor fit. will be sending back.
1,"This top is full of amazing details. the photos really don't do it justice. it is very flowy and does run large but is so pretty and soft and in beautiful shades of blue. i bought a small and it is fairly long in back on my 5'5"" frame but because of the detailing...it just works."
-1,I am petite (5'). even the xsmall petite looked sloppy on me. i also disliked the nude fabric under the lace- it made it look cheap. i wanted this to be the perfect lbd  i  just couldn't make it work on my body.
0,Gorgeous in every way except its length and how it hangs at the bottom. i prefer a shirt i can wear tucked in or out. this one will work well tucked in but not out so i am returning disappointed it was so well done in other particulars.
1,This cape is stunning! the perfect addition to any closet. it can be worn to a formal or out to dinner with jeans. the fur is so soft and the quality is superior. it has real fur hooks (four) to close it and the side pockets are adorable. definitely a buy and a bargain on sale!
-1,After reading the previous reviews i thought sizing down would be a great idea. as soon as i pulled it out of the bag i knew that the xs/s was still wayyy too big. for reference i am 5'3 and a 34ddd and usually wear an 8 but this thing was enormous. it was shapeless and boxy but done so horribly it looked like i was pregnant. it has an adjustable draw string at the bottom which helps to make you look like a balloon. such a disappointment. the design was lovely and it looked very high quality and
1,I ordered ivory in xl because this brand tends to run tight if you're well endowed. it's a beautiful color and i love the contrasting plaid lining the inside of the collar and cuffs. haven't decided about keeping it because it looks oversized (but cozy) and it's really long. it almost touches the top of my knees in back. sooooo pretty though.
-1,An absolutely gorgeous  but poorly fitting blouse. the bottom part is way too billowy and inconsistent with the fitted top half. got it on sale and still returned it.
-1,I love the photo of this and because the reviews were so positive i ordered it. i was shocked when i opened the package. first  the fabric is not the silky rayon cotton blend i was expecting. it looks and feels more like a cheap cotton. it does not have the drape or feel or look i expect in a kimono  which brings me to the second disappointment. it is not a kimono at all. it has no kimono sleeve  no sleeves at all in fact. just a slit in the side of the body of the garment you put your arm throu
-1,"I was so excited about this skirt and pairing it with a cute blouse for the warmer weather. as i took out the skirt out of the package and flipped it around  the back has mesh strips that are see through! there is also no lining to go with this skirt. if you go back to the ""back view"" picture on the website and zoom in closely  you can see the model's black underwear."
1,Love the feminine take on flannel and how it fits like a tailored shirt. i am a bit long waisted and the side slit reveals a little too much when i lift my arms. if the shirt was just a little longer it would be perfect.
0,Tried on the xxs petite and still felt that it looked too boxy and baggy on me. cute concept but poor execution
-1,Cute enough  but i couldn't figure out what to do with the tie that didn't make it look like an extra set of sleeves  oddly placed.
1,I read the reviews prior to purchasing but loved the pattern so much i had to have it. i was not disappointed however  had i not read the reviews i would have been. it is true the top of the dress is flat and does not have the detail as shown on the model. it also appears to be disproportionate. i am 5'1 and curvy the bottom fits well but the top is large however rectified by wearing a padded bra. since i ordered the petite i was surprised the dress was above the ankle (usually their items are l
0,"I ordered this top in 2 colors because i thought it would be great with leggings. i always love my retailer purchases  but this fell a little short. i think it may be the type fabric it is  but the way the back hangs so low on my frame (5'4"") it doesn't drape nicely over my leggings. the style of the top is very cute and maybe if i wanted it for skinny jeans  it would be ok. i returned them both to the store.  this is one that would be better to try on first..."
-1,This shirt is unflattering and boxy. it does not look cute at all on me. i am returning.
0,This was huge on me! otherwise i thought it was a nice top  slimming. i didn't bother looking for another size  though. i got a medium. i wear a small or medium.
-1,I wish this fit me better. i love the inside fur. it is extremely soft but it doesn't look flattering at all. it makes my shoulders look really broad and it was shorter in the length than i wanted. it wanted it fit over my butt (or cover half) and it sits a little below my waist. unfortunately i am taking it back. great idea though.
-1,I ordered a small from the online shop knowing it would be drapey  but it's much more than drapey. and the front draping looks like halloween costume material - not chic or sophisticated. sadly  i will be returning this top.
1,This is a super flattering  cute tank! i've purchased it in several colors because it's such a great fit. somewhat thin material and slightly sheer (especially the white). i like that it has good coverage on the sleeves so that bra straps nor 'side boob/armpit' fat shows. looks great with pilcro capris for a cute  casual summer look! i wish they would come out with even more colors!
-1,I love the way this dress hangs straight down on the model  but on me it looked tacky.  i'm 5'6 and 130 lbs  and this dress hit me in all the wrong places.  i got a size small- sizing up would be huge in the top of the dress (and the arm holes are already dangerously large).  i wish this were just a little bit a-line.  instead  it's literally like someone just extended the length of a t-shirt.
0,"I have other pairs of stevie jeans and looked forward to receiving these.i would say that they run about a size large compared to my other pairs. i am 5'2"" and ordered a petite  but i found the length to be about 2-3 inches too long. as compared to how they look on the model. also  the rise is relatively low. otherwise  the quality is great  and the denim is very soft. i will probably return these given that i am not wowed."
0,I had high hopes for this coat  but it was a miss for me. while the wool is soft and not itchy  the colors are a lot duller in person and the embroidery looks messy.  also  the fit runs large with an unflattering poof in the back where the pleat is located.  i thought about keeping it since i liked how soft the wool was  but alas  i just could not get over the poor tailoring.  for reference i am usually a pxxs ( 5ft2in 105 lbs) and it was big.
-1,I ordered this in cream during the 25% sale. i had seen one at the store and thought it was very pretty  but it was not my size  so i didn't try it on. when it arrived  it was a wrinkled mess. it was so wrinkled that i don't think i would be able to iron it satisfactorily. i was also disappointed in the fabric of the dress layer. it almost looked flocked and i wonder if something is wrong with this dress in particular. it was also way too short for me. i'll be taking it back very soon. i do plan
1,Very flattering dress but i think the black is more of a washed out navy/black instead of a true black which made matching this with other black times (cardigan  tights etc) difficult.
0,I love the look of this pullover  however  it was too short and heavy for my small frame with narrow shoulders. sleeves were too long as well.
1,"I didn't think i would like this blouse when i saw it on the website but once i tried it on i was sold. yes  it is see-through but with a cami underneath this blouse can be worn both casually and to work. the best feature? even though it's silk and the tag says ""dry clean only""  you can absolutely hand wash this blouse in cold water and air dry. i did and it came out perfect with no wrinkles! i took my usual small (i'm 32c and 122 lbs) and love how versatile this blouse will be."
0,"The material of the dress is gorgeous  but the armholes droop much too low under the arms. in addition  i am fairly broad shouldered and the cut across the chest is too narrow  exposing your ""chicken wings"" in an unflattering way. this is gorgeous on the model  so i would say narrow shouldered girls should order a size down and give it a shot!"
0,I loved these on the hanger when i saw them in the store. i liked the fabric  but found the full cut of the pant added a ton of bulk to my hips (and i don't have big hips). i also thought the waist was a bit snug while the rest of the pant ran tts. they went back.
0,This vest was of excellent weight but it had very little style. it was like a giant piece of felt was cut out with little thought to design or nuance. not for me.
1,"This sweater is very comfortable and soft. unlike other reviewer  i did not find the lace to be itchy. i'm 5'4""  usually size 6; decided to order medium to give it a nice and relaxing feel. this way i find it to be not too short nor fitted. it's easy and relaxing but the lace makes it a little more dressy. not sure how it's going to handle the wash."
1,"I wasn't going to even try to see it this dress would fit.  it just seemed like such an unflattering silhouette since my body is nothing like the model.  i'm so glad i gave it a try because this dress is cute and comfy and looks great on me when i belt it!  my outfit is a floppy straw hat  skinny leather belt and flat sandals.  there's a lot of fabric but it gathers well without poofing out.  i ordered the medium petite and i am 5'3"" 36dd 140#."
-1,Great color but frumpy fit. if you have any bust  it looks a bit like maternity
0,Nice soft jeans  cute style  and i wish i could keep them...they just are too small on me. :/ not sure if i've gained weight (which i don't think i have because i had on a size 28 pair of pants today) but i ordered a size 29 in these jeans and they zipped but just too snug around the waist. i would honestly need a 30 or 31. looks like they are selling out quickly so i doubt i'll be able to get the size i need.   if you have a small waist i think they would be fine but they don't fit my body type
0,"I finally ordered this at this incredible mark downed price...but i see why. it is cute  but serious size issues  i have a bust but smaller everywhere else but i did order up because of it being a jumpsuit...i would have needed 6"" more to even zip the top part! i have many trendy jumpsuits in my closet and this is a first! if you are flat chested you may want to try at this great price as it would be a great piece for sitting by the fireside next fall/winter...never too soon to plan ahead!"
-1,This dress looks cute online  but it is enormous. i bought a small  but it looked more like a 3x plus size. i tried it on  just in case  and honestly it looked like a great dress for a clown. this dress must have had two feet of fabric pinned behind the model in the photo.
-1,"Looks beautiful in the photo and the color in person is beautiful but it runs so so large that i think even an extra small would be too large for me. just for comparison  and i wish all reviewers would include this  i am 5'5"" and weigh 120 pounds. i ordered a medium which a small to medium is my usual size but i ordered the medium because i wanted to have room to wear something under it. i could have worn two sweatshirts under this sweater. unfortunately i have returned it."
0,I bought the orange in xxs petite  and the cream in the xsp as it did not come in xxs.    i like a swing style  but this is a tent. the material in the cream is fairly sheer  and i found hanging threads that came from suspect seams. the overall effects was being lost in all the fabric. they rather skew old school maternity in summation. mine are going back.
0,The design of this dress is very cute  but if you have an average to large bust  don't even think about it. returned  unfortunately.
-1,I purchased this in-store in a vivid red color  but didn't try it on until i got home. big mistake! literally the first time i tried to zip the dress  the cheap  horrible zipper noted in previous reviews just...broke. midway up  right under the waist tie. i was trapped in the dress for a good 15 minutes and was scared i'd have to rip or cut the fabric to get out of it; eventually i pulled the zipper apart to escape. can't wait to return this asap.
-1,"I really wanted to love this dress  but i think the proportions are very weird. i'm 5'7"" and usually go for an eight in unstructured dresses and a 10 in more structured dresses. it runs small throughout  and is too short for me to feel comfortable wearing to work. the front is nicely detailed  but the back looks weirdly forgotten and could use more detailing. i tried on three different sizes (8 10 and 12) and they all pulled weirdly at the chest. there's a little slip that goes with the dress  w"
1,"My husband rarely seems this pleased and he always likes to see what i try on. oohs and aaaahs galore with this one! let's let him review this one....he says he loves the vibrant color  length  and the way the top is perfectly fitted. he was impressed with the lining and the ""mesh"" at the hem that keeps the 'flare' in the skirt (i had to explain that one)! he likes the way it looks with a sweater and without and said that i could use more than one of the many pairs of shoes with it that he sees"
1,Perfect shirt for a low-key day at the office. bought in the umbrella/rain (white) print. maeve blouses tend to run a little big on me but that's what i love about them. material is nice  recommend hand wash!

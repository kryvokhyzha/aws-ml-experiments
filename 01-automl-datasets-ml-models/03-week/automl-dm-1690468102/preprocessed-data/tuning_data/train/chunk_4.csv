-1,The catalog shot and model shot are completely different. it's like not even the same dress. the neckline  color  the quality of lace
1,Love this shirt! it runs a bit big  i ordered the (petite) 4 and its a bit long in the sleeves if i don't roll them up  and a bit long and big in the back. but i love the look and it is classic. great with skinny jeans.
0,The top for this suit is great - i'm pretty small up top so it's rare that i find a suit that doesn't gap. however  the bottoms run so small. for reference  i'm a size 0 in dresses and 2/4 in pants. i ordered the xs and s to start  both were too small. with high hopes that i could keep this adorable suit (and well made otherwise!)  i ordered a size m bottom. they were still small. sadly  i'm giving up and returning.   only order this suit if you're super  super tiny on the bottom.
1,"Falls nicely. pretty peachy pink color. darker than pictured. bought sz l  5'8"" 175lbs  am busty. very nice fabric  prone to wrinkles."
-1,Disappointment city with this one and i am so lucky i had a coupon because if i would have paid the full $128 they are asking  i would be a tad skewed. not just thin material but thin and cheap feeling. doesn't itch but i seriously expected a lot more from retailer. i have noted the name of the designer and have promised myself to never buy this label again. big loser.
0,I got this top planning to wear it with the sleeves up rather than off the shoulder  like in one of the photos. my regular size (medium) was way too large so i went down to a small. however  the collar was still too wide for the sleeves to stay above my bra straps. back it goes. if you're looking for a strictly off-the-shoulder top  you might like it. color is deep blue and the cotton is a nice weight.
1,But tight around the chest  i ordered xs petite after trying on xxs petite and both are a tad tight on the chest area  kept xs petites as bigger would be too much fabric everywhere else. green color is classic  and the back is longer than the front. overall flattering if with the right outfit. i'm 30 dd and 115 lbs for reference.
0,"I was hoping to wear this dress on my wedding day before the ceremony. i'm 5'5""  130 pounds  usually wear a 6. i ordered this dress in medium and it hangs off of me. it is not straight as it looks on the model  but bells out from the waist. the sleeves are so long that they covered my fingers."
-1,I ordered this in size xl and ended up returning it as soon as i received it. the color was just as pretty in person. the thick eyelet panel was well done. the problem is the whole tank was much smaller/tighter than pictured. i have several tops from this maker and was surprised how this was cut too small compared to their normal fit. i'm pear-shaped  so the hip area looked terrible. but  the whole top just wasn't up to the typical fitting standards for xl. retailer has done much better in the pas
-1,This dress looks very beautiful on the model shown. unfortunately  when i tried it on  it did not flow as nicely as i would have liked it to. i also didn't care much for the waist ties on the side. an elastic waist might have been better.
0,I carry my weight on my lower half  usually a large in bottoms. this one in a large was too big throughout especially since it doesn't have a waste band. returned.
-1,I would really like this dress if the material were a little thicker. it's really thin so you can see my nipples straight through the dress. you can't wear a bra with it because it is backless so i don't understand how you are supposed to wear this outside of the house.
1,This sweater is so soft and warm and i love it with the matching leggings. i say it is true to size  however i ordered it a size up so that it covers the bottom/crotch area when i am wearing the leggings. normally wear an xs  ordered a small and it works well. it is very well made. i absolutely love it!
1,I was a little hesitant about this dress at first because it looks a bit baggy on top on the model. but decided to order it online anyway based on reviews. well i must say  i'm so glad i did! i really love the shape of this dress. i'm heavy on top but it somehow minimizes that and it also accentuates my waist. the dress is very well made. if you order the right size for you  the slip dress will stay in place. i'm going to style it with high black platform heels  but i also like it with boots as
-1,I ordered this top on line. i wanted to love it  but unfortunately the fit was not for me. i am 5'9 with a long torso. this top was cut very wide and looks like a maternity top.
0,The detail on this top is beautiful  love the embroidery ! i wanted it to work so bad  but it is much too wide  bells out and makes my size 8/10 body look wider than it is  another reviewer mentioned the model must have it pinned on the sides  because the top does not lay like that. it runs large  especially under the arms. too bad......
0,I'm an xl in retailer tops  and the xl fit as expected in this blouse. however  the elastic cinched in such a way under my bust that it did not look flattering. the cut in the sleeves hang open too much for me and makes it more of a costume. i also had issues that the chiffon type sleeves did not match the color of the knit fabric used in the rest of the blouse. the blouse is a good quality  but there were too many other issues for me to keep it.
-1,After reading the previous review  i was pretty confident in ordering this dress. it arrived in the mail today  and i was so disappointed. first of all  it's huge. the medium was way too big on me  and i'm never a small at retailer! (i even considered ordering the large in this - my normal size at retailer.) second  the colors are not as vibrant as in the photo  and the fabric felt cheap. finally  it just looked like i went to hawaii and bought a drab dress there that didn't fit right.
1,I am a sucker for bows  so decided to try this one and ordered it. i went with the petite  without trying on the regular size (in hindsight  i should have ordered both)  but tit fit very nicely in petite  so keeping it. length is as on the model  right at hip  the colros of hte bow are well represented on the picture  light pink  light mustard yellow and navy  so i stil lthink it is neutral ebough to mix with other colors: warm or cold palette. love hte button detial in the back  i ordered xs an
-1,"What a shame this dress is. i wear xl and am 5'2""  but the dress in the store in the size xs(!!!!!) looked just the right size. yup! xs was just the right size. i can't imagine anyone who wears m or s finding this dress fit flattering. it would look like a sack. it is an inch or two too short in the front for me  so i'll be returning it."
-1,"This top is really beautiful  but looks absolutely horrible on my 5'9"" apple shaped body. in the words of my husband  i looked like a star trek villain."
0,This looks great on the model and is probably beat suited for someone that is tall and thin with small hips.
0,Very cute and high-quality dress but it is very short. the length wouldn't be that much of an issue except for the fringe (which is awesome and unique  by the way) hits right at the butt. wish this dress (and  subsequently the fringe) was 3 inches longer.
0,I liked the concept of this vest  but when i tried it on  i felt like i was 9 years old again and wearing my brownies girl scout uniform. it was also very boxy and wide. it seemed to be well-made  though  and maybe would have worked if it were a different color.
1,"I ordered a size 4  my usual size in tops is s or xs for looser fitted tops  i prefer a more fitted look. for reference i am 5'4"" 120 lbs   32d. i ordered in pink and the color matches the online image. the pink is shear and i do have to wear a camisole underneath  which does not bother me at all. the top is adorable with jeans or slacks for work."
0,I ordered this in black and red. i had high hopes based on the reviews this received  but it's just ok. i will be returning.
1,"I am petite and curvy and was apprehensive about the cropped length of this jumpsuit. however  the petite looks great and the length is perfect. it is light enough weight to keep you cool during the day but provides some coverage for cool evenings. i ordered the xs petite and it was still a little loose. i am 5'3"" and 125lbs. this will be my go to for fall! looks great styled with ankle boots or clogs and will carry me into fall with a chunky sweater!"
-1,Disappointing  back is yellowish and looks strange. the front view is cute but doesn't match the fabric on the back at all. can't imagine why you would do that?
-1,Beautiful print  however as the previous reviewer mentioned it is very sheer  much sheerer than the product shot shows. i was expecting to be able to wear a nude bra under this without a cami  however my nude bra was completely visible.  the top also ended at the middle of the zipper of my jeans  so much shorter than the tunic length shown  and the bottom half of the sleeves ballooned out much more noticeably in person (the top half of the sleeves are slim  and the bottom half are looser).  over
0,"I am 5' 7"" with an athletic build (small chest  small waist  muscular hips/thighs). this shirt just hangs on me and makes me look much larger than i am. i purchased a small  an extra small would be way too short. i could see how it works for fuller figured girls."
1,Cute to wear with leggings. i like that it's easy to just throw on. it's fitted at the top and easy to chase kids around but doesn't look too momish or sloppy.
0,The outer layer runs large up top; also  the orange stitching (the flowers) on the outer layer are extremely bright orange rather then a fall brownish orange that would match the layer underneath. i'm returning it because for the price i don't love it.
-1,What a disappointment and for the price  it's outrageous!
1,I love this slip.. i am contemplating whether i can pass it off as a dress over the summer. the skirt is a subtle shinier grey than the top. it is flattering with or without a bra and i am not usually the type to go without. i am 5'3  32c and the xs fits perfectly! also i think it looks better in person.
1,I love this skirt  wanted to order it from the moment it was new and took em a while to decide to do so (when i saw it was almost sold out in my size  which it is now). another thing is it doesn't come in petite - boohoo.  anyway  ordered the 0 (smallest size) for my 26.5 in waist - didn't have any trouble with the waist being too tight  like some other reviewers. it fit really well and comfortably. sits at the natural waist  so the hem isn't too crazy low on me. fine for heels (would be so cute
-1,Just wanted to review so people know this hoodie has a zipper. it's very soft and comfy but i was looking for a pullover hoodie and am disappointed that once again retailer's picture doesn't match the actual product. it does fit true to size however.
0,I was so excited to receive this shirt. it is a beautiful color and material and very well made. i loved the lace detail and wanted to love the shirt. however  i put it on and the seem hit right at the top of my bust. it broadened my shoulders and the fabric started right at my bust so it flowed down from there making me look boxy and wide. i am a 32dd  5'3  and 115 pounds for reference. if you are more narrow and don't have a chest this would be absolutely adorable but sadly for me it had to go
1,"I ordered the red in size m. for reference i am 5'8"" with a long-ish torso. i would have been comfortable wearing the sweater with mid or high-rise jeans but it's fairly short. color was gorgeous. the balloon sleeves and seams just seemed too 1980s in a bad way on me. those with small chests may have better luck. i left like a suburban mom in it."
-1,I keep trying to find a peplum that works for me  but so far i have been unsuccessful. i just do not think that my shape and the peplum shape play well together?aside from the peplum issue  this shirt had a massive amount of material and runs large. the material alone is thick  making it a bulkier shirt  then add the volume of the peplum and i looked (and felt) huge. needless to say  this one was returned  sale or no sale.
-1,I recently bought this dress and wore it once. i really liked it! it was comfy  cute and fit well. but... then i washed it. i followed the washing instructions exactly  but now it looks more like a shirt than a dress and it's completely unwearable. i'm super disappointed because i thought this dress would be a wardrobe staple this summer.
1,This dress is easy to wear  lined and feels like it could be a wonderful summer staple. i love that it's so colorful. but for some reason  the pops of color on the white background did not look great on my very pale skin. i'm sure on someone else this will be beautiful. i also thought it ran just slightly large in the bust (although  to be fair  i am small-chested).
-1,I ordered this because the reviews were outstanding. i am returning it. although the embroidery looks fine on screen  in person it looks cheap and tacky. moreover  the high ruffled neck goes a step too far -- into over-the-top victorian cutesy.  overpriced  to boot.  obviously  mine is a minority opinion.
-1,This is much prettier online than on me. too much dress  even though i sized down.
1,I have thicker thighs and don't usually find that i can wear this kind of thing. these  on the other hand  are hot  hot  hot and are even somehow slimming for my thighs. i just adore them. i'm waiting for the green color to go on sale so i can buy them too!
0,The blue was a great color and i like the idea of a reversible top. however the xs was just swimming on me. this looks much more fitted in the pictures. my favorite workout top is from this brand and it is fitted and held up for 6 months. where are the fitted tops?? i'll keep looking.
0,I love the color blocking but dress hangs a little strange on me. love the pockets  thought about sending it back and decided it is very comfortable  i will wear it but not quite what i was hoping for.
0,"This top had potential  but the cut is very boxy and not fitted at all like the front picture shows. the picture from the back is much more representative of what it looks like. i'm 5'7""  135lbs and normally wear either an xs or s and the xs in this was still huge and boxy  but very short with tight sleeves (i have small arms so hardly ever have an issue with tight sleeves). the small fit better as far as length and and sleeves  but still very boxy. the pattern and cutouts are very cute  but thi"
0,This top did not look at all like it did on the model. i thought it would be slightly loose through the hips but instead it was snug on top and very very very loose. great for someone who is pregnant. which i am not.  returning.
1,I love this top and it's so pretty in person.  knew it would be full but was hoping it wouldn't be too big.  it's perfect and looks good with jeans.
0,I have been a big fan of this canadian designer so when i saw the sweater on the web  i immediately ordered it. on the website  it looks very modern and edgy chic. i was heartbroken when i saw it in person. when i opened the bag and put on the sweater  i noticed a lot of little black marks on the bathroom floor. it came from the sweater. size small was swimming on me and the holes on the shoulders  which supposed to look modern...well  the thin cheap material the sweater looks like it's ripped.
-1,This blouse is stunning on the website ;however  it is totally sheer which you cannot tell from the photo. i was very disappointed and will be returning.
1,The shirt is a little roomy but so flattering. the design with little see through holes across the shirt are unusual and make it unique.
-1,"The color is nice and the material is what you might find used by a high school drama club with a low budget - a very cheap polyester. on top of that - it is unhemmed and unfinished in any way - so you can bet  that about the second or third wearing there are going to be runs all through the thing. i've attached a picture of the ""hem"" below. on top of that - the ruching is awkward (as mentioned by another reviewers). all in all - kind of terrible."
-1,"I so wanted to love this top. i ordered the ""blue""  which is blue and orange. i thought the orange would be brighter  it is not. it is a dull color. also  i'm usually a medium  this top fits fine on my shoulders/bust 34c  but it was huge around the waist  making me look a lot larger. if this top were a bit smaller around the waist  i would keep it  but it is going back."
-1,First  it's huge. i'm not big busted but it's so roomy that i looked like i was pregnant. not exactly what i was going for. nice color and soft fabric but would only work if you plan to tuck it in--and i'm short waisted so no tucking for me. back it went.
-1,Saw this online and went in to try on. fit great and is true to size  but i should have known there would be issues as three out of six on the rack had the sewn in tags were all but hanging by a thread. i bought this for my bachelorette weekend in napa and when i put this on i noticed the straps had a few threads coming out and i thought  better get this to the seamstress as soon as i get home to secure the straps. well  literally five minutes into the car ride to the wineries i noticed the seam
1,I like these jeans. when i wore them  i received compliments. they do run large. i sized down one size  but probably could have sized down two sizes. they feel tight when you first put them on  but as you wear them  they loosen up and i find myself pulling them up to meet my waist. my other complaint is a small one. the embroidered flower on the knee rubs against your knee as you move. after awhile  my right knee felt like it had a carpet burn on it. that is why i gave this only 4 stars for desi
0,"This sweater caught my eye and the positive reviews and pre-holiday sale had me try it. loved the color and cut but surprisingly not the embroidery. i felt like i'd wear it a couple of times and then tire of it. my husband and daughter both said  ""meh "" so back it went."
0,Like others reviewers mentioned on here  this dress is extremely well made. but there were too many cons for me  as well. this would most certainly work on a petite/shorter frame  but for tall  busty  and curvier girls  it just sits wrong on all places unfortunately. the color is lovely along with the nice collar that ties in the back really made this dress stand out.  however  i'm a 36c and found that the arm/shoulder part so large and bulky that is made me look bigger on top. there was entirel
0,The geometrical pattern of this sweater is slightly asymmetrical  with nice geometry to it. the colors are more muted and subtle as compared to the picture. i was very excited to see it through its transparent bag. unfortunately my delight faded after i pulled the sweater out. first  it weighs a ton. a thread for each color runs around he whole sweater  hence much more thread went into it than in a typical sweater. second  it runs large. i am usually an xl or 16-18  but this sweater has lost of
1,Beautiful dress! excellent detail! loved everything about this dress except for the weight. this dress is very heavy which limits my wearing options in fl. given the fabric  this is a great special occasion dress.
1,This blouse is exactly what i wanted and the fit is great. silk is always light  and can go with jeans or dress up with a skirt. i'm wearing mine to a baby shower in a few weeks.
1,Fun versatile top for casual wear with capris  denim  or shorts/skirts. purchased both striped versions. love ballet necklines. the 3/4 length sleeve is wonderful for spring  summer  fall in california. the top is fitted yet it runs small. be sure to sized up. i normally wear xs  however this was way too tight. so i've ordered a small in both. hoping it works perfectly.
1,I love everything about this top! the fabric  the color  the fit! great top for spring and summer!
1,"I'm glad i red the reviews before ordering and sized down. for reference  i am 5'7"" and generally a size 8 or m in dresses. the small in this piece fits loosely in a flattering way  but a medium would have swallowed me. otherwise  it's a great  casual piece. the material is light and soft  and it's cute over leggings."
0,I love the pattern on this jacket and enjoy the bell shape. a fun jacket to through on and add quick style to a skinny pants.
1,I purchased the bright red color of this bandeau top. the color is vibrant and the overall style is very cute. unfortunately it made my chest look too big... but the quality is really nice and i'm sure it would look gorgeous on other body types.
1,Love this top! i have it in the green and i am tempted to go and buy it in the other colors! it is a simple  but cute top that is easy and comfortable to wear. a little dressier than a plain tee.
0,I followed the reviews and bought a larger size in the blue stripe. i am usually a size 8 but ordered a 12 (ok  maybe overkill). i usually have problems with sleeves being too tight  but this was way too big and tent like. i will be hopefully exchanging it in store for a smaller size. stay tuned for an update!
-1,I thought it was going to be so pretty. it is ugly on. the macrame is thick  stiff and rough. the top fits awkward on top where the macrame is and the rest is shapeless. yuk!
-1,The top was very small. i am usually a size small but this was tight around the top  arm holes and it was short. also i didn't notice if it said it was sheer ( see through) in the description but it definitely requires another shirt underneath.

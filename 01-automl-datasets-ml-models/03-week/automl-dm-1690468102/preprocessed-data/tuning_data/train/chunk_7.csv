0,Size up i was surprised that the fit was small i always seem to wear a 6 in retailer pencil skirts this was tight!
1,After seeing this top in the catalog i also spotted it in the retailer store. the peach color is even more perfect in person and compliments my skin tone perfectly. the style of the top is unique and flattering. now that i see even more colors  i'll need to buy more. my one reservation is that the material is super soft but very thin  so i hope it doesn't get holes - i want to wear this one all summer!
0,The fit was fine  but the fabric (the beige option) was bland. it washed me out. granted  i'm fair skinned  but it reminded me of sour milk. it's getting returned.
1,Beautiful dress but i had to returned because the size large was a little big
-1,This is a beautiful dress. the quality is excellent. the 3 layers and the embroidery are beautiful... however it just didn't look right on me. it looked like a maternity dress. i am very petite  short with a big bust and it just did nothing for me. i think this style would look best on a tall woman with a smaller bust. unfortunately i will be returning this dress.
0,It feels soft and like a good quality. however it really does run large and long. i was looking for a loose tank but this one was almost a tunic on my short height and even with a cardigan to give it a shape didn't work out. i also thought it would shrink in the dryer but it didn't. also wrinkles easily.
1,Great fit and dark color; thick yet very soft denim. only surprise for me was that the lacing is in the front (i was expecting it to be on the sides)  but i love them anyway!
0,This is a beautiful tunic. i wanted it to work so much but i couldn't get past the itch factor. also  the sleeves were shorter than i expected. when i wore a light tee underneath  it didn't move well and looked bulky so sadly it went back to the store. if the material doesn't bother you  buy this. would look great w/ tights/leggings and boots.
-1,"Like previous reviewers have said  these run a bit small and i'm surprised no one's mentioned that these are very high rise. for reference  i'm 5'7""  130 lbs  34-27-37  and am an retailer size 4 in tops and pants. i really wanted to love these pants  but even after ordering a size up and trying on a 6  i was still not in love. and the other reviewers are right ? the back zipper is kinda hard to zip up. the top of these pants are exactly the same as the essential flares  so if you're thinking of ge"
-1,This shirt was so weird?it does not fit like the photo at all. there seems to be missing a stitch or something at the top as it is wide open until the bottom/where it meets the other layer. i could wear a tank/camisole underneath  but it still just did not fit right. i do not have a large chest  but this was ridiculous. beyond that  the red color was just okay. even though i purchased this on sale  it was not worth the price and i returned.
1,"This dress is so flattering on  i was astounded. often the ""waistline"" in the petite dress are very high  even though i'm only 5'1"" tall  but this one hit at the right place and the skirt made me feel slim and tall. the fabric feels silky and the pattern is nice  but it is a pretty conservative style and perhaps a bit dark for spring. would be great for work  or church  but unfortunately doesn't really fit my lifestyle and i personally prefer a more unique style for the price. i highly recommend"
-1,I have never had a purchase go wrong at retailer  which is why i am was not hesitant to spend this much money on the blazer. however  the quality is very poor - it feels like it might fall apart after one clean. also  the buttons where not sewn on properly. i wear an xs and the size was a good fit  but the overall quality was not worth the price (or even close to it).
1,I purchased the gorgeous green color. i love that i can wear this with leggings and sandals in warm weather or boots and scarves when it's cooler outside. the best thing is that it has pockets to slip my phone in! the color is very flattering and i get lots of compliments when i wear it!
1,I'm wearing this top today at work and i feel very cute walking through the hallways. it's a little long in the back  because i'm short  but overall i enjoy wearing it. it's comfortable  casual  girly  and well made. i'm happy with it.
-1,This dress is great if you're very skinny and have no chest. otherwise  it makes you look dowdy. the colors are also quite washed out and do nothing for my complexion.    this one is going back.
0,I tried this on in the store in the xs size. the pattern is striking and really makes you think of all the things you love about fall. having said that i did not buy it and probably won't unless i find it on the sale rack later. it is really more of a poncho than a sweater. the fit is very oversize through the body and i tried the xs size. it is also fairly cropped on me as i am tall. i would only wear it with a shirt underneath. the sleeves and not attached to the shoulder  but start further do
0,Too pricey for the quality of this imported product.
-1,Disappointed  the cut of the layer makes anyone wearing it look pregnant. even the model in the picture the way that layer hangs.
1,Cozy  soft fabric.  love the snails on the pockets and the cute buttons.  size down if you want a more tailored fit.
-1,This looks so gorgeous on the model on the site  so i ordered it online. it was incredibly frumpy when i tried it on. looks like i took a floor rug  cut a hole in the middle and slipped it over my head. the sweater itself is so pretty  its just too bad it falls so awkwardly on me. i normally wear a small so i ordered the xs/s and the sleeves still fall past my thumbs. its kind of itchy too. will be returning this asap.
-1,My conscience screamed at me not to buy this sweater and i wish i had listened! i noted the fact that it was acrylic and also the fact that it was oversized. but i also loved the design and can't resist anything with mustard yellow. i was instantly disappointed when i received it  almost didn't even try it on. how can they possibly charge $185 for terrible itchy 80's acrylic? it looks cheap  it feels cheap and it didn't even fit well. only redeeming quality: easily returnable!
0,"I think these are amazing for anyone over  say  5'5"". the way these hung on me (at 5'2"") were very unflattering in the front. they had an unfortunate masculine effect to them. that's all i can say without being crass."
0,"Got this for my daughter for christmas. she loves the ""boho peasant"" look. i thought the fabric would be white or at least cream color but it was closer to pale yellow. although the fabric quality and texture is lovely (more substantive than i expected)   she just couldn't like the top with the color being so off. disappointing as picture makes it much prettier."
0,I really wanted this skirt to work but it didn't look very flattering on me. a great midi length and very cool pattern  so hopefully will work for others!
1,The design on this dress is so cute. it runs really small. i had to go up from my normal size 4 to a 6. i am not well endowed so the top was great on me. it's looks great on once k got a size that works.
0,I am pretty standard size 8  36c  5&amp;#39;6&amp;quot;  150 lbs. i ordered the small and the bust fit well but the whole thing was like a tent and way too flowy for my taste. it was also long so everything was very covered. i didn&amp;#39;t feel it flattered my build. i returned!
0,Runs very big.  i ordered a l and need a m.  unfortunately no medium left!  great top with lots of character. hate i missed this cute top
-1,I loved the style of this shirt so much that i bought two of them. unfortunately after washing the turquoise one  it sprang several holes. the same thing happened to the second one after one wash! i purchased several of these shirts in the tank style over this past summer  and they have washed and worn great. i think the fabric quality and craftsmanship has gone way downhill at retailer lately. very disappointed.
-1,Unless you have the body of the model - tall and very thin and wear a really small size - don't even think about getting this dress! it's literally a heavy sack. it hit right above my knee in the front and basically mid-calf in the back. the material is nice but it's an awful shape!
0,Love the detail of the white with yellow underneath but agree with the other reviewer that the material is very thin in the back. also  it is a flowly top so you will need to size down. however  because of the shape it will fit snuggly around the chest/arms. this didn't work for me as it accentuated my normal body type (as in not the model type). i am not overweight but it definitely didn't flatter my chest area. seems like the top worked for others so i suggest trying on first.
1,I just received this in the mail and must say its one of my favorite purchases in a long time from retailer. the navy polka dot color combo is classic yet fun with the orange. looks great on its own as well as under a cardy. this will be in heavy rotation.
0,...the print is so sharking  and i love the way it looks on the model -- but i'm a more curvy figure  and the boxy-ish cut plus rather stuff fabric in front is incredibly unflattering. ordinarily i love everything made by maeve  but this one sadly must be returned... on a thinner/straighter-shaped person i expect it would be great.
-1,I wore this for the first time today  and after just about an hour  it gently nicked something and got a hole in the pack.  its so disappointing as i love they style and its so comfortable. very poor quality for the price :(
1,Received this jacket today and i am so very impressed with the details. initially when i ordered this jacket i first thought the navy blue waffle fabric was a corduroy or velvet  but it is a plain cotton blended fabric with unfinished edges that has the denim attached to it. the plus is the inside breast pocket that is trimmed so nicely and lined  and fits a nice sized phone. the inside is lined and even the sleeves are lined . there is pretty cream lace trim on the inside bottom of the lining i
1,I purchased this dress for my 31st birthday and i am so glad that i did! i saw it in my local retailer store and immediately had to try it on! it is very flattering because i am 5'0  usually a size 8 or 10 in dresses and it fit perfect! the material is light  definitely suggest delicate cycle and hang-drying  but it is nice because you can layer this dress with a vest or coat! highly recommend this dress!
-1,This cardi is cuter in the stock photos. in person  the colors are a bit more drab. stock photos also don't show quite how much of a swing shape this has. it is very soft  though. returned it!
-1,I want to like this top because the idea is cute but i ordered the small and it might have well been xxxl.  with sizing like this  one size fits all could just about do it.
1,Love love love this dress.  fits like a glove. beautiful details. amazing quality. i'm so happy with this dress and know i'll have it for years. :)
-1,Agree with other poster. this shirt runs very big. i'm all for a flowy  shirt that hides my belly but this is just a tent. i'll be retuning it.
-1,I wanted this tank to work so badly! it was a great deal and so beautiful. unfortunately the top fitted portion ends right below my chest then the shirt flares out so i looked like a cupcake. my belly also showed slightly because the shirt is short. if you have a short torso  this would work great. if not  unfortunately  its not great - tear
1,Love everything about these pants. a little sheer  but super beautiful and comfortable.
-1,I adore the feel and cut of these culottes  but the quality has diminished my faith in retailer. picks  piles  and serious wear and tear after just one day. i feel as if i wasted my money.
-1,Granted that i am not as reed thin  or as young  as the model. but i am tall and reasonably slender. i have long hands and small wrists  which would be a factor in the overall effect of this garment. this poncho looked like some sad old stretched out who-knows-what that you'd keep in the car for emergency purposes  in case you needed warmth if the car broke down in a snowstorm -- and i have one of those foldable reflective blankets in the glove box for that purpose. i was looking for a statement
1,Like the other reviewers said  it has a lot of bulky fabric if you wear it as pictured. i tried it on and tied the string around the back so it's an open vest. i love if!
0,Very well made  wonderful fabric. fit perfectly everywhere but the bust.
0,Very cute adorable shape tank top but extremely huge    does not come in petite and is not even close to fitting me    extra small is like a medium    not a sky color   like the picture it is a black-and-white type of the shirt which needs a thin camisole underneath  shirt is definitely white but would look great with the black or gray camisole underneath    better for taller larger sized people
0,I have bought other leggings at retailer and they were fine. these run small. i have to return.
0,O.k. i soo wanted to love this dress. if you are slim and small chested it is true to size and lovely. i am slim and tall 5'9 but am large chested. a 36d i usually wear an 8/10 so bought a 10. it was too tight around my chest and back. so i went up a size to a 12. it was better but not exactly comfortable. i could get away with it but for the price had to send it back. the idea of going up another size yet again was a thought but i worried it wouldn't solve my issue.
1,I am tall and this sweater is a great length. very flattering  slightly loose across the tummy. i have the red/mauve color and may order the gray too. super soft   medium weight sweater- very versatile. love
0,I loved the shape of this sweater. the way it draped from the waist was flattering and different. the sleeves were a strange length  however  between long and 3/4 length which made it look like they the sweater was just too short for me. the color looked peachy or pink in the photo  but in reality  it was almost skin tone  which was not flattering with my olive coloring. paler women might find it attractive. the real downside for me was the fabric which was thin with the flowers mainly printed o
-1,This dress was so pretty on the hanger but a saggy sack on. even the sz 0 was too loose and shapeless. there is no waist as pictured. the hi-low hem  loose fit and wavy waist seam (see in the third close-up picture) make it look like the dress shrunk oddly in the wash. it's really too bad  it's such a pretty combination of patterns.
1,I got this dress to wear for christmas and it is perfect. looks great and is very comfy. low cut in front and back that is not too revealing and allows for perfect bra coverages. i got it in a small small.
-1,Super cute but the fabric was so thin & flimsy i was afraid it would fall apart once it was washed so returned it.
-1,This pants the worst short that i ever had!!  i bought ;this short last week and i laundry it yesterday and it came out lost color!!  i was really shock definetly will return it to store.  fyi  i never use chrolox or bleach when i laundry.
-1,Remember those cable-knot cotton sweaters that were popular in the eighties?! that's exactly what this sweater is. everywhere your body bends like elbows is emphasized by the fact that cotton does not bounce back like other finer fabrics like wool and cashmere. i'll pass on this!
-1,"I bought these last year and loved them  however they came in tall sizes. this year they do not and the inseam is just way too short  even at 33"". im 5'7"" and  they barely graze the floor with no break in the pant leg. i prefer to wear them with boots and they will not be long enough even with a short heal"
1,I purchased the teal/blue and the color is striking. though i put true to size the decorative top is slightly tight around the bust. and the bottom too is fitted and not flowy. for a looser fit you may want to size up. for a more fitted look it is true to size.
0,"Cute pants  not for me. a petite size may have changed my mind. more like ankle pants on my 5'2"" frame and a bit large all over. that said  the fabric is stretchy and they would be super comfortable. love the snaps on the waistband  classy casual."
0,I knew there was a problem when my dress arrived and the small fit perfectly when i was 9 months pregnant...i even bought a small even though i normally wear medium i bought it for family pictures once my daughter was born but it made me look like i was still pregnant even though i had already lost all the baby weight in 3 weeks. it is a beautiful dress though and may try to get it altered to see if that works
0,Saw this tunic on line and when it was immediately sold out i thought it had to be a winner. after several days of trolling on line the 2p was finally back in stock. now comes the disappointment. yes  the material is sheer but would be a nice weight for humid summer days. the front looked exactly like the model. cut with high side slits that truly made this a tunic. the back of this tunic is some sort of origami design. the fabric bunches out at the butt area. it's bad when you're standing and i
1,I like dresses with sleeves as those are more appropriate for work for me. this dress is a smooth material and the asymmetrical bottom adds just a little extra something. i got it in my normal size and i do find it looser/not meant to be body hugging again making it work appropriate.
1,Casual  pretty. runs a little large  especially through the waist  but a great comfortable shirt.
1,"I am not really a ""print person"" but cartonnier gets it right every time - modern prints that lend themselves to many styling and paring options. the charlie trouser  which they do every season  is a great fitting pant (going up a size is a must as they do run small) with details (stitching  buttons  pockets) that make their pants look more expensive than they actually are. i bought these in the blue combo when i saw them at my local retailer store. the blue combo has both blue and black (as well"
1,I fell in love with this piece the moment i saw it. unfort they were out of the s  so i went with a medium. fortunately for me  this piece runs true to size and so while slightly large  i will still keep it. the material is sturdy and of good quality  the buttons are large and noticeable and the ties by the shoulder are not flimsy. great piece!
0,I was really looking forward to getting this top but what a disappointment. it is absolutely huge! i normally wear a large and i think a small would have fit me and a small never fits me. too bad cause it's such a pretty top. p.s. this has an attached camis (which i hate).
1,These pants are perfect for crisp fall weather and comfortable! i wear them with flats to dress down or heels to dress up! recommended for all shapes!
1,While i have to agree with some other reviewers that this is not the most flattering coat (as a size 12/14 with hips  it does my hips no favors)  but the comfort and warmth make up for it. this coat is so soft  it's like wearing a puffy blanket. unlike typical puffer coats  it does not have any kind of vinyl feel to it- but nor does it have any wind or water resistance at all. with all that said  the comfort and cosy feel won me over. i've received several compliments as well  so maybe it's more
1,Love this dress and the color
0,So this is still a pretty cute shirt  but my xs is missing the ruffle in the front and has layers on the bottom front of shirt. it doesn't seem to be defective  just a different version of the shirt. i'm curious to find out from others if they have gotten the same shirt as i have. still deciding whether to keep or not. no more left in xs to place another order and see what's up. i do wish it had the ruffle in front  as that is what caught my eye.
-1,"Dress is nice but can't be worn without tights or you are at a risk of indecently exposing yourself. it is around 30"" in length so is more of a tunic than a dress. i'm only 5'1 and it was too short . can't imagine anyone taller even trying to wear this !"
-1,"1. i'm 5'6"" tall with a short waist and long legs  and this skirt came all the way down to my ankles. i would have kept it if it had stopped mid-calf like in the photo.  2. i'm 38-32-40 and the size 12 fit me perfectly in the waist hip area  so i would say it runs true to size.  3. the buttons lay nice and flat over the tummy  so that's a plus. at least you don't have to undo them to go to the bathroom."

1,"The first time i saw this in the store i passed it by because the fabric didn't appeal to me .... but the second time i tried it on and fell in love .... had to have it in the beautiful blue.  i'm busty 32h but wear a small and the gathers do wonders to camouflage  which was a nice surprise  because i usually avoid anything with fullness.  will look great with white or black jeans but i will also pair with a very subtle pattern legging as the length is perfect.  i'm short  5'3"".  neckline is fem"
-1,The material that was used to make this top is very thin and poor quality. it feels like the type of material that will disintegrate after one wash. i normally wear an xl and this top is huge and not flattering. returning asap.
0,Bought this dress without trying it on but listened to the previous reviews saying this ran small and wow does it. i usually wear a 6 but ordered an eight which was hard to get on even with the upsizing. i do have a 34ddd bust so i do have a difficult time when dresses have no stretch over give in that area. overall beautiful dress  fabric is not stretchy which killed it for me.
1,I love the way these pants feel on. they are so comfortable and breezy. i love that i can feel cool in the summer without showing a lot of skin. i purchased both colors; both are very nice looking. that said  i'm not sure if i will keep them. they wrinkle something terrible. i'm pretty casual person and it even bothers me. it probably wouldn't be so bad if there weren't pleats in the front. after sitting for just a few minutes the pants look like a disaster in front. my husband said it's not ext
1,"I liked this top a lot when i saw it at the store - the cotton is soft and comfortable  the colors are good (i tried on the white  charcoal  and light aqua blue)  and the asymmetrical edge really makes it. the subtle ruffle detail at the edge combined with the pieced asymmetrical hem takes it from a classic tee to a contemporary style. however  my store doesn't have petite sizes  and the regular size hit me at a point in the hip that wasn't super-flattering on me (at 5'1""). it imay be an excelle"
-1,"This sweater was huge  it hung down to my calves! it also is really bulky and scratchy  it feels as if you are wearing an old wool blanket. i think it is only made for really tall and skinny people. i'm 5'2"" and weigh 120lbs. and i ordered a size s  and i was swimming in it. the fabric is very thick  i may be great if you live in alaska or the arctic. it adds about 20lbs to your body frame......."
-1,The reason for the title above is this skirt doesn't wow me. i felt like i could find this anywhere  and i don't go to retailer for such things. they have definitely mainstreamed more and more over the years....  __________  pros:  - tts. i tried on a large (and i'm normally either a 10 or 12) and it fit well and hung well on my hourglass and wider hips without billowing out.  - flows nicely! it does have a great movement to it.  - a good everyday skirt.  - not sheer at all. it is lined.  - when y
1,Lightweight and cute. these pants do run on the larger side  which is fine is you like a more relaxed look. i usually wear a 10-12 in pants and i had to exchange the large for a medium which fit much better. great for summer weather!
1,I love this top. i purchased it in an xs and feels it is tts. it can be dressed up or down. i recently paired this with the cloth and stone chambray drawstring shorts and it was the perfect summer outfit. the button details in the back are such a nice touch. i got many compliments on this top.
-1,When i saw this blouse online i thought it looked like a great combination of casual with the elegance of an intricate print. i was so disappointed when it came. the print is not centered in the front or the back. it looks like they were trying to save on the material and just cut it out wherever with no thought to symmetry. for this price the detail of centering the design was expected  especially because this is how it appeared in the picture. loved the blouse  but i will be returning it becau
0,Cute skort but seems to run big. it's also sort of long for shorts (the model must have much longer legs than me). i may try a size smaller since i love the print but i'm not optimistic.
-1,I ordered the orange in size xl. the fit on me matches the model other than being a little shorter in length.  the quality is bad. i ordered two of these sweaters and both arrived  new in the packages  with one having a small hole. the knit is so thin  as is the base material. the arms are basically see-through. it doesn't offer any warmth because of the thinness. i layered a long-sleeved white tee underneath which helped. the edge of the sleeves stretched out within an hour. i also had two area
0,This is  like many reviewers stated  a very flattering and nice dress. the sleeves were particularly great  because they are slightly longer than most of this type and went past the meaty (for lack of a better word!) part of my arm  only exposing the slimmer bits. it looked great on me  and i imagine it would on most people. i just did not like the handkerchief hem....too young  too trendy? i don't know  when you're in your 40s  you start to feel ridiculous in certain styles! i just didn't feel
1,I tried these on at the store and the fit was good  the length was even ok for me as a petite person. the fabric was substantial and mostly cotton  which i like. but i felt like the floral pattern drew too much attention to my thighs  so it wasn't ultimately something i felt i would wear. still a nice comfort piece if you are ok with a floral pattern on your lower half.
0,While this top has a lovely design  neckline and color the metalic threads made it too shimmery for me. i actually think it looks better in pictures than in person because of the metallic threads.
1,Love this sweater for so many reasons; fits true to size  unique in design  versatile  soft and so easy to wear. i've worn it tied in the back and front. it goes great with a skirt or dress pants for work  date night and elevates the look with any of my jeans. i love haying clothes i can get the most out of. highly recommend this sweater!
0,I  absolutely fell in love with the stress when i sought in the store. the fabric and drape of the fabric is amazing! however  it runs extremely small. i normally wear a medium and can sometimes even wear a small and dresses. i tried on the medium and the large and i could not even get them zipped all the way.  i'm so disappointed  as this is a gorgeous dress.  definitely size up at least one  maybe two sizes.
1,I've been searching for a brown top/dress/tunic forever and i finally found the perfect one!! i stumbled across this adorable tunic while browsing the clearance room at my local retailer and you can imagine my excitement when it was my size (small). i tried it on and almost asked to wear it out of the store. it's sooo soft and has a beautiful rib-like pattern/texture to it. you could wear it as a top with pants or a dress with tights/leggings.
0,After losing a lot of weight i thought i'd try a pair of skinny jeans and since pilcro is my favorite jeans brand  i bought my usual pilcro size but wow. these are just way too tight. they pull on like leggings or tights  clinging to every part of your leg - there isn't even a bit of looseness around the calves and my lower legs have never been big. i kept thinking i'd just lose more weight and they would fit better but that isn't happening either (the fit) so these are going to my daughter who
1,I love this top so much! the fit is super flattering and forgiving in the tummy area-win.
1,If i hadn't seen the description online  i would never have known these pants were navy!   i bought them today and tried them on with a black tunic which looked fantastic. the style is very similar to cartonnier slim pant but the fabric is lighter weight and stretchier.  since i'm heavy around the stomach  i will wear the pant with a long tunic top (to avoid the drumstick look) which is a shame since the pockets are so cute. the colors in the pants mean that you can match and contrast with a wid
1,In love with this. as soon as i received it in the mail i ordered another color. super soft and easy to wear. i imagine i will live in this top the rest of the summer. felt pricey  but worth it for as much wear as i will get out of it. i am 5'10  160 and the large is a great fit. perfect fit on the shoulders and just a hair loose throughout the rest of the tank  which is what i wanted.
0,I don't know if i was sent a petite by mistake  but this is not 39 inches long. i realize it says swing dress  but i thought if the length was accurate and the fabric heavy enough  the weight would make it flattering on me. as it was in reality--short and light-weight fabric--it poofed out in an unattractive way. too bad  as the print is lovely.
-1,"I just received this in the mail today. first of all there was no slip included and the fabric is totally sheer. the description says ""viscose lining"" so i assume there was a slip and from the picture it looks like it was a beige color. second of all  it was obviously sent from a store where they lost the slip and it was squished into the smallest possible retailer envelope. the fabric is beautiful but the dress is humongous like the previous reviewers said. i ordered a size smaller than us"
-1,I didn't think top was very flattering and  while in the picture the mismatched hem lines in the collar looked cute in person it just looks odd. this is especially true of the back of the sort where the mismatched hem repeats at the bottom...just looks mis-sewn instead of purposeful. sadly this one is going back to the store.
-1,It was huge. material looked good but was too bulky. will be returning it.
1,From the online pics  i would never think to try this on  but i was looking for a shirtdress with pockets  so glad i did! i purchased in green and navy... i love the neck line when buttoned up  almost military jacket'ish and i like the idea of wearing over jeans and a shirt and leaving unbuttoned almost like a light layer or jacket. super soft material... i purchased a size 6 and i am 5'9 and 140 lbs.
1,This is a beautiful  well made jacket. also  it's very cozy and warm. unfortunately for me  it was too short and wide. i ordered the petite  but it was still too wide which also made it look too short. not flattering for my small frame.
0,I thought i'd like this dress in the neutral color. i had to return it it as it was quite unflattering. the skirt made my hips look big and the uneven shape didn't help. the top fit well  in my usual 4 petite  i think it would look nice on some people  as it's something different but i am not one of those it worked on.
0,I ordered a m as the previous review said it ran small. i found it to be very large. i have more curves than the model and also thought it made me look boxy.
0,I saw these in my local retailer and loved them on the hanger. when i tried them on  not so much. the material is a pretty substantial white denim and very stretchy (i didn't find them to be that smooth of a fabric  but more of a traditional denim texture). i am a 6-8 in pants  and normally wear a 27 in pilcro denim. when i tried on the size 27 in the store  i found them to be very tight in the thighs - and i don't have big thighs. i also found the pants to pull conspicuously across the crotch are
-1,I was disappointed in this shirt. the color was not the pretty blue pictured  but rather a grayish blue which may look good on a brunette  but not on a blonde. the fabric felt like linen and wrinkled easily. normally  the quality of the fabric is one of my main reasons to buy holding horses  but this one felt cheap. the detail and craftsmanship was beautiful  and i wish this shirt would have worked for me. i waited for it to go on sale and was very excited to receive it. holding horses is one of
-1,I was very excited about this product. when i saw it the pattern was beautiful in the romantic floral and the bottom band looked like the bathing suit was a little longer so i felt it would be good for a large chest. when i received the package i knew instantly it ran small. i tried it on and it barely covered half of my chest. also the band at the bottom is actually very small and not what i expected. the print is just as lovely in person as it is online. i don't even know if sizing up will mak
1,"Call my corny but this dress inspires me to run barefoot through the lavender fields in provence.  the flowy layers and dreamy prints are mesmerizing.  fit is ideal for my body type as long as you size down.  i had no weird sagging  bagging or poofiness.  and i love the macrame belt!  i tied it offset to the side but the dress looks good unbelted too.  i purchased the small petite.     my stats for fit reference:  5'3"" tall  140#  36dd  28"" waist  35"" hips  wide rib cage  size m/l tops  size s/m"
0,"I've been searching for a pretty and unique ""party top"" and thought this was it. it is beautiful and unique but much too cropped for me and i'm only 5'3"". sadly i had to return. maybe would be more appropriate on someone younger"
1,I love this top. it's not just an average tee due to the asymmetry in the seams. it's super soft and comes in some great colors. i wish it was slightly longer on the sides but otherwise perfect tee!
-1,I wanted a comfortable and loose casual dress. i liked the pictures and decided to give it a try.  the dress turned out to be too loose (i got size 4 after checking the measurements chart  i'm 5'7' 125 lb and usually wear s). i could practically wrap myself in this dress. besides  it looks a bit too long (well  i'm not as tall as the model in the photos and i don't like wearing high heels).  the material looks faded  not as bright as in the pictures. i like distressed and vintage style  but this
-1,As soon as i pulled these pants from their packaging  i feel in love with them. the fabric was so soft - i could not wait to get them on...yeah  that was not going to happen! i could not pull them on - not even a little bit! these pants run incredibly small. i ordered them twice: once in my regular size  and again in a larger size. unfortunately  i am sized out of these beauties.
-1,I am 5 6' and 130 pounds and ordered this in an xs. the sweater is enormous. the material is also scratchy and not soft at all. i'm disappointed with retailer's sizing this year. i've had to return a # of xs items because they are huge. really disappointing.
-1,"I bought this dress in an xs  and am 5'4""  115 lbs  and fairly proportional. the shoulders were snug  but the hips (and maybe waist)were at least 2-3x too big. comically so-- the fabric stood away from my body like wings on each side."
0,I was really excited for this sweater  its not terrible but its not great. the sweater was large making me feel like a blob in it. it is warm and the fabric is pretty there was just no shape to it. i would try a different sweater.
1,Fit is true to size  color is accurate. love the feel of the knit  it's weightier than if anticipated. i'm looking forward to wearing this to my pnw trips.
0,I bought this top in lilac size s since other reviewers said it has a lot of fabric. the color and the quality were great -- loved that it had the lining underneath. if your bust is bigger than an a cup  beware. the top basically flared out from the farthest point on my bust and the fabric below just hung there. it was a pregnancy look. perhaps that's why the model has her arms crossed in front -- to give the illusion that it tapers in below the ribs  but it does not. unfortunately  this one is
0,"I am normally a m-l (170 lbs  5'4""  34dd). i ordered this top in a medium knowing it ran big  and it is huge. seriously  i could wear it as a dress. i like the whole loose and comfy top thing  but this is so massive it looks sloppy. i'm going try and return it for a small. hey  i like that i can wear a small! the green color really is pretty  and it's so soft. just need a much smaller size."
1,This is ruching done right! i tried this dress on and the two other women who saw me in it went to try it on as well.  it is fitted  but comfortable and because it is well cut the ruching hides a multitude of sins to leave you looking sleek and curvy in all the right places. it is also a versatile layering piece and would look great with almost anything. so unless this particular color is your nemesis  this dress is a winner!
0,The lower part of dress bunches where buttons are  so the dress doesn't look flushed from top to bottom. i ended up returning it.
0,I so wanted to love this top. i first ordered in the medium because previous reviews said it ran large. i got the medium and it ran so small in the arms that i could almost not get it off with ripping it. so i ordered an xl hoping that would work. unfortunately it ran just as small i'm the arms and i had to return.
0,The fabric   feel and design of this dress is sooo cute  but so large that sadly  it will need to go back. beautiful and softly flowing design but so full that not flattering.
-1,I was very excited to receive this dress because of the cute photo. however  upon arrival i was completely disappointed. the color is much more drab than the photo. the smudged polkadots weren't attractive. there were many little bumps and pulls in the linen. the dress is super heavy. the pleats around the waist did not lay correctly. and it adds 10 pounds to your hips! super sad! i am sending it back.
0,I ordered my usual size 8 but this run huge  i had to exchange for 6 or even size 4. the fabric is nice and airy. it seems to easily wrinkle though. just have to either iron everytime or dry clean i suppose. unique design.
-1,The fabric is soooo thick. the pattern is very spring/summer but the heavy thick and lined fabric says otherwise. the pockets are great and the fit was true to size but that fabric killed it for me
1,I was looking for a top to go with leggings that didn't look like a sack and this is perfect. the v-neck and unusual cut on the bottom makes it more interesting than a typical tunic and the fabric is so snuggly. love it.
0,I love the fabric of this dress and the way it fits  but it is too low for me i thought about putting a cami under it  but that would ruin the look of the dress. just an inch or so higher would have been much better. as much as i like the design and fit  i will be returning this dress.
-1,Very cute top but runs very very big ! im5 ft 5 in tall  120 lbs. i ordered the xs but it was so big it looked like a maternity top.. sadly returned the top. otherwise the top was made of good quality fabric.
-1,"Too thin at bottom where lace is.  couldn't sit in the dress without worrying i was ""hanging out"""
-1,This top is very cute and if you are short you will love it. i am tall and the dividing line of color block kept rising up over my bust so it looked weird. it made it look like an ill fitting maternity top. had to go back.
1,"Just received and sorry to return. i am 5'9"" i wear a size 8 i ordered the m/l . it way really big and to wide"
1,I'm normally an xl  but i bought a l since so many said it was big and boxy. the l fit great. it's tailored to the body  but not tight-fitting  just as shown on the model.    the detailing at the shoulders is heavy  compared to the light knit of the fabric of this tee. so  it pulls the neckline forward a bit.     i bought the red and wow! it's a bright  fireengine red that's just stunning. it looks lighter in the photo. it arrived all squished up in a little tiny roll so it was really wrinkled.
-1,Such a great dress. fit is flattering. the small v cut in the front and beading around the neckline keep it from becoming a boring lbd. classy enough to wear to a funeral but can be dressed up with some killer shoes. thrilled with purchase!
-1,"The design of this sweater is odd. it made me feel very ""round"" when i put it on. the sleeves were wide. the other reviewers were correct in saying that it's a thick sweater  which i thought i'd like. the torso was slimmer and longer than i expected. it really was the odd design of the sleeves that made me not like this sweater."
0,"I didn't end up keeping this dress...it just wasn't right for me. it is very cute and fit well but the fabric was very thin (partially lined which is a plus) and the hem line coming up on the sides made it just too short for me. i ordered the petite xs and liked the length in front and back well but the side slit/vent was just too high for my liking. the tie part hit at the perfect spot for me at only 5'4"" (~118#). i guess i just didn't ""love"" it and would rather save my funds for something i ca"
1,The print caught my eye. then i felt the breathable cotton fabric and had to try it on. i am only 5'2'' and have a small waist but sized 32dd bust with hips and have a hard time finding clothes that fit well.. this dress fit me perfectly! i have dressed it up and down and always get compliments. this dress was on the pricey side but has turned out to be worth every penny.
1,"The navy version of these pants are beautiful. the contrast gray stripe is subtle and slimming  and continues through details in the pockets.    i am 5'6""  34-26-38 and i wore a size 4 regular and 4 petite. the regulars were very long  and even heels couldn't help them. the pant leg covered my foot  covered my toes. the petites were much better (and i rarely order petite). they hit the bottom of my foot with no heels  so i think a heel would make them look right. i'm just not sure if the petite"
0,This is a gorgeous dress. i got the red version. it's stunning...the zipper is trash however. i'm scared of getting stuck in it like another reviewer.
0,"I'm 5'2""  weigh 120 lb.. i ordered p6 and found the torso too short. if i bent forward or kneeled down that fabric would ride ride up into my butt big time. the top was a little loose too. i'm 35ab cup. i love the colors and geometric design. sadly i have to return."
0,This is a beautiful beaded shirt. the quality seems good. i just didn't like the shoulders. they are pleated and puffy. the picture doesn't really show them very well. also the collar is a little floppy. i was hoping it would have an option to stand up but that is not the case. the beading is well done and looks to be stable. i just thought it ran a little large and the shoulders looked puffy. i returned it.
-1,The print on these leggings is so cool but they are completely see-through. i mean seriously  seriously see-through.
0,When i tried it on it looked like a stiff bathrobe. straight  too boxy.
-1,I had high hopes for this tunic for an upcoming ny trip - to look stylish and beat the heat. it is huge. the tunic swallowed my whole. it came down nearly to my knees (i'm 5' 6) and it was gigantic - shapeless and did not look stylish at all. on the model it looks like it hits mid-thigh. i am a size 10 - and the l was like a giant trash bag on me. if i had time  i would try the medium ...
1,Love this dress. great lightweight fabric  bold colors  and lined to the knee. the lining makes sure the dress lies smooth  but it breaths well so it doesn't add extra heat. i found it ran true to size and it's a good length for tall girls. i like that you can tie the belt in the front or back. looks great on it's own or dress it up with a statement necklace. there is also a nice girth to the skirt giving it lots of movement. great find.
-1,I really loved the idea of this dress and thought it may be perfect for work with a pair of wedges. but  the first thing that set me off was the color and the material. the color is more street sign yellow than a soft  warm yellow. the fabric is a thin  sheet like fabric that makes the yellow look even cheaper. i was anticipating a thicker shirt-like fabric. when i tried it on  i liked the idea  but the material and the color made me feel like i was wearing costume...or a parachute. i will defin

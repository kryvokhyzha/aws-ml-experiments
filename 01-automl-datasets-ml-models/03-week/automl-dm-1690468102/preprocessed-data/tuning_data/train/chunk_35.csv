1,I rarely buy anything at full price at retailer. but  after trying this dress on last weekend i had to buy it because i couldn't handle the thought of not having this dress in my life! i'm 5 feet tall and a size 12  so this was definitely a maxi on me. but  there is just enough room at the bottom that i can safely wear it with flats. i'm very pear-shaped and this dress is extremely flattering on me. even my husband agreed that i needed to buy it even though he hates my shopping/clothing add
1,"Just tried 'layered sadie top' and it felt so nice on. good hand feel for both materials but note that the knit on top is a little too delicate for machine wash but can be hand washed. this item is definitely ""vanity-sized"". i'm 5'1  113lbs and the xs looked nothing like how it does on the model. it was flowy as depicted but it came down much lower on me and looked a little maternity-esque. highly recommend because it's gorgeous and well made but i would definitely come in and try it out for you"
0,"This top is beautiful in the model shot  but average in person. it ran really small  i usually take a medium in retailer tops and ordered this in a medium. it barely fit over my chest  and was pretty short (i am 5'7""). also  the material is very thin  not so much that you can see your undergarment  but if you get cold everyone will know it. also  for the price  i expected a sturdier fabric. i would recommend holding out for sale  if you are interested in this top."
-1,This top runs super small in the upper arms  shoulder area..could not even stretch out my arms! ...other then that major problem  the length and body fit were perfect...i am true med and/or large in all retailer tops so i tried sizes 10  12 and neither worked for me due to arm/shoulder fit...disappointed because it really is a beautiful top...
-1,"I love this t-shirt because it has the combination of elegance and relazation to a ""t"".  it's soft  pretty and covers my wide bottom well."
-1,This really was nothing special. for $68 there are much cuter tops at retailer. it wasn't particularly flattering as it was very boxy  so it added volume. it was soft and felt like decent quality which was nice. i agree with another reviewer that the ruffles feel too big. overall  this was just a miss for me.
0,I saw this dress in the store months ago and never forgot it  so when i saw it on sale i nabbed it online. so sad to see how this dress fits: just right up top  just right along the hem  and then it's a hot  potato-sack-frump mess in the middle. it's a shame because the fabric is beautiful.
-1,"Oh  i wanted this dress to work! i bought it in green  red and the solid blue. all ran really small. i *just* fit in a 10  when i would normally take a 6 in retailer sizes (5'8"" and 140 lbs). as with many other reviewers  i also noticed that the zipper was a huge flaw. it took a long  slow motion to get it zipped because it would get stuck on the fabric variations. such a cute style  was really bummed it didn't work. i kept ordering it in other colors thinking i would hit the jackpot  but they wer"
0,I usually wear a small  4 or 6 and in this dress i couldn't even zip up the 8. so tight in the rib cage and chest. if i tried to go up even further the bottom half got much bigger. guess this one is not for me.
1,Simply lovely to look at because of the fringe detail and it's a joy to wear because it does not cling to my trouble spots.  very versatile as it can be worn and layered in many different ways.  i was lucky enough to buy this in petite but i'm sure the regular would've been fine.  looking forward to outfitting this because i got so much inspiration from instagram.
0,"Ordered this in xl- i usually am between l and xl. i'm 5'9"" and thought it was cropped  boxy  and billowy around the midsection that was not flattering. the fabric is light and is less like a blazer  more like a cardigan."
0,The cut and print of this dress is beautiful. however  the armhole is way too low  which is a reoccurring problem with anything sleeveless from retailer these days. please don't drop the armholes so low  most women do not want their bra completely showing every time you lift your arm!
1,"This is a sweater i love to look at and wear for any occasion. it looks on me almost exactly like the model picture in the online photo. i'm 5'6"". i bought a small and it fits very loose and comfortable. i would suggest 1 size smaller than usual would fit well. i usually wear small for tops and medium dresses. it is great to layer with a brown or rusty copper large cardigan. it has a somewhat southwest blanket look with its colors of soft apricot and soft brown plus 1 turquoise stripe. it dresse"
1,This tank is very loose fitting  which i can understand would make some think it runs large. taking into account the fabric and the twisted straps  i personally think it would look ridiculous if it was more fitted. i love the draped styling  which i also think makes sense with the pattern. it's an easy top too...just throw on and go. and the loose fit is perfect for the disgustingly hot and humid summer months here in the midwest.
0,I typically take a m or a l in retailer tops/sweaters  so i ordered one of each  as this has been on back-order for forever. the medium was swimming on me - and i have a very athletic frame  with huge traps and biceps. i could have easily taken this in a small and still had plenty of length in the sleeves - and i have very long arms.   ---------  this sweater is thick and heavy. there's no way here in atlanta it can be worn anytime other than spring and the occasional very  very cool summer night.
0,This just did not sit well on me. while the length was fine and the fabric was a nice thick weave with a flattering amount of stretch  the twist at the shoulder just looked odd. it did not sit flat at all  so it just looked like i had gotten dressed in the dark and had not managed to sort out my sleeves. given the spot-on quality  i would definitely look into other items from this brand  but back this dress went.
0,If your hips are bigger than a size 6 us you can't fully close this robe. the model must be wearing the larger of the two sizes to have such a nice oversized fit. the fabric is soft and lux and amazing  but the weird dart in the back and the closure is right over my sadly size 8 hips and butt. if i was taller and thinner i would have kept this and worn it every day.
0,Beautiful dress. good quality. tts. i'm 5 feet 120 lbs. ordered my small petite. no issues. however  the green is very bright. the deal killer for me was when my hub said it looked like a starbucks barista's apron! it's going back. i marked yes if you plan on purchasing a black dress it's a yes.
-1,Got this in wine  very pretty and soft. but so sheer  even with the dark color one would have to wear a cami. returning for this reason. having to wear a cami wrecks the otw ultra-comfort.
1,Absolutely beautiful and well made. this pair of jeans is perfect  no flaws whatsoever. i usually wear size 27 but bought the 26 as it fits better. 27 is very slightly loose but i think it supposed to be like that for a boyfriend jeans. i prefer it nice and fitted  so 26 works better. i'm lucky to find them still available in the store while it's not online. i didn't hesitate to buy at full price  which i rarely did. i'm so in love with my new purchase. very happy!
1,Everything about this top is perfect! quality is great which is number one in my book. color is awesome! perfect color for fall  summer and spring! a must have!!
1,Very cute dress for 5'5 or taller
0,The top is really cute  but it's see through and the material doesn't seem like the highest quality. definitely not worth the price.
1,I love this top! it is modest enough for work  but fun enough for weekends. soft  comfortable  and lovely pink color. i want it in every color! (it seems to only come in two colors  though.)  soft flowy fabric  is lined with a soft inner fabric as well. super flattering for any body type!
-1,Detailed beading was beautiful. it's too boxy  way to much fabric in the waist/bust and tight on the hips. it doesn't fall boxy/boyfriend like. the grey fabric is not soft and is lighter in color than the picture. was hoping this would be my go to sweater for warmth on casual days-bummed.
-1,I ordered the blue version of this dress thinking the accent stripes were black. they were not ! they were wine colored. i liked the color  but not in combination with the other colors in the dress. black would have been a better look. i had to take it back. sad...
-1,"I'm 5'4""  32c and 125 lbs. i ordered the size 4p and while the color and fabric is pretty  the back and front bodice were much to low to wear a bra even if i were to shorten the straps. it was also very tight across my ribs. despite ordering a petite  the hem was much too long. i ended up returning it."
1,I am so in love with this top. can be worn on or off the shoulders. the color is amazing!
1,This dress is absolutely adorable. runs true to size  i am five foot nine and a medium fit perfect. the denim has a lot of stretch. i can't wait to wear it in the winter with tights and boots! don't wait too long before this one sells out.
0,As the other reviewer said  this top is pretty short. nice design but i wish it was a little longer  and i am short... i tried on xxs regular  xs petite and xs regular.    xxs was closest to flattering around the top part (shoulders  cehst)  but stil la bit short. the petite was jsut too short and xs regular  a bit longer  but a little loose... os hte fit jsut ddind't work. i may wait for sale on this  but probably something beter wil lcome along.    great for those who want to show their assets
-1,I ordered this blouse online bc i couldn't find it in my local stores once it was on sale. the fabric is so delicate. the cutouts had already frayed and in some places torn. had to return it.
1,This shirt spoke to me  as soon as i entered the store! i love the colorful plaid  the flattering cut  and the light  airy material. at very least  i think this will be a three-season go to!
1,"I love this dress  i love the style  i love the pattern  i love the feel of the fabric. there's a slight puffiness to the shoulders that surprised and delighted me. however  i think it runs a little large  particularly because it's not fitted at all - that tie around the waist is the only defining feature  and it's a great one: this dress (and your figure) needs it. i am 135 pounds  5'5""  and i normally wear a 6. perhaps i should've known to try a small  but i went with my usual size in dresses"
-1,"At 5'4""  i guess i am just too short to pull this dress off! the colors are so pretty for summer  but there is just too much fabric... i felt like i was wearing a giant doily! however  there is not a doubt in my mind that taller girls would look fabulous in this!"
1,I have been looking for a summer dress with a bit of a chic flair to it- i was thinking black  tank top dress. after weeks of hunting for the idea in my head  i started to branch out. i reluctantly tried this on thinking it would be 'baggish'  plain  and possibly too short. wow was i wrong!! this dress is everything + more. wear with some wedges  belt it (although it doesn't need it at all!)  layer a high neckline lace top over it  the possibilities are endless. although i loved the green  the b
1,"I am 5' 2"" about 118 lbs. thought this fit really well. very comfortable material. i wish the skirt was a different color-feels a little bland."
1,Love the fit and color  but the material is my favorite. it's so soft and comfy. feels like your walking around in your pjs!
-1,"I love the look of this dress on model but sadly  fit didn't work out. very short waisted and tight across chest with very ample arm holes. i'm 5'8""  155  34c  reliably a size 10. this dress seemed at least 2 sizes off for me. my daughter  usually a size 2  could wear it except for the arm hole size (and the fact that it's 158 dollars and she's 13....going back.) btw  ""novelty print"" means ""ice cream novelty""  little popsicles with bites taken out - cute but more juvenile than i expected."
-1,I really wanted to like this dress  but where the skirt meets the top of the dress in the back creates sort of a hunchback effect in the back. will be returning.
0,These leggings are great in quality and are thick enough to wear as pants; the rise is perfect. the only issue is that they stretch during wear and end up being a size larger.
-1,Looks great on the photo and from previous reviews i decided to give it a try. the material seems cheap and stiff. would not fit my frame well.
1,Really cute romper that can be dressed up or down. super comfortable and flattering. i ordered the xs and it fit perfect.
1,Found this dress on the sale rack  but the store did not have my size. fortunately they were able to order & ship it free. the colors & fabric caught my eye right away. it reminds me of a vintage apron print  but in a good way. i'm tall with a long torso & i  had to lower the waist tie.
0,I'm actually surprised no one has reviewed this yet. i took the plunge because it seemed like a classic wardrobe staple  nothing too flashy or fancy  that would go well with many outfits. my thoughts below:  __________________  pros:  - fits tts. i'm normally either a 10 or 12 and got the large. it fit well and the elastic isn't too tight. fit very well for me because i have wider hips. so if you're straight or slim  you could probably size down.  - exactly as pictured. it does have a nice flow
0,Loved the color and looked super cute in the photo but when i got it home it was way too big in chest area  waist area & too wide at bottom. i'm pretty small but i'm not sure what the right body shape would be for this.
1,"This dress is extremely comfortable and flattering. it has a forgiving a line shape to it for women like me who are pear shaped. the top of the dress is made of a heavy type of cotton material and the bottom tiers are made of a silky material that hangs beautifully! even the tie closure in the back of the dress adds a lovely touch to the dress. i would recommend wearing it with leggings ( as shown with the model) or black tights. the fit is true to size. i am 5'6"" and the length is a liittle low"
0,This is such a cute design  but it's so short! it barely hits at my hips. you'd have to wear a layer under it to keep your tummy from being exposed. i'm also not thrilled with the buttons - i am a 34c bra size and the second button was gaping open on the size 4 top. i wish they'd been sewn shut - the neckline is so big  it's not like the buttons need to function. i got the burgundy with pink flowers and the colors are great. too bad it's so short and gapes open at the bust. going back.
0,I got this shirt and loved it so much the first time i wore it. it swings well and is an easy basic that looks great. however  after i washed it the first time  it became clingy and stuck to me and doesn't lie right. it's such a shame because i was thrilled with this as an addition to my wardrobe!
-1,The dresss is much shorter than described. very see thru  though guess you can tell from picture. expected more for the price.
0,Very high quality dress. there are two layers  (the under navy and over white crochet) which makes this worth the price. however it is very straight  making the dress fit like a bag if you have hips or boobs. tried petite and regular and both were too baggy even in xs.
-1,Ladies this top shrinks!!! i am very disappointed  i was in love with this top and the first time i washed it it shrunk a significant amount. i did not use a dryer  i laid this piece out to dry as i do with the majority of my knit tops and it shrunk. it is a lot shorter and much tighter  especially in my arms. if you love this top i might suggest buying a size up and washing it to fit.
1,I ordered this bra in my normal size 32d  and it fits me perfectly. this bra is beautiful. the material seems to be very high quality  and the comfort of this bra is amazing. it's definitely a keeper.
-1,I really wanted to love this dress  but i couldn't. it ran large and heavy. rather than a sleek cocktail dress  it felt more like a heavy sack once i put it on. there was one upside: the drape in the back did not appear to drop quite as low  so finding a bra to wear under the dress might be easier than if it draped as low as it appears in the picture.
1,Reference: 100#  5'1  32a... ordered size xs.  the suit is pretty.  under the neckline  where the two orange panels meet the white center panel  that corner puckers a bit.  this will not happen if you have a larger chest than my 32a or have a longer/broader torso so that the fabric can stretch out  thus pulling that merging area flat.  the sides (cut out) lays flat when you stand up straight and gapes when your turn/bend to the side.  i think this is expected.  the bottom section  on the back  c
0,I ordered this dress and have sent it back. i think it could be a flattering dress; the waist hit quite a bit above my natural waist which made the entire thing fit weirdly. i am very long waisted  so this might just be a problem for me. i ordered regular size 2.
-1,"I noticed this top on one of the sales associates  and it looked great. she's probably 230lbs and about 5'5.  tried it on and it looked horrible  i even tried sizing down twice. i'm 5'8"" and the ruffles started right under my chest. i gave 2 stars bc of the material  it is light  and summery."
-1,This dress overwhelmed me. i'm 5 feet tall and the print and material just took over.
-1,"I wanted to love this sweater but it is a return. it is a very weird fit  very thick  rug-like material and unfitted. the shoulders are bulky  the top is big and the booty is small. i am 5'2""  34c and typically wear a small. the arms were very long  way too long. i will say other than that the top was true to size  may look okay on someone who had a larger chest and a smaller bum!"
0,"I wanted to love this dress. i ordered an xsmall and a small. i am 5'6"" and 110 lbs  slender build. the xsmall fit great everywhere but the waist band was completely out of portion for the dress. both sizes will have to be returned. possibly if you have a more straight up and down figure it will fit better and pull in your waist!"
1,"The quality of this sweater is excellent. it is well work the money. i am 34d 5'4"" and purchased a medium. fits perfectly for a fitted look and hits right at my natural waistline."
-1,I own many blouses by tiny. the arms on this blouse billow out which was not flattering or thinning on me. the shirt was just blah.
-1,I had hoped this bulky knit would be cuddly and soft  with suri (a type of alpaca) in the title. i don't know if the blend (45% polyamide  25% royal baby alpaca  20% fine merino) threw it  but had i felt this in store  i would never have even picked it up. unimpressed.
0,I ordered this top online and was hoping to love it  however it didn't fit me properly...the arm holes were much too large (i'm typically an xs or small) i ordered the small and based on this fit i don't think the extra small would've fit either :( also i thought the material seemed very delicate and somewhat thin....and with 3 kids always hanging on me i don't think this top would last very long...
0,These sleep pants are very pretty  soft and comfortable. unfortunately  after washing them once i noticed some small holes in the fabric which is very disappointing considering the price. i don't mind paying a little more for clothing if i feel like the quality is there but in this case i'm not so sure. i guess if you don't really sleep in them or wash them then they would probably be ok but then what's the point of buying them?
1,I found this today on the one and only rack. i absolutely fell in love with it. i bought my normal size medium and it fit perfectly. other customers were asking where they could find it in the store. i highly recommend. it can be dressed up or down.
0,The sleeves were very tight in the upper arm area but the body was blousy  too blousy so to go up a size for the arms would mean it would be very oversized in the body. i like the fabric (nice and thick) but it did not work for me.
0,Loved this shirt so much that i bought in 3 colors. love the luxurious feel of the silky  flowing fabric that flatters in all the best ways. however  after washing per instructions  the fabric lost its good qualities and turned into a blah  pilled mess that gathers at the seams (especially the bottom seam). tried dry cleaning another shirt and it came out the same way as washing. looks like a cheap  lackluster layering top now and definitely won't last another season. so disappointed - if you ca
-1,I'd been waiting to snatch up this jumpsuit as it looks so cute online  so when it went on sale i ordered it right away. well i was thoroughly disappointed. i agree with some of the other reviewers  the fit is odd  huge on top and too snug on the bottom. being made of flimsy silk it has no give and didn't hang well on my curvy body  being too loose in some areas and too snug in others. also the top is embroidered while the bottom isn't. the material is thin and and it definitely isn't high enoug
0,I like the idea of the pullover. the quality of is nice; the material is very soft and feels pleasant to the touch.    i expected this sweater to be more flattering though. it is true to size  but the length is strange. it seems a bit too long  yet is too short to look like a longer tunic. or maybe the waistline is a little low... whatever it is  it makes me look like i have short legs.    also  the collar won't stay down  the way it is shown in the picture. but it may work better for someone wi
-1,I bought this shirt immediately because of the pattern  when it arrived i was super confused. it's not a tee shirt like it looks like in the photos. it's made with cotton fabric with a tiny bit of stretch. i ordered the xl because i have brought shoulders and 36e bras size and it fits like a 2x or larger. i would say order two sizes down. also it hangs like a maternity shirt. i might order it once it's on sale  which it definitely will be  but even then am not positive i would keep it.
1,I ordered this last week and received it yesterday and have to say it is a lovely dress. the fabric is light but looks quite rich  making one want to touch the textile. the dress pattern reminds me of a missoni. oh  the dress is lined. i purchased the blue pattern  and am planning on wearing it to work on friday.
-1,I ordered this 3 months ago  and it finally came off back order. a huge disappointment. the fit wasn&#39;t so much the issue for me. the quality of the wool is subpar. someone else mentioned a &quot;felted wool&quot;...i guess  is that what you call it?  it does literally feel like felt! super thin  itchy  doesn&#39;t drape very well  and feels cheap (made in china). i got it on sale  but still not worth what i paid. definitely going back.

0,I don't think they are an easy fit cut  they are more like skinny jeans. as i was looking for something more relaxed i decided to return them. the quality of the material is good  the color is nice.
0,The material of the shirt and the ties are two different materials. the shirt is a very soft cotton  but the ties are of a more dressier material. i expected the shirt to be of the dressier material. overall it is a cute shirt  just not what i expected.
1,This dress is perfect. it's ridiculously soft (i felt like i was wearing pajamas) and it fits perfectly. the quality is great; well worth your purchase.
1,I was a bit dubious of the top because online the video of it made the top look frumpy - wide and wrinkled looking. the top seemed shorter in the video than in the pictures. so i wondered if the images were massaged a bit in photoshop. i got it today and it's fully lined and the material is pretty thick which gives it a rich look and feel. i like the top even though it highlights my hips a bit and being pear-shaped i don't normally like that  but being thin helps. the best part of the top is the
1,This was a return in my sale room and i just decided to try it on. love it! fits true to size thought kind of hard to zip up all the way. colors are great. got the petite size. the pattern is different for each one so each is unique. mine has. lot more navy blue.
0,I love the fabric and design of these leggings  but unfortunately they ran way to big up top. they literally fall down.
1,I think it's a little on the long side and the sleeves are a little tight but otherwise i really like this jacket. it's lightweight for summer and yet more stylish than the other long sleeve things i grab in case i get cold.
1,I love camisoles like this  and retailer always has great ones! it has a nice length  so the lace detail can show underneath a jacket or shorter cardigan. it's fitted  but not tight.
0,This skirt and top is nothing like the picture. the skirt is black not maroon. top is also black. although the skirt is nice  the image was fabulous. the side panels of the skirt are also a knit. quality is good but skirt is overpriced for what it is. would have expected suede or leather panels for the money. not sure if going to keep or not. was really looking for the maroon color instead of the black.
1,Really love this bathing suit. it fits very well  definitely don't need to size up for this one. flattering to my mom-bod and breasts that have seen perkier days. excited to be taking this one to costa rica with me this summer!
-1,This dress is beautiful and extremely well made... if you can get into it. the only way to close the dress is a line of difficult to button buttons up the back. it's form fitting  so you'd better be on your yoga a game or have a loved one or hand maiden to lend a hand. i thought about taking it to a tailor to install a hidden side zipper  but it's soooo form fitting i'm afraid i wouldn't wear it.
-1,This is a beautiful dress  but the fit was strange. i have a small waist and larger hips. i generally wear a 0-2 in a fit & flare style  but styles like this i generally wear a 2-4 for my hips. even in a 4 this was catching on my hips and looked kind of dumpy on my top half.  i really think this dress would be great on a frame that had wider shoulders and smaller hips. it really is pretty.
1,Love this! fits great. warm and soft. would recommend
0,Love the color and design but way to small. i can wear a small in many manufacturers but certainly not in this one. the medium was like an extra small. sorry because i liked what i saw in the advertisement. as an older lady i love your well made  fresh  styles but need to be able to trust that a size is true to form.
-1,"The design of this dress was very off for my 5'4""  120 lb  32d frame. it's low-cut and tight in the bust  but then very voluminous and unstructured around the hips  making me look wide there. a belt didn't help much. the fabric is nice  but the overall effect of the dress was frumpy."
-1,Dress just did not fit will around the hips.  also the string belt was defective - basically about to come off.  looks like someone may have wore it and returned it.  was not flattering at all.
1,Love this shirt. tried it on in 2 of the colors and both were very flattering. the quality of the shirt is great. worth the price for sure!
-1,Bought the gold pair and dripped something on them so spot cleaned them with water only. my white washcloth turned bright yellow. the food came out but surrounding area was super faded. so i returned them  took the second pair home  wore them a few times  they stretched out so much  washed them in cold water and they have splotches that are really light. these pants are way too much trouble.
1,Love love the print on these but the fit is off. i tried on the solid color in this same style and i took my regular size 30. these i needed a 12. the waist seems really small but the bottom leg parts stretch out and are kind of baggy after 1 wear. i can't go down a size because the waist was too small on the 10. since i love the print so much it may be tolerable. rare for hei hei to fit wonky.
1,As one would expect from boucle  this sweater is incredibly soft  warm and cozy without being heavy. i fell in love with it when i first saw it and got it in white color. it's beautiful  goes with casual and work clothing (belt helps with the latter styling)  and it didn't leave lint on the dark skirt i wore with it to work! i usually wear xs or s and found this sweater to be still roomy in xs  with sleeves being a bit long. i hope it won't stretch with wear as boucles sometimes do - that's my o
1,Like all maeve tops of this nature  i am absolutely in love! maeve always has a cute spin on an otherwise basic top. this top looks great with jeans  shorts  skirts  etc. i purchased it in all 3 colors. the blue is more of a robins egg blue  the orange is a great tangerine color (perfect for us tennessee fans!)  and the ivory is a wonderful brownish-white. the ivory is my favorite because it's a very unique color.. i have a ton of white and ivory tops  but i do not have one in a color like this
0,This brand has odd fitting of late. i normally wear a m in retailer tops but i had to size up to 12 on this shirt as it was tight across my chest. i am a b cup and had a sports bra on when i tried it. brought it home and tried on with a regular  non pushup bra and it pulls slightly. i might return it because my guess is that it will shrink when washed. otherwise  its a cute tunic style top.
0,Overall  the dress is beautiful  easy  and great quality. but the bottom part has more fabric than it appears in the photo  if that makes sense. it's not poofy or super-layered  but i had to pinch fabric on a part of the dress in order for it to have that more straight/shift shape that you see online here. besides that bottom part  the fit is true to size. but as a petit  the extra fabric isn't what i'm looking for. i think it works depending on what you're looking for. beautiful though!
0,I love love love these pants!!! they actually fit me and look great!!!! buyer beware that the dye used is very delicate. i had a very slight stain on them that most likely only i noticed  but i decided to use a spray and wash stain remover. the resulting removal of the stain came with a very large loss of color anywhere the stain remover touched. unfortunately this has made these pants unwearable. buy  wear and wash these with care!!!
0,While there is nothing wrong with this top  it didn't really have an retailer feel. it looked more like something from a dept store  maybe a boutique. i got on sale but sending back bc i just don't like it that much  especially next to my pale skin. i could see it looking much better in someone with darker skin tone. i'm usually a 8/10 med. small in this top fit well.
-1,I have somewhat sensitive skin and this fabric is awful! in addition to it having no give  feeling like it will stretch out  and being slightly see-through  it is super scratchy!! it has little bits of what look to be tree material in the fabric.. awful!
-1,Way too big and had a granny like styling. was very excited but ultimately took it back.
1,"I purchased this in the ""purple"" which is more blue than purple  but you can definitely see the purplish hue depending on the light. it's a beautiful  rich indigo color. it's very comfortable. i usually go for more fitted styles  but i was pleasantly surprised at how flattering this top is even though the body of the shirt is more loose fitting. i'm very excited to wear this top this summer. i haven't worn and washed it yet  so i am hoping the color and material will hold up after washing. i am"
1,"I have been eyeing this top for a couple weeks and finally found it in my store. it was a good sign when i saw our stores in-house stylist wearing it! i absolutely love the fit--it's soft and stretchy and fabric is nice quality. i'm typically a medium  sometimes large--i bought the medium and it's perfect. i could have gone down to a small as well. the large was way too big (for reference i'm 5'8""  athletic  150lbs). this top is going to take me everywhere this summer! worth a try!"
1,I purchased this shirt in blue and i like it. the fabric is more of a stretchy/jersey material - didn't expect that. but the shirt looks decent on and is comfortable.
0,Runs really big. i usually wear small and this was falling off my shoulders. very comfortable and soft material. also looks brighter in pic than in person.
1,Very cute. i received many compliments when i wore it. fits true to size (petite 2) with some good stretch in it. i am 5'3 and it was slightly longer than that on the model. it is a little odd that the buttons are all not the same. but perhaps that is part of its charm and it is not noticeable. it is very comfortable and the pictures are representative of what it looks like.
0,"Soft  cozy  and cute  but pilled badly after 1st wearing and now will be relegated to wearing at home only. for this reason i cannot recommend. felt like i wasted my money. i purchased the xs petite ( i'm 5'1"". 95 lbs) and i could have gone down to xxs  but i was ok with it being looser."
-1,"Too much material everywhere. i am 122lbs 5'4"" and i ordered an xs as usual. i was overwhelmed in a blanket of knitted material of muted colors. nice green slip  though. i will return it asap. this is super-ugly."
-1,I loved the design online but the sweater is bulky and boxy. i had chosen the cream with blue and now looking back at the other pictures of the beige/cream it represents it better. it made me look very wide. loved it online but it wasn't for me  returned it.
1,I ordered top and pants online as seen. pants are of good quality and hang beautiful.  i love the color and quality of the fabric. nice and vibrant. nice fit at the top into a flowy drape. the top runs big and glad i ordered down one size. love the outfit for my upcoming island trip.
1,I got the navy blue pattern and i absolutely love it. it's soft and cozy and just dressy enough to pull an outfit together.  i initially sized up to a 10 based on other reviews but exchanged it for an 8  my normal size. it's flowy so the bigger size was way too much fabric. in the 8 it's just right for the style.
0,"The dress is too big. i got size 4  after checking the measurements chart (for reference: 5'7""  125 lb). it is too wide  not as fitted as in the picture. the cut is too deep (might work better for a bustier lady  but looks pathetic on me).     the pattern is too bright  much brighter that in the picture (i got red pattern). it's not that the photos represent the colors inaccurately  it's just... the colors are much more vibrant in real life.    the material is heavier than i expected."
-1,This dress was very boxy and unflattering. i really wanted to like it because the blue and white details were so pretty but it had to go back.
-1,I really loved the way this shirt looked on me. it's forgiving and flattering  and really lightweight. the fabric  however  couldn't even withstand half a day's wear without snagging 3 times and developing a hole right in the center. i have no idea how this happened  as i wasn't wearing or near anything that could have pulled at it.     such a shame. this could have been a staple wardrobe piece for me.
0,This top is a little more casual than i anticipated especially for the price. it is completely sheer and you do need a tank under it. also  the arm and neck makes it look more like a ordinary teeshirt. still  the lace design is super cute and would work well with both skirts and jeans.
0,I wanted to love this dress! i ordered it when there was a 20 percent off special and couldn't wait to get it. the colors are as depicted and the dress fit true to size. i also liked that it wasn't too short. what i didnt like was that the dress is lined in white  which you can plainly see in the picture  but i didnt notice before ordering. i just think it would have been much prettier lined in black. im disappointed and the dress is going back.
-1,Bought this shirt on sale. it was super cute in the dressing room  and for the first time i wore it. washed it per the instructions (wash delicate with cold water  lay flat to dry) and it shrunk so much i don't think i'm going to be able to wear it anymore. it was oversized and loose when i bought it  so it shrunk a lot. there is also a small hole all of the sudden  that i have no idea where it came from (wasn't there when i put it in the washer). very disappointed.
1,"The colors on these leggings are just beautiful!  the material is very soft and has a nice thickness to it.  no issues with see thru material.  i am 5'8""  145  and i ordered my usual medium."
0,"This dress has so much potential but doesn't make it.  i read all the reviews and very few were favorable and still took my chances. fabric color and textures is great but the design is really off.  with the little folds on the shoulder and since the fabric is more on the thick side  all this make it to accumulate the ""extra"" weight on the front of the body and as result ""not flattering"" for the majority of ladies including me  it is a shame since it has may great features  the style: flowy  low"
1,Walked into the retailer store in new york  while on vacation  and saw this on display. had to try it on immediately and loved the look. received several compliments from customers in the store. it's beautifully made  soft on the inside and makes a great statement piece that i will enjoy for years to come!! you will need to size down cause it runs large. i love it............
0,"The fabric of this dress feels like suede  i couldn't stop touching it. here comes the ""but"": the dress is cut straight down  no definition. the rosette lace is sewn on  like an afterthought just to make the dress not to look plain or cheap. i tried it on with a belt and by itself  and i still feel like it's just a plain dress that i can get at a discount store. i'm a big fan of tracey reese and own a lot of her dresses  and i feel that this is the most plain dress she ever designed. size s regu"
0,I ordered a size 0. the dress was extremely large. i am 5'2 and weigh 110. i guess you really must be 5'9 like the model to wear this dress. such a shame..
0,I wanted to love these  but the zipper is extremely short and they were not flattering on my thicker thighs and large behind. the fabric is so soft  however and the color is great. would work on a less curvy woman!
-1,I ordered a size small (usually i am ps) but wanted the extra length. usually i can get away with a regular small but not this time. such a cute style but made me look short & wide. unfortunately it's going back
0,"This picture does not do this skirt justice. it is gorgeous. however  the waist was so small that the sequins dug into my waist making me think of a medieval torture device. unfortunately  it was the largest size so i can't size up. i'm 4'11"" so the length was perfect - it came to right above my knees. i love the skirt so much that i'm considering liposuction."
-1,I tried this top on thinking it would be cute for the summer. it looked more like a maternity top with the fullness in the bottom. so if you're expecting  this one would be great.
-1,I love my very old pilcro stet jeans. they are the perfect denim weight  and the back pockets are set in a way that is very flattering for the tush. not so with the newer pilcros unfortunately. the denim is thinner and may have more stretch and they get worn and pill on my inner thighs. and the back pockets are set far apart making my back side look unnaturally wide. it's a bummer.
-1,I was obsessed with this top. i ordered my normal 4 and was bummed about the fit in the shoulders. the slight puff was too far in  it didn't hit on my shoulder. so i returned it to a store and ordered a 6. it came quickly but it was still too narrow in the shoulders. i took it to the store and held it against the 4 and the seam was the same length between the neck and shoulder as the 4. both returned. i had no hope for an 8.
1,This is seriously a beautiful dress. it has such gorgeous colors. it's lined so no slip needed. it is flowy and just the right length. i went with a petite and it is perfect.. can't wait to use it at the beach.
-1,I love maeve and was so excited for this top which looked like an update from a last season favorite. unfortunately the fabric was stiff  it was tight in the chest and went straight down from there. returned.
1,I went to retailer for a pair of pants and walked out with this tunic in the blue motif and the pilcro cords in dark turquoise. this sweater  like the one i purchased last season by the same designer  is well made and the fabric is luxuriously soft (like cashmere soft). am so excited that the weather is finally cooling down to wear it!
-1,I love(d) this top. it was my go to top even in the heat  the fabric is light and breathes. however  pulled it out of the washing mashing to find that the sleeve has shredded away from the body. it could not be repaired. i am so disappointed as i really loved everything about it.
0,I loved this when i saw it arrive in the mail. as soon as i put it on though  i was drowning in it. i know its a cape and it is suppose to be large but it was so big i had to return it. i still really like it and wish it would have worked. i am 5'5  athletic/slim figure just for reference.
1,I love this dress  it's very comfortable  slim swing and very ingratiating. the fabric is light  i like the details of the buttons on the sleeves. overall  i'm pleased and happy for the purchase of this dress. i will definitely recommend it.
0,Love the feel and comfort
-1,I was really excited about this skirt because i love the color. however when i tried it on  it was too much of a high/low. i am not very tall but this would look a lot better on a tall person.
-1,The fabric is a nice weight knit and the top generally well made. unfortunately  the fit was enormous. i've an athletic build w/ big boobs & normally wear l in retailer tops.
0,Material is very thin  and although this is apparent in the design  i just didn't like the way the cuffed sleeves felt...
-1,I tried this dress on in store. i loved it online  but in person....not so much. it looked and felt like a cheap halloween costume. the fabric was bad. really bad.. the mustard color was beautiful.... boo
0,The colors of this top are perfect for spring  i love the embroidery and like the sleeves with the ties at the bottom. what i didn't like and primary reason i may be returning  is the elastic bottom. it cuts off at an awkward spot on my waist and makes my top section look short and wide. i am very disappointed about this  as the rest of the blouse is gorgeous.
1,This dress is so pretty- the colors are vibrant  beautiful pattern  the ruched part in the center hides the tummy!!! the neck line was too low for me  so had to wear a red cami underneath which hid the skin showing parts in the back around the waist. so instead of skin color  it was now red- even more prettier! no body could tell!! got so many compliments!!!
-1,I loved this shirt when it first arrived and i couldn't wait to wear it. after one day of wear  i went to hang the shirt back up and it was ripping on both sides of the middle back seem. this shirt was not tight on me at all. very disappointed.
1,"This dress is stunning! my sister-in-law was hoping to use it as a bridesmaid dress for her wedding and i ordered it for fitting purposes. it fit beautifully on my 5'10"" frame. unfortunately she decided against it due to availability and because of the length on the shorter bridesmaids. while it fell to a couple inches above my ankles  it made the shorter girls look shorter. i ended up returning it but am regretting not keeping it now!"
-1,Quality piece except the fit is way off. i have a 32 c bust and long narrow torso  larger on the bottom. i ordered the small. i frequently wear a small/extra small on top and i was busting out of this in the chest area. however  the fit then flares way out from the torso and it just looked dumpy and overpowered my 6 foot frame. i marked it as running small  which it does on top  but then it runs very large on bottom. wanted it to work  but didn't.
0,I ordered this on-line. while it fits well before washing  the fabric is a bit thin. i'm afraid it might shrink in the wash  too. i haven't worn it yet because i'm trying to decide it i will keep it or return it. colors are a bit more muted than i would like also.

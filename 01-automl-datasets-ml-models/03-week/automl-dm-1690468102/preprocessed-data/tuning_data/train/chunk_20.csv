-1,Like most people here  i wanted this beautiful dress to fit. so  i decided to see for myself if maybe  just maybe the negative reviews were wrong. they weren't. if you have any sort of breasts at all  the top probably won't fit properly. i imagine a narrow upper torso  like a 32 or 33  possibly a 34 might find the top part of the dress closes properly  but with a 36 c  i could not get a size 12 to button up. the waist hit at a strange spot  and despite the picture showing a narrow waist and grad
0,I thought this top was absolutely beautiful! i couldn't wait to get it in but unfortunately it was very big on me. (i'm 5 ft  105 lbs and got the pxs) the arm holes were so big as well as the overall fit. i'm very disappointed  i really wanted this top to work.
1,Flattering! i love how it looks like a maxi dress.  fits me perfectly!
1,"Beautiful spring dress. perfect for luncheons or any occasion. so very pretty  lovely fabric and good fit. you will definitely feel pretty in this dress. y daughter is 5'3"" and the length was perfect."
1,"I ordered this in xs  i'm 5'4""  around 115lbs  and it fits perfectly. the material is very soft  but not see-through  and the romper is well-made. i wish it came in other colours  i'd buy more!"
0,Very cute coat but could not keep it for the price...just not sure it is worth almost $200 00 (with tax added to cost). when it goes on sale  i will most likely buy it.
1,Cozy. soft. comfortable. a perfect transitional top that bubbles over with personality..it's a unique fabric design that makes you feel like you're on vacation ..love it.
1,This is a fun sparkly top that was great over the holidays with a sparkly long-sleeved top underneath  and will be fun in the summer too. i got a size small since my regular size extra-small was sold out  and it was still really cute. great cut and design. as others have mentioned  the quality could be slightly better  but it's a good deal if you get it on sale.
0,Do not under estimate the boxy shape of this it looks kind of like a hospital scrub. i think with this top the styling is key. the sleeves are long and boxy and the neckline is somewhat of an oval so for me this wasn't a top i could just throw on without doing some outfit editing.i styled this with a dark high waisted skinny jean which i tucked the shirt into and some red heels and i was ready to go. anyways the material was great it was a silk type polyester that didn't seem to be static prone
1,Bought these over the weekend and i am in love! they are very soft  extremely flattering  and the rich green color is fantastic. i may go back for the black. i went with my usual size 28 for reference  and the fit is great. these will be a fall staple  for sure!
-1,I ordered these a size up because i'd just had a baby and knew i needed a bigger size. my pre-pre baby size (chubby phase) were size 8/29. these fit like a size 4. way too small. very disappointed!
-1,I was so excited to splurge on a mara hoffman suit and was sorely disappointed when i received this suit in the mail. i'm petite and fairly curvy  so i knew it would likely be a little long in the torso but the whole suit was so oddly shaped  i couldn't imagine anyone it would fit. the square shape in between the halter pieces is awkward  and the pieces that are supposed to hold your chest are super wide and loose.
1,"I am 5' 4"" and 128 lbs and could have worn the 4 or 6 but took the 6. it does run short and the length in the 6 was better than the 4 with arm hole size being the same. the bees are embroidered making the fabric high quality and normally i would run from a print like this but not this one. it has great style!"
0,I ordered this sweater in black and thought it was a pretty design and something different in a cardigan. when i tried it on  it was an odd fit and very boxy and unflattering. i wanted to like it and keep it  but i knew i would not wear it so  unfortunately  it went back.
-1,I loved this shirt when i purchased it but it shrank badly and the front seam (on mine) was crooked. no longer have my receipt so not sure i can return it~ sigh. i do love the pilcro chinos i bought to go with it however!
-1,Gorgeous color and great price  but too low cut and because of the design  a cami's wouldn't work. disappointed
0,"Adorable top  but i have to agree with what two other reviewers said... that is is boxy and unflattering. i have a similar patterned top  also by maeve  but the sizing on that runs small  medium  large. the s petite that i have doesn't fit quite the same as the 4 petite in this blouse. this is definitely more ""square"" in the torso  and the ruffles do stick out more - very flouncy. it just made me look frumpy instead of the sexy date night look i was going for. i am 5' and 120 lbs. also  i didn't"
-1,"The model looks awesome in this cute top  but on me it looked boxy but was too tight around the chest and was too short (for reference  i'm 5'7 "" 140 lbs.  and 34c). the front is non-stretchy eyelet lace cotton fabric  yet the back is stretchy. in theory  it's pretty  but in reality it doesn't work - at least for me. i think it might work for someone petite with a smaller chest."
1,This shirt is beautiful and well-made. the lace is soft - not scratchy at all. looks great with a cream or gray cami underneath.
1,These jeans were not for me. they are very straight...hence the name 'parallel'. i'm have more of a straight athletic build so for me it was too much straight and didn't flatter my shape at all.    however  very nice jean once again from pilcro.
1,I loveeeeeeee this dress! i saw it online and immediately loved the blue/ orange large floral print but so did everyone else and it sold out quick. but i thought the shape could be flattering so i ordered in the black polka dot and loved the shape! so flattering. i ended up going in store and buying the other two colors. the patterns are vibrant and lovely shape. my only concern was seeing it in store i noticed it stretching while just hanging on the hanger. i wish the fabric was of better quali
0,First off  the other reviews are spot on regarding the quality of this top. the material is thick and pleasant feeling  the print is beautiful and the construction is nicely done. however  i just couldn't get past the fit issue  which was also mentioned by the other reviewers. i ordered a 14 for my 38 dd chest  and it was loose in all the wrong places. i'd be interested to see what a 12 looks like on me  but i'm afraid it would be too snug. this may look awesome on someone else  but i had to ret
0,The vest looks  so stylish on. it makes a regular t shirt look edgy with it on. i love the vest but the price is too high
0,This sweater is extremely roomy. the cut is very wide - wider than it is long  the sleeves are dolman style  and the neck is a little loose. with a lot of manipulation i managed to convince myself that i wasn't wearing a tent  but i would suggest sizing down and also being tall and thin  if you can. i'm keeping mine despite a funky fit on my hourglass frame because i'm exploring funky town lately. join me at your own risk!
1,Beautiful white denim pants. the fit is perfect. fitted on the top with a nice flare on the bottom. very classy and versatile cut. paige denim runs long for me and these are no exception. will be getting them hemmed but i don't mind because they are perfect!
-1,Love the shape and flow of this dress. but i was sent a dirty stained dress so this is going back.  would not recommend
-1,At first i was taken by the beautiful lacework and the pictures online showing what appeared to be a loose but shaped silhouette. the pictures must have been staged with pins in the back because  in person  the shirt fits like a circus tent. without exaggeration  there is a surplus of about 16 inches.    the material is still beautiful. and because of that  i haven't decided whether i'll return this shirt or try cutting out some excess fabric to create a cleaner  more fitted shape.
1,"I like this sweater so much i just bought it in a second color! the pleats make the sweater conform to my shape just enough to be flattering. i wore it over three different dresses this week that might have felt too bare for work or cooler weather. i live in a hot climate so this is the right weight for our cooler months. the metallic threads give it a little bit of flair and the grey color goes with everything. i'm 5'7"" size 10-12 and the large fit just right."
1,"I received many compliments on this dress. for a maeve dress it did run large. i normally take a 4 or 6 in maeve but with this dress i bought the size 2 and it fits perfect. i am 5' 2"" and 120 lbs. i have a little belly and this dress hides it well. beautiful colors and nice shape. it also hits at my knee so it is perfect for work."
0,These lightweight  wide leg pilcro summer jeans are really cute  but did not look good on me. i love the fabric-a slightly 'nubby' no stretch chambray that is perfect for hot weather. the waist was a bit large and there was fabric to spare in the hip area. the legs are very wide  adding to the comfort factor of these! the details are really cute-contrasting fabric at the slash front and rear pockets. i got a size ten in these and they were big-i can imagine they will stretch out with wear so it
0,I love the fabric and pattern of this dress so much that i decided to keep it (got it on mega sale)  but i would have never paid full price or anything close. the armholes are enormous  showing bra and all. i am not particularly large chested (34c)  and the buttons are stretched to gaping on me  even with the huge armholes. i have a cute red sweater coat that i will wear over it all fall  but i could not recommend it because of the poor cut design.  pros: great pattern  fabric  pockets  true to
1,"This top is just darling!  the body of the top is lightweight ""sweatshirt"" type material that's dyed to appear well used.  the ruffling along the bottom is color coordinated and beautifully textured.  great to wear with leggings!  the back hangs lower than the front so your rear will be covered.  extremely comfortable  machine washable.  an unexpectedly ""nicer than it looks online"" garment.  i bought the blue version which looks more lavender irl."
-1,I loved these pants. the fit well and were flattering. unfortunately after three wears  they came apart at the seam. very disappointing and frustrating.
-1,Bummed out.. this is super cheaply made and very expensive... the design is different   the color is beautiful  but the material is a different story.. it should be priced at the most 30 bucks.. not 128.. i'm returning them. also  they run very big..!
-1,I loved fabric  print and back detail. design  however  was a little too boxy to be flattering on me. even at great price i sent it back.
1,I originally bought these jeans in my true size. after wearing them a few times i realized they stretched out quickly making it hard to wear them again. retailer recommended i go down a size and now they are my favorite jean!  they are a little tight for the first 5 mins  and then they are perfect fit wear after wear. and so soft!
1,This is probably one of the best retailer purchases i have ever made! this is the most comfy and warm cardigan and is a good thickness for fall and winter. i am 5'9  a size 6/8 and the medium was perfect! buy this now!!
0,I was very excited when this dress arrived in the mail. the fabric is so comfortable  but the print was overwhelming. it is also very tight on the top and i got lost in the fabric at the bottom. i had to return it.
-1,I love the idea of this top  but there is just way too much fabric involved in person! i'm 5'2 and usually wear a small or medium to accommodate a fuller chest. i ordered a small and it fit fine around the chest but the huge swing hem combined with the slightly stiff fabric is just enormously unflattering. i feel like they could have made about 3 shirts out of it. i think the picture must have it pinned a ton in the back  the silhouette is nothing like shown. if there were just less fabric  i wo
-1,I usually buy a pair of these kind of pants every year from this brand. they are lightweight  sturdy and very flattering to my curvier body. this brand can run big  so i usually buy a size 2 rather than my normal size 4. i was going to wait it out and let someone else try them first  but then i caved and ordered them in two sizes: 26 and 27 because they didn't label them 2  4  6 etc. anymore. these pants still look well made and have cute little details  but they are bigger than ever!! the 27's
0,I love the way this top looks in the picture and the embroidery is as lovely as it appears--very detailed. it is both subtle (not cheap looking) and special.    as an earlier reviewer noted  the top is not see-through  a plus.    the drawbacks  though  mean that i will be returning this top.     1. the fabric is very heavy and does not drape well. i am a small woman with a large chest and ordered a size 0. the top is still loose  even in that size  and the relative stiffness of the fabric gives
0,"I am 5'2"" and i typically wear a 2 or a 2p. lately i've been finding that petite is just a little too short to wear with wedges so i often order a 2 as i did in this dress. it fits well and it's flattering. my two complaints are that it gets wrinkly fast and looks sloppy. yes  linen is a wrinkly look and that's normal for linen but somehow this dress just looks sloppy to me. more importantly  while wearing for the first time  i realized that the seams on the side were very lightly sewn and there"
-1,My favorite colors are purple and green  so when i was in the store and saw the beautiful purple flowers on the top of this blouse and all up and down the sleeves  i was was blown away. i was disappointed by the bottom of it  just huge  flowy  green fabric with no design on it whatsoever. i went with my first impression and bought it  but now that i'm trying it on in the house  i'm still bothered by the throw-away bottom of this blouse. i'm thinking this is just another retailer maternity t
1,I have several of goodhyouman shirts and i get so many compliments on them. especially the one that says forehead kisses are underrated. don't hesitate. buy this shirt. you won't be sorry.....
0,"I love the design and color of this cardigan  and the way it was styled in the store display made me snatch one up right away. but unfortunately  it's huge and shapeless (i tried size xs/s) and i'm a waif (5'2""  105#) - i think it could drape nicely on a tall woman but if you are small to average in height it'll hang down somewhere mid-thigh or even lower. you can snug up the ties  as they are threaded through the cardigan like a drawstring  but that just made it look bunchy and even more shapel"
1,I've been looking for a dress to wear to wedding this summer  and this is it. the blue color is lovely and the lace overlay is feminine and pretty. i'm small busted (34aa) with an athletic lower body (think  120-lb marathoner)  and the flare of this dress is perfect. i ordered this in a 0 and a 0 petite. the petite size looked little-girl short; the regular size hit just at my knee and was much more sophisticated. the waistband also fell at a more flattering place in the regular dress. i'm on th
-1,Just not as long as in the picture. it hit me at my hips not good!
0,Like others  i was drawn to the collar  fabric and overall look to it....  ________  pros:  - thicker fabric so it hides lumps and bumps well.  - collar is so classy  but i am drawn to anything with a collar.  - pockets are a nice touch.  _______  cons:  - thicker fabric and polyester = got hot rather quickly in it.  - runs a tad small if you have hips. there was only a medium at the store to try on and it fit everywhere but the hips; it just didn't flare out much for me being hourglass. a large
0,The jumpsuit is very pretty but it's definitely not meant for women who are on the curvier side or shorter. plus it sort of looks like pajamas on. i am 5'7 and i wanted to to look similar to the model in the picture but it comes down to my ankles so it would look best on taller/thin woman.
-1,This would be a great blouse for flat chested person. i am a size 12 and busty. i ordered an xl and it was ridiculously tight across the chest and the fabric is see through. you would need to wear a cami under it.
0,What a huge disappointment! i was really looking forward to wearing this top but it is very tight and awkward around the bust. if you have any semblance of a chest  this is not for you! i am a 38c and this was a no go. the quality of the top seems to be top notch but the fit was just no. it felt restrictive and it was hard to even move my arms and i have slender arms.
-1,"I totally agree with the last reviewer. i'm 5'2"" 115 pounds with somewhat wide shoulders. the x-small fit my torso but was so tight in my shoulders i couldn't move my arms. the small was better but was too big in the torso. the material itself was really nice. too bad the fit was so awkward and unflattering."
0,I loved the lavender color on the cape. it was soft and comfortable. but the design on the front ruined it for me. it took me all of 1 minute to know it was going back. it looked like florescent bird feathers nothing wrong with that  it just wasn't my style at all. i was a bit disappointed as it would have been perfect for cool ca nights. it looked more subdued in the photo  it's not. i clicked i would recommend to others as it is nicely made and i guess just not my taste as far as the colors an
-1,So unflattering! really disappointed. made me look 6 month pregnant and i'm a petite size 2.
1,"The fitted top and flared skirt are really nice on this piece. i am 5'6"" 125lb and i took a 6. a 4 might have been ok  but i felt more comfortable in the 6  and it had a really nice fit.    the quality is good  but there were some areas that were starting to pull and the floral details come a little frayed around the cutout edges  so i'm not sure how it will wear."
0,I wanted to love this top. the color is wonderful in the pink and the material is silky soft. it is huge though  i am a 34 dd and bought my usual small! i am going to exchange for an xs and am hoping it fits.
1,"Got charlie trousers last year in a different print in my usual size 4 (5'2""  115#). they initially fit perfectly but stretched out in the thighs and waist and now are loose.  this time i bought a size smaller (size 2). they were snug but i felt them stretch during the first wear and they fit fine now.  i recommend sizing down because they stretch out. love the print for summer (i love anything beachy) and had to have it!  nice comfortable material which isn't hot for summer.  got the regular si"
-1,I really wanted to love this dress  but it just didn't fit in anyway. i ordered an xs petite  and it was very large. the lacing in the back is completely useless  and that's what i liked about the dress. i was thinking it would be unlaced more at the top (because of chest) and then lace more tightly near the waist. it was completely closed off and the dress was still very loose and unflattering. beautiful fabric  great color combo  bad fit.
0,Wanted to love these pants  they are way  way  too long (i'm 5'4 128lbs for reference). i didn't love the way they looked cuff and didn't think it was worth having them hemmed. loved the color. would work well for someone tall and slim.
1,Another reviewer mentioned this was maternity-ish. i am currently almost 5 months pregnant  and i have to say: this is a wonderful maternity dress  even if that's not what it was made for. when not pregnant  i think this might have been a little overwhelming (and i guess we'll see next year if that's the case for me) -- there is a lot of fabric here. i am usually a small or medium in antrho dresses  and i am wearing a small in this now with room to grow as my stomach grows. the colors on the blu
0,Nicely made  pretty details  but it's cropped fairly short and is rather boxy. wore with orange linen pants and it was cute!
-1,I had my eye on this one for awhile and decided to buy it when it popped back on my wishlist. i can see why someone returned it. the sweater top hits at the worst possible spot and made me look ridiculous  like a mushroom top. from the side i saw the potential  but not enough to save it. probably one of the worst things i have ever purchased from retailer.
-1,I was so excited to get this dress  and it was such a disappointment! it looks so cute on the model  but it was very different when i got it. the color is a lot more yellow than i thought it would be  and the pattern just looked a bit strange--it stood out more against the yellow instead of looking neutral. the dress fit really awkwardly on the top. the straps were way too long  and the chest area was practically baggy when i put it on. i normally wear a 4p  and i ordered down to a 2p. the waist
0,I liked the idea of the diagonal color block but the fit of this tee was odd on me.  too tight around arms and way big and boxy around the mid-section.  going back.
-1,I bought this shirt after reading so many positive reviews. it looks much thinner and cheaper than the photo depicts.  like many reviewers have said  it does hit just above midriff but the fringe covers your belly.  it didn&#39;t hang right on me and i felt like i was wearing a rug.
1,A really beautiful  well made dress. runs extremely big though! i'm not petite by any means and ordered a large but i'm positively swimming in it. an oversized look works for this particular dress  but i think it's supposed to be more fitted so i would recommend sizing down from what you might normally expect for a piece of this style.
1,"I love a good gaucho/ culotte. these are very comfortable and fit is tts (i'm 5'9"" 145 and wear a 29). they are ironed with a line down the front  which i don't like  as it's always hard for me to keep the ironing straight. the pants have a little bit of stretch to them which is nice. since they're linen  they will require frequent ironing (which  i hate to do in the summer)."
-1,As much as i wanted to love this top  it was too flowy and and i felt like i looked bigger than i am (i'm a size 6). maybe a smaller size would have made a big difference.
1,"I'm glad they put up some pix of non-models looking cute in this dress  as it's taken a beating in the reviews! i measure 34(a)-27-35 and have no problems with the size s fit at all. it's drapey but not voluminous  with no pulling at the hips. the ""folded"" detail up at the top does call attention to the shoulders  but not in a bad way. the pleated neckline is cute on a small chest  and the red pattern/palette is awesome. love the length too -- i am 5'4"" & the size s hits me just above the knee."
-1,I finally found this dress in store today and wow! i cannot believe this cheap looking dress is from ms! they have been among the top at retailer and this unlined  baggy  cheap velvet sub is a shock! what happened? only the color is nice. please get back to yourself ms!
0,This is a cute top but the fit is problematic. it runs small on top especially around the bust and sleeves but then it flares below the waist in a billowy and unflattering way with way too much fabric.  i got both an xsp and an xxsp. the xxsp fit better on bottom but i could hardly pull my arms through the sleeves. both are going back unfortunately. for reference i'm 5' 103 lbs 32b.

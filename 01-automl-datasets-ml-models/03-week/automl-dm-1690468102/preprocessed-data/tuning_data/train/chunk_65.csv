1,Love this t-shirt. the weight is great for the impending heat and humidity of summer. it looks positively fabulous for casual occasions with pilcro chinos in moss and fuchsia suede pumps.
1,I held my breath as i slid this on for the first time right out of the package; the size 8 was perfect for me (usual medium  size 8  short-waisted  34f)! this blouse is truly a find: luxurious linen in a unique  appealing design  excellent fit (the pleat at the back gives nice room to make the fit just right  the v-neck is not too deep (thankfully bra friendly!)  the slightly lower back length is stylish but not extreme  and finally  admirable craftsmanship. i highly recommend! this will feel di
1,Very nice polka-dot pattern. i so think it is versatile and can go with a lot of different colors. i am worn it was different colors underneath and both a skirt and jeans. it is a timeless classic!!
-1,A beautiful sweater and very flattering on.  the stock photos do not do it justice.  but  i had to give it only 2 stars because it was so itchy that i couldn't even keep it on in the dressing room for more than a minute.
-1,So i have had to return this once so far because the stitching ripped out when i sat down. the little slip thing that goes underneath if cheaply made. i really wish this were just lined dress. i wear it with a blank tank top and leggings underneath. not worth the money  but i needed something to wear that was transitional.
1,Very versatile dress.  runs a bit large i am 5 foot 2 (105 lbs) and ordered the xs petite and it fit perfectly!
0,I tried this jacket on and it was definitely cute but a couple things to note. it's a wool acrylic blend and it was already starting to pill from being tried on in the store. also  it's unlined. i thought the price point was high given its fibers and unlined. given its hem  i wonder how much longevity the piece has and how quickly it might start to look dated too.
0,Love the color and style  but material snags easily
1,I never buy shorter shorts  my legs are so muscular that most are unflattering  but these were actually ok. they didn't look loose like the model  but hit a nice spot on the leg  and they have enough stretch to fit me nicely. i even bought the white color... unheard of! i weigh 115 lbs  all legs...
-1,My husband never has anything negative to say about my clothes until i wore these pants! they are not flattering and kept stretching out until i could pull them off without unzipping them! baggy in the behind and sloppy looking. they are going back asap!
0,"5'7""  34c  28 jeans  size 4 dress. fell in love with the pattern in particular  knowing the design might not work best for my body. ordered the size small - it was not unflattering - but it did nothing for my body type. if anything  the excess fabric made me appear wider and made my waist non-existent. the trouble was that the skirt portion has the elastic band starting high - approximately right under your chest - almost like an empire waist (this is hidden by the flap of material hanging over"
1,"I was hesitant to buy this dress with all the reviews regarding poor fit  particularly in the bust area  but it's so unique that i decided to give it a try anyway by ordering a petite size. i was pleasantly surprised to find that it fits beautifully in my usual size. i did not find the bust to be small at all  and the overall fit was very slimming and flattering. for reference  i am 5'2"" 110lbs 32dd  and the size 2p looks great and is very comfortable.  the 0p might have worked too. the material"
-1,I really wanted to love this  but it was just too voluminous to be flattering. i am typically a size 10 or 12 in dresses and jumpsuits  and the medium was billowing around me. also the elastic waist hit me low and bunched in an unflattering way. it had to go back.
-1,Really cute suit but way too small up top. not enough coverage under arms and across bust.i wish retailerpolgie carried bathing suits in the stores so they can be tried on. this is the 2nd suit i have ordered that had to be returned. i wont order a bathing suit again as its just to much of a risk.
0,This dress has way too much material. the material is really soft and beautiful but there's too much of it. it feels like you're wearing a big sack. sadly i'll be returning it.
1,Great dress with just the right amount of movement and flow everywhere. perfect to dress up for a night out or wear it casually during the day
1,This does run a little large  but it's light and flattering for me. the material is a very light/thin chambray  but it's also lined.
0,After eyeing this product online for awhile  i was able to try it on in store. i'm so glad i did  because while this dress is lovely  it is clearly not designed for my body type. i have a small rib cage and a large bust (32h ) which is i think what caused the keyhole to be so gaping on me. additionally  the straps of the dress were up by my neckline instead of lying properly on my shoulders  which was unflattering and left my bra straps clearly visible. the fabric was gorgeous and soft  and the
1,If you happen to get a size that fits you  you will love these leggings. they are true to size when the quality control works. i got 2 pair  both in size 28 - one fits perfectly and the other fits like my mothers high waisted jeans! the material is very soft and comfortable. also  not sure who named these colors  but the grey is really light purple and the dark grey is dark purple.
-1,I love sundry and their fun designs--i was disappointed because the fabric is very thin and the dark part of the heart is not black but bluish slate grey. it is just not what i expected from the picture. i bought the xs and it felt baggy on the body.
0,I do think this blazer is comfortable and looks decently cute  but wasn't sure about the fabric. hte coloring is fun too. i decided to pass on it only because of the previous review regarding shedding.
1,I love these  but i should have ordered the size 25 instead of my usual 26. i can wear them higher with a tight belt  but they are still too long. too cute to return though.
0,Love pilcro  love the stripes and the length - but this particular pair of capris/crops are super tight fitting. i went up a size from my usual and still felt tight. i guess its just the cut/fabric combo. i wanted it to be a slightly less form fitting feel ...... may work for you  however!
1,This top is so soft and comfortable. i bought it on sale  so would i have paid $60 for it . . . . not sure. fits true to size  what can i say its a simple top  well made and so soft.
1,"I bought this top about 3 weeks ago& love it! i like it because it's better than a plain t-shirt so it's perfect for running around doing errands or shopping. i like the material and the length  i'm 5'8"" and sometimes i feel like shirts are to short. i wash it and hang it to dry  no shrinking or pilling so far! i am ordering this in at least two more colors!"
-1,I so wanted to love this suit. it was gorgeous - the color  the quality  the style  but i am returning and can not recommend it. the sides need to be connected just a little bit higher and i think it would work  but there is no way you could move around in this without things popping out in front. i mean it would be gorgeous to just lay there in the sun  but i didn't feel like i could even walk safely  and i am not well-endowed. very bummed but it's going back.
0,This style of shirtdress usually fits me perfectly  however  this did not fit me one bit. the waist was too large  the length too short  and the hips too small. i was really hoping this would fit  since it's a unique color and the material is substantial but soft. i will be returning this.
1,I get so many compliments every time i wear this dress. friends  strangers  younger  older and even the pharmacist at my drugstore wanted to know where i bought the dress. it has a 70's vibe to it  fun and swingy. perfect for fall in florida with sandals or when it gets cooler  i think it will look great with leggings and boots. i purchased the orange and dark gray in a medium petite (i'm 5'4' and 135) and it hit just above my knee. my favorite dress right now!
-1,I originally got these in a 29 petite and thought they fit great right out of the bag (i'm usually a 6/8).. and within an hour of wearing them (to retailer  actually)  the knees had gotten so baggy that they looked absolutely ridiculous; i've never had jeans do this. the salesperson at retailer agreed that they seemed very odd. i exchanged for a 28p at her suggestion  and i just hate them. i'd say the smaller size seems every so slightly small  but nothing major - but the waist actually folds over a
1,These bottoms are comfortable  soft and fit perfectly. the pattern is exactly the colors online.
-1,This dress is huge. i am normally a l-xl regular in retailer brands. i love a loose  flowy dress. after trying one on in the store (just a random returned petite xl) i ordered the petite medium. and it was still huge and not flattering. so sad. i wanted to love this- loved the material and colors  but way off.
1,"I have loved ag stevie ankle denim for awhile now and have never been disappointed with the fit or quality. this pair is no exception to that. i am 5'5"" and about 113  slender with athletic thighs and the 26 fit great. buying them on-line  i wasn't able to check how distressed the denim was. the pair i received in the mail was indeed slightly different in the distressed locations from the on-line image. mine had no distressing on the upper thigh and one medium and one small spot on each leg. onl"
0,I really liked these jeans initially  but by the end of the day the waist is really baggy. the fabric stretches with wear and takes a wash to get back to its original shape.
-1,While i love the design and shape of this blouse  the fabric was of very poor quality. i will return it.
0,"I bought the blue dress  though the ""blue"" dress was a little more like grey according to my husband and i. the quality of the fabric was quite nice.    i have to return the dress because it does not fit me around the bust. i consider myself to have a good size bust (not huge)  but the dress seems to expect quite a bit smaller.     i was initially attracted to the dress because it looked a little more casual  which is what i wanted  but i guess i just wouldn't call it at all pretty."
-1,Could not wait for this to come and so disappointed.  first of all  it's not a happy orange  it a darker rust.  second  it is huge.  fits in the shoulders and is super comfy and cute but would be a dynamite maternity top.  you could go to term in this blouse!  back it goes.  so sad.
-1,I loved the criss cross part of this tank. however  it looked so frumpy on. the cut was just odd and if you are petite it felt like a tent. i was so bummed because that criss cross was awesome but it just looked so weird on. i returned it. the material felt nice too.
-1,This top is has an awkward neckline  doesn't lay like the photo (as mentioned by another reviewer.) see threw  and of poor quality. the fit is very baggy and unflattering. and material is very thin. it also runs very large!! the color is pretty  but that is it :(
1,"I ordered size small. i am 5' 6""  32 b. the fabric is super soft and the fit is great. there's an adorable little quote on the pantie's lining  and the bra has a beautiful print on its inner lining. the feel of the lace and fabric is divine. love it! one more thing to note...there is very little lining in the bra; really nothing more than an extra layer of fabric. it is enough to protect modesty  but not much else."
1,I saw this online and thought it was so pretty--so i ordered a large even though i'm usually a medium in retailer shirts. i thought i might need the extra room to layer. i was in the store returning something and they had a medium and a large so i tried both and the large was way too big in my shoulders and chest even with a sweater! the medium was a little tight in my hips-but still fit. overall the medium was more flattering on me. so i recommend ordering your regular size. it is such a pretty v
-1,Good quality fabric and structure but the mix media details and lines make them seem more like jodphurs than leggings. it's hard to see where i would wear them ... sorry but they have to go back.
0,I ordered online and wear xs- m. i ordered a small but it seems big. i have to drive 1+ hour to a store so i do a lot of online ordering. i'm thinking of returning for smaller size. may make a road trip- have several items to return! i hate paying shipping to buy and shipping to return if it doesn't work!
1,Beautiful and very versatile dress. extremely forgiving for post baby bodies  while stylish and classy.
0,So  this is just the most lovely romper. beautifully made  flowey. very comfortable  until you have to take it off.  this is the review i posted on facebook.   so  no man i know has ever ever ever experienced the abject terror  or maybe has not shared with me  that moment when you cannot get out of  because it has turned into a straight jacket  that otherwise cute romper. and again  maybe a man invented it!
-1,If i stopped eating for a couple of months or jumped into a time machine and set the dial for 1990 i would really enjoy this beautifully made delicate blouse. the problem area is evident looking at the photo --the tiny tight fitted gorgeous bodice. i will keep this piece becasue i love it so and the apocolypse is apparently imminent and i have hardly any food in the house.
0,"I was on the fence about this dress because even on the model  it's a little bit frumpy  but it was so pretty that i tried it. however  on my short frame  it's even frumpier. the quality is very good  the fabric is soft and it's lined. the pattern is really pretty and delicate and i wish it was more flattering. i think the only way this dress will look good is if you are quite tall and thin. i am 5'4""  110 lbs with large-ish hips and i ordered a 2p  but even the petite was too saggy. i needed a"
0,I wanted to love this dress. i've been looking for a cute  flattering red dress for ages and snapped this up on sale online  thinking it was finally the one. when i tried it on i found the shape flattering  even to my recently pregnant figure. other than that  i was highly disappointed for two reasons. one  quality issues  as mentioned by a previous reviewer - the slip is sewn in totally unevenly  resulting in it sticking up above the neckline on one side  with several threads poking up above th
-1,This is a great top but it is really big. i have a similar top from the same brand and the size small fits as expected. this top is easily 2 inches wider everywhere. i would love to exchange it for an extra small  but am afraid that even that size would be too large. the blue pattern is beautiful and the fabric is light and airy  which is perfect for warm days  but the size issue is out of control!
1,You have to try it on to see  it fits really well and looks stylish. i love it.  my only concern is the fabric is rather stretchy  not sure if it will hold up well in the long run.
-1,I drooled over this dress online  so couldn't pass up trying it on at my local retailer store. while i loved the unique color in person  & the drape of the skirt (good quality  fully lines)  i was so disappointed with the top of this dress! it's very tight  ill-fitting  & just plain...weird. i can't imagine the fit of the top being flattering on anyone  regardless of chest size. it's a shame  because otherwise  the dress is adorable!
0,I really love this top  but am afraid i may need to return it  because the fabric is so delicate that little snags began to show up within hours of wearing it  and they show really badly as black spots  because the fabric is made with light and dark delicate threads. it feels so good on though! you must be super careful with it. i have no idea how the little snags even got there!
0,I had read a few reviews on this shirt before ordering that said it ran small and was shorter than it looks. i thought it was worth finding out because i really liked how this shirt looks in the pictures on the store site. unfortunately  when i got it in the mail and opened it up i found out that all the earlier review were right.    it is much shorter than the dimensions implied in the pictures of the model. i was expecting a tunic style shirt that could be worn over leggings or skinny jeans th
-1,I ordered the in the emerald green and it was sent to me with a dime size hole in the sleeve. i am very disappointed  because i love the sweater. by the time it arrived  it was sold out in my size. now  i cannot exchange it for one that is not damaged. if the sweater was not damaged  i would recommend this product.
1,The sweater is thinner than i expected but very cute so i'm keeping it. it seems well made so i'm not expecting easy snags  it washed well.
0,Love this  but the one thing that made me buy this is that if you look at the pic  the girl has her hand in a pocket - there is no pocket!!! which makes me bring the rating down - some one else had noted that the v is deep - they are very right - be prepared to shift the shirt lots unless you wear something under....... it is- other than that i really like it
1,I thought these were pretty on the website  but in person they look like a work of art! the colors are vivid -- bright reds  pinks  greens  blues  yellow -- with flora  fauna  houses  writing  type and so many other things on a white and cream background. they are very soft  medium-weight flannel. for me they run true to size. i wish they had pockets  though!
0,I wear an 8-10 and these are a little big on me  which is surprising. they also don't lay really flat in the back. the pockets are inside in the back  in side two layers  and don't lay very flat. the crotch is low and rides up when i walk.  i'll probably wear them again  but i'm not totally thrilled by them.
0,The design is cute  but there is way too much fabric in the lower part of the shirt. also  the fabric for the lower part crumples easily. unless you carry around an iron  you may not want to wear it outside the house. i kept the shirt to wear around the house.
0,This dress is very good quality  with beautiful beading on the bodice. it's a heavier material than i was expecting  but that was a pleasant surprise. unfortunately  when i put it on and looked in the mirror  i laughed out loud because i looked like a fancy swiss milkmaid. the shoulders are puffier than shown on the model and  combined with the overall design and length  i couldn't think of anywhere to wear it. this is an easy return for me. the dress runs very true to size and the bodice is fit
1,I've only worn the sweater a handful of times  but i'm already in love with how soft and comfortable it is. it's a bit on the baggier side  but that doesn't stop it from looking great. i've gotten complements on it every time i've worn it. i would highly recommend it to people who don't like the typical scratchy/itchy textiles.
-1,"I bought the xs regular and it was a little too long and wide. i was unable to find a petite version in the store or online. the ruffles were also bigger than how they appear on the model. i am 5'1"" tall and weigh 110 lbs. i believe the petite would have been a much better fit. i regret not discovering this top sooner when more size options were available."
0,Very nice top  like the linen fabric. i ordered my regular size m and its huge. makes me look larger than i am  and i will be returning it. i would like a size s i think  just not a flattering oversize fit for me
0,"I tried these on because the color is really pretty and fun  and who donse't want a pair of comfy/cute pants... but they looked awful on my muscular thighs... i don't think the cut will be falttering on 99% of the population. also  not as comfortable as they looked  the crotch seemed a little ""low"" on me  though the pants were in the correct size."
0,The sweater is cute  but scratchy.
-1,Based on the other reviews  i sized down from my usual 6p to a 2p  but this dress was still ridiculously huge and extremely unflattering. i could tell the minute i took it out of the package it wouldn't work. i can't imagine this would flatter very many people. the front photo of the model is incredibly deceptive. very disappointed--this will be going back for sure.
-1,When i saw this online  i wondered why this dress cost so much. i have been keeping my eye on it for some time. loved what i saw  the design and colors and details at the neckline and waist along with pockets but was skeptical. i was waiting for a sale to take a dive and here are my thoughts when i got it: ___________ pros: - the colors you see online are exactly the same in person. - the jeweled neckline is lovely. it's one thing that drew me to it. this dress had a very sophisticated appeal wh
1,I wear this top with jeans or cords. i allways get compliments. it's comfortable and versatile. go down a size!
-1,Generally  i find sizing at retailer to be very consistent  so i ordered this dress in the same size that i order all of my other retailer dresses. the bust was way to small. so i had to go and return this and have the next size up shipped to me. it's till way too small! in addition  the shipping was terrible - the dress was just dumped into a bag with no attempt to fold this  and the right strap was defective! it's so irritating that i have to return this again!
-1,I'm normally a small in retailer tops. i ordered a small  and the top fit well in the shoulders and in the upper (more fitted) part. it all went horribly wrong from there. the top billowed out at the bottom and fit like a circus tent  instantly adding a good 50 pounds to my frame. this was such a disappointment  as the pattern is beautiful and the fabric is high quality.
0,I love the look of this dress. the fitting could use some work--the top layer could be slightly more fitted--but overall it looks adorable. as other reviewers have mentioned the top does not have any button loops.     my biggest issue with the dress is the quality of the material. one time through the wash on the gentle cycle and the slip underneath has shrunk at least a full size. for the price of this dress  i don't expect disposable clothing. if i had known it would shrink  i would've hand wa
1,The picture is not a good depiction of what the skirt actually looks like. the colors are more varied and green is the dominant color. it looks great on and the colors compliment each other. i would definitely recommend it as a daily go to item for your wardrobe.

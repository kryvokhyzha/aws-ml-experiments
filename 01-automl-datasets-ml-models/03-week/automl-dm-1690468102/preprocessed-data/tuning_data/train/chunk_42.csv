1,Very fun and comfortable pants that will bring you many compliments. they do fall open when you sit down  though they have liner shorts inside for coverage. they are not appropriate for work but will become a wardrobe favorite.
-1,I loved everything about this dress. the fit  the style and the ability to wear in the fall. i wore it once  washed it in gentle/hand-wash cycle  in cold water and laid it out flat to dry- per the instructions- and it shrank at least a full size. it's going back. i am so sad  as i said earlier  i really loved this dress.
0,"I so wanted to love this dress! the fabric is gorgeous the styling beautiful and the construction is great - however  the armholes are cut too generously. i am 5'4""  138 pounds and 36d. i ordered the black in a size 10. it fit me perfectly everywhere but the armholes. even with an undergarment  too much is exposed. i am sadly returning this."
1,At the beginning of the season i lusted over an ivory haute couture side-sliced tunic so much that i almost sprang for the $800 price tag. when i saw this at retailer  i realized it was similar  but had certain design elements that made it even more unique than the other. i just received it  and i was not disappointed! that cable neckline is beautiful  the 3/4 sleeves are perfect to show off a bracelet or two  and whether worn with skinny jeans  as shown  or wide leg trousers (as the haute
0,I loved the look of this top when i saw it online  however  when i received it i was kinda disappointed. the color of the top was different than what i perceived initially. .it's way more off white. ..not my favorite. the texture/pattern of fabric on the body of the top was too near hanky for me. the sequin detail at neckline is wonderful  but not enough for me to keep. unfortunately i will be returning this one. not a hit for my desired as the tic but some one else might love!
-1,I really like both colors in this top. i love the way it lays  the length  the material  etc. what i don't like is that the arm holes are very large and shows the entire side of your bra. this is definitely a summer top so why would someone want to have to wear a cami when it's warm enough to go sleeveless? too bad  i would have bought it for sure.
0,Billowy top - perfect for casual comfort. the topic is definitely not raspberry-- it is a sunset orange. disappointed as i was going for a match. i should have gone off of the picture and not the color name.
1,This tops is super cute and great transitional shirt for the fall. a little short in the front but still a great shirt.
1,This dress is more adorable on then sitting on the hanger. the material clings to all the right places and feels really good. i must say this is one of the most comfortable dresses i have ever put on. would never tell from the photo that this dress is so adorable. if you like a fitted dress in the waist and bust that subtly accentuates your curves - try it. adorable!
-1,Uhm no. oh dear  no. i was initially drawn to this blouse's lovely fabric  the color and pattern are truly stunning. i decided to give it a try because it seemed somewhat boxy  oh boy was i right. sadly  this is one of the least flattering tops that i've ever tried on at retailer. it might be a great maternity top  though.
0,I was so disappointed when i received this top. the color is some washed-out faded version of the picture shown and the cut is much fuller than it looks in the picture. the back is cute but not worth the awful  drab actual color.
-1,This cardigan looked great on line but it is one of the worst things i ever ordered at retailer. the quality is awful and the material feels flimsy and cheap.
0,This blouse runs large  billows out slightly  and hangs in a boxy straight way. i'm normally a medium but can probably wear a small in this blouse. the blouse is lined with a light-weight material but i can still see through it just a little bit. although very pretty  the blouse can snag easily so be careful when wearing. regardless  i plan to return for a small because this blouse is beautiful and unique. perfect for fall with its warm colors or summer because it's light weight.
0,I love the colors in this top  but sadly i'm going to have to return it. the first thing my husband did when he saw this on me was just stare  and not in a good way. then he said it looked like a maternity top. i was so disappointed  and sadly will be returning this. for reference  i am 135 pounds. 5-ft. 4-in tall and do not want to look pregnant in a top. i normally wear size medium tops  but this one is huge. now i know why the model in the picture had her arms nestled in at her sides. this to
0,The regular length i tried on in store definitely didn't work for me. for reference in the photos i have a medium on and my measurements are 38-30-40.
1,This dress is casual enough to throw on as a cover up and dressy enough for a night out. it so comfy and versatile. will never go out of style. it does run large  but that is just the style of the dress. it really is the perfect summer dress.
0,I ordered this online in the cream color and because some of the reviews mentioned the shorter back  i went with a medium  but that ended up running too big. i typically wear between a 4 and a 6 / small and medium so i'm always on the fence about which size to get. i often order both online and return the one that doesn't fit as well  so i wish i had this time too! the detail on the front is super cute and i didn't even mind the plainer back  but the sleeves went well past my wrist and i felt li
1,I purchased the medium in this sweater as that was all that was left. but it fit like a large if not an xlarge! it's a beautifully made sweater and really soft. i now think i know why it suddenly becomes available again here and there. it's not the kind of sweater you want to wear over sized because as beautifully made as it is  it's not that flattering if it's hanging on you. luckily it suddenly became available in a small which i quickly ordered and will keep my figures crossed that it's bette
1,"The picture of this dress does not do the colors justice. they are a very rich green and pink  which were a popular color combination in the 70's. (i was there!) it adds an authentic touch to this great peasant dress. the black and white embroidery on the bib gives it a modern flair. i am 5'6""  130 pounds  and usually wear a size six in a dress. the small fit perfect. while the dress is billowy  the square on the back pulls it in  so it doesn't fit like a tent. perfect for boots now  sandals lat"
1,"I was able to purchase this on sale and i'm so glad i did. i usually go between a size s and m (133 lbs.  5' 5""  34 d) but the small fits perfectly. the color really isn't dark orange as stated......kind of a cross between rose/pale red/ salmon but i really love the color. it's not super heavy weight but not really thin either....actually perfect!"
1,I completely disagree with the previous review. i purchased this dress and i absolutely love it! i went out for a couple occasions (one being special and the other not so special) and both times i received compliments all night! my husband loves it and that really says a lot. i feel the dress runs true to size  and the quality is right where it should be... runway worthy... absolutely!.... worth $3000's + ?....probably not  but i personally can't afford that anyway. i'm so happy to have found th
1,This is a basic henley  and it is made well; a wardrobe staple  for sure. the cut is flattering  and the material is soft. i ordered the small  which is tight fitting. i'm a 34 c for reference.
0,This dress is really cute in person. however  it did not fit me like it does the model in the pic at all. first of all i'm 5 feet 1 and it was wayyy too short on me. i didn't have the petit on either-- i had the regular xs. it just hits a couple of inches too short for me. i am 50. it would be adorable if i were more comfortable in shorter dresses. i wear short things a lot  but this was just too high on me. it was probably a good 8 inches above my knee. also it flared too dramatically at the wa
-1,"My perspective is as a sewer so i'm more picky perhaps. this top is poorly made. the fabric pattern is crooked or not consistent in each piece. sewers do this to save $ - squeezing the pieces on the fabric. it looks sloppy. the cut is very full; the bottom edge measures 104"" around. for my figure  curvey  at 5'6"" and 150lbs  this top is not flattering it looks maternity. perhaps best on a slim figure and with leggings."
-1,The top i received was large  really long in length  pockets in the front along the seam  and lots of volume in the back without any princess seams to give it shape. the id #'s matched  but that's about it. returned!
-1,I had such high hopes for this blouse  as it looks totally stunning online. however  it's not as pictured/described in that it is totally sheer and the brand is not floreat  but rather hd in paris. for the price  the quality is just not there...i've seen comparable shirts at other stores for much less. i returned it without a second thought.
1,This top is super comfy and easy to wear. i found it to be a bit darker tan than it looks online  but still quite cute. it's flowy but still gives you shape  overall it was a great buy.
1,These tight cords are perfect for fall.
0,"I bought this sweater online as soon as i saw it. but like the other reviewers i agree it is shapeless and sticks out too much at and below the waist. if it were a softer fabric maybe the flair would work but not for this one. i am 5' 2""  115lbs  32d and got the xs. maybe if you aren't chesty it won't flare out as much. sadly i had to return it. i was so excited for it  o well."
0,Love this blouse  however upon every time i wear it  a new button pops off. i have had to replace every button!
0,I really like the idea behind this top  but at least for me  the execution wasn't quite there. i was hoping it would be something i could wear to work  but the sheerness of the sides makes it in appropriate for my workplace (when it gaps/you move  you can see a lot). if you don't move  the front panel is pretty opaque  which is good. i think it would look odd with a cami underneath and i don't feel comfortable with the sheerness  so i returned it. i also thought the finish on the sleeves looked
-1,The buttons on the back are very tedious. you will need someone to help you. if you get past that hurdle  then you have the look of a little girl in a smock. way too big. like a nightgown. nice quality  but not practical.
-1,Although i love retailer  this product isn't the quality or presentation i expect from them. the dress arrived stuffed into a small plastic bag and was a crumpled mess. the fabric wasn't soft and fluid as i expected  but rather was stiff and a little scratchy. i purchased the ecru version  which was also slightly darker than the photo showed. i returned the dress and will keep looking.
1,This is great soft sweater that is not to bulky looking.sometimes when you have a design like this it looks good off but when you put it on it makes you look like a stuffed marshmallow. this sweater's knit is thin enough that when you add the accents it looks less bulky. wore it with winter white pants and received many compliments.
1,I would have bought this had it not been for the way the pockets are sewn in. they are attached on the inside by a string. if the string broke the pockets would dangle. for the price you would think they would have sewn pockets in to the vest. too bad.
1,I feel like i have a lot of blouses like this so it really needed to wow me to keep it. and while it is lovely  well made and very pretty and delicate...i just didn't feel like it was anything special. if you don't have a blouse like this  then it is a great find. but it is nothing super out of the ordinary... fit i feel is tts...i am in between a m and l...i ordered the l. lots of room in the body although i didn't like where the arms hit on me. they aren't wrist length but they aren't mid-fore
-1,I love the ethnic colors & the creative woven design of this garment. that's what attracted me in the first place. however  some of the metallic threads had snagged & i thought the loose weave & acrylic yarns would lead to more snags & it would eventually stretch out of shape. also  it's very big. too bad it doesn't come smaller. in the online picture  it must have been gathered & clipped behind the model because it really doesn't fit close like that & the long armholes are not visible online as
-1,The colors on this kimono are amazing and i really loved it  however  i too noticed the 'delicateness' of the material. it is so delicate that parts were starting to fray - including next to the kimono's label. so sad.
-1,The print and front ruffle are beautiful. the sleeves are awful and poorly represented in the picture of the model. it's almost like the sleeves have a life of their own - so mismatched with this style of blouse. such a beautiful print but so disappointing in shape.
0,"I hoped  from the picture  that this would be more of a ""straight down"" sort of fit. retailer is usually really great at selling tops that flatter hips without having an obvious bell shape to them. however  the top had too much of a ""flare out"" bell-shaped vibe. i need to be able to wear this with maxi skirts in the summer  but this top would be too sack-like and billowy with those. i think it would only work with jeans/trousers. my final objection was the arm holes - the way they are cut "
1,This sweater is beautifully detailed  however  it seems too spring like to be for sale before christmas. very pretty. the cut may not be for everyone. it is like a peplum on the bottom and looks best open  as shown  on my busty top (36d) it seems cut slightly large but i am keeping my usual size medium. i'll keep for early spring! colors are as shown  detail better in person.
1,These are so comfortable  it's like wearing jammies outside. i love the pattern and you really can't be the comfort.
0,Love the design and the gold color  but the seams between knit and lace were a little weird and bunched/weren't smooth. maybe the one i tried on just needed to be ironed or something...
0,This dress is lovely (albeit darker than it appears on the website)  but i had to return. it runs way small?i usually comfortably where an l or xl in maeve (this brand)  and could not even get this l on. would really only recommend for xs or s ladies (maybe m) who have the possibility of going larger. if you do purchase  absolutely size up 1-2 sizes.
1,"I am 5'3""  118 lbs and fit perfect in size s petite. good material and flatting!"
0,Though the quality is good and the fabric is both sturdy and soft  the cut of this top made this a no-go for me. it's a bit short in front and also boxy  which is emphasized by the dolman sleeves. i ordered the coral color and it was much brighter - almost neon-y - as opposed to the soft salmon color my screen shows. i regretfully returned it.
0,I really wanted to love this dress. i thought i might be able to dress it up for a wedding i'm attending  but it was kind of a serious no go. first off  i ordered a petite size  but it was still longer than on the model--i'm 5'5'  so not even technically petite  but i thought it might be a better length for me that way. it was not a great length  and the pleats and pockets (which would be great in theory) make the skirt fully (and pouffier at the waist) than i would have liked. i love the way th
0,This coat is absolutely beautiful - an instant stunner. the style is very classy and timeless. it is definitely more of a lightweight coat than true cold weather wear. yes  it does run large  but that is the cozy look of it. it is not meant to be form-fitting. my one gripe is that - especially at the price point - if it's not going to be especially warm  it should at least be otherwise functional. the coat i received has pockets cut on the outside  but they are sewn shut. a coat without pockets?
-1,I know we've gotten to the point that polyester can be acceptable  but sometimes it's still that horrible texture  unbreathable mess. unfortunately  that's what this top is made out of. so it runs big  its billowy  and cute  but i couldn't get it off quick enough because of the feel of the fabric.
1,I saw the orange/tangerine colored version of this sweater and loved it. it looked beautiful on top. the chiffon material at the bottom of the sweater is a lovely detail. sadly  the bottom portion of the sweater made my hips look huge and i felt i looked pregnant. i weigh 111lbs. i am petite and small boned. i think it was because i am short waisted that this style did not suit me. i wish i could look good in this! it is absolutely exquisite in color and texture.
-1,This is a beautiful sweater with deep rich colors. i purchased the blue motif. the problem is that the model(s) are small busted  which allows the side panels and front panel to lay nicely and swing in a flattering manner. i am 5'6''  135 pounds and a 36d. i usually wear a small in antro tops. i purchased this online  and was excited upon it's arrival. when i tried it on  i was horrified. it looked like a babydoll maternity sweater on me. the front did not lay well (flat) at all from the chest d
1,In love with this blouse  i first got in ivory went back and got in black  you can dress casual or up.
0,I wanted to love these pants  but they were larger than i expected and the fabric is very heavy. almost like a thick sweater.
-1,I ordered this dress in a size 8  my normal size at retailer. it is a lovely dress and so feminine  but it is incorrectly sized. i couldn't begin to button it. i reordered it in size 12 if that tells you anything. buyer beware. unless you are itsy bitsy  you need to size up. i will say that as pretty as the photos are  the dress is even more lovely in person.
-1,I loved this shirt and attempted to buy it - however the armhole is so small i couldn't barely get the shirt off and almost had to call someone into the dressing room to pull it off of me. i'm usually a 6 and i tried on the 6 and 8  and both shirts had the same problem. it wasn't exactly the sleeve that was too tight  but the arm hole that was not big enough. it pulled across the top of my chest and was not roomy enough to slip in and out of. which was odd because the rest of shirt was fine. i d
-1,I was surprised by the other reviews. expected to live in this all winter but found the style bulky and awkward. the hi-low cut with so much bulk just wasn't flattering. i wish the armholes had been larger so that the body of the shirt would have fallen closer to my body. the armholes are the size of a fitted shirt which pulls the shirt wide rather than allowing it to drape a bit more. it is incredibly soft but just not as comfortable as i'd hoped. it went back.
1,"I purchased this dress in my normal small size - via online. i exchanged it it for a medium in the store as the shoulders were just a little too tight for me. i plan on wear it with tights/leggings as it's a little to short on my 5'9"" frame. well made and the bodice has so much detail but not over the top."
1,I absolutely love this shawl/jacket! i usually use it as outerwear and it is the perfect piece for those in between weather days in new england when it's too cold for winter wear and not warm enough to go without a jacket. the black/brown works great with whatever you're wearing. so versatile and i love that it has pockets!
-1,"I'm 5'-4""  130lbs with a 32f chest. this dress looked like a cross between little house on the prairie and a mu mu. i can't imagine this looking good on anyone who isn't 7' tall. also  the straight across  rather high neck line wasn't flattering to a large chest and then the arm holes are huge. the fabric was a bit shiny and felt cheap. it wasn't see through but it had the feel of a nightgown  not a hundred dollar dress."
-1,I was really excited for this top to arrive and was really disappointed once i tried it on. i am sure this is a gorgeous top on someone with a straighter or more slender frame. it is good quality and looks fine on the hanger. i think the color in the picture online accurately shows the color. ladies with hips or a booty  beware...this looked horrible on me! it clung to my butt and didn't hang nice and straight like it does in this picture. i expected the fabric to have a little give to it but it
0,"I am 5' 8""  145 pounds with a 32 ddd bust. i typically purchase a small or a 4 to 6 in blouses. this blouse was small across the chest and therefore  i purchased a size 8. it is a nice fit. however  the button placement on the blouse does not work well for someone who is chesty. one button is placed slightly above bust line and the other slightly below. this causes a peek-a-boo space between buttons. therefore  i wear a bright white tank top beneath the blouse and wear the blouse unbuttoned to j"
0,This dress is super cute - and fits tts for retailer. i ordered my usual size small and it fit me great everywhere  however the arms are much shorter and hit me either wrong  or the model in the picture is just very very small. i'm 5'10  136#  36aa  slim built and the dress fits  but the arms bunch up -- if i ordered a medium the entire dress would be too baggy (and it is a loose fitting shift). bummer  bc it is super cute! also  the material is loose crochet - my dress arrived with a pull. sad fa
1,"Now that i have this dress in my life i think my wardrobe is done.  there is nothing but love for this dress as it hits all the correct points:  great fit  flattering silhouette  comfortable fabric  shape enhancing cut  and the easiest casual style ever!  i got the 10p and my body is 5'3"" 140# 36dd"
0,Loved this top  but had to return it. the collar is gorgeous but terrible quality
0,I'm a consistent size 6 (ordered a small) with a pretty athletic build (wide shoulders and strong arms) and this dress simply did not fit with those proportions. the sleeves and back were far too tight. additionally  the bow did not cover my bra strap  likely because it isn't made for someone my height. had to return.
0,"I really like this shirt but it's a bit maternity. i don't mind some extra fabric around the stomach area but there is a lot here. i'm 5' 7"" about 125 and i think it makes me look like i might be hiding a little secret. since i'm done having kids  it has to go back.   it's also somewhat see through and had i kept it  i would have worn a tank top underneath.  as long as these things don't bother you  it really is cute!"
-1,I&#39;m taller (5&#39;8)  so it&#39;s not uncommon for things to be too short on me  but this was really short for the style.  it was very wide and loose all over in my usual size - both up top and in the wavy part below.  the style really just did not work with the length.  it looked very odd.
-1,This is one fabulous-looking dress; however  the really scratchy neckline at the lace edge was a deal-breaker for me. i even tried sizing up  to see if that would help  but it was still too scratchy for me.
-1,I was so excited to receive this topped then i tried it on. i am a petite and i normally wear an xs so i ordered it in both a size 0 and a size 2. it was huge! it looked like i was wearing a potato sack!!! i really wanted it to work because the fabric is absolutely beautiful! i am so disappointed.
1,"I do love this dress. i wore it for my 20th anniversary party and received numerous compliments. it's great for embracing your curves. it has a wonderful ""vintage-made-modern"" flair that classic retailer pieces always have. you do have to be careful when wearing it...jewelry or belts may snag the intricate lacework. i am definitely the type of shopper who waits for a sale. this is one of the few pieces i felt i could splurge on. it is just that unique. i hope that retailer continues to carry these t"

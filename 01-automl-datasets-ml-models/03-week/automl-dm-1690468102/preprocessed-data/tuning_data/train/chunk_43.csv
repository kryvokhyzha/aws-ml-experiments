1,These jeans are beautiful. as the other reviewers have noted...they run very large...like 2 sizes  even then they are very stretchy. the embroidery is dark blue (looks black on screen)....lovely pair of jeans. if they had other colors i would by them!
0,"I am allergic to wool and have a hard time finding winter sweaters. was really excited when i read material content on this item only to be disappointed upon arrival to note that sweater is 10% wool. also found it to be very tight in arm area. for reference i am 5'10""  130 lbs. and would say have slender arms! cute design that will work for some!"
0,I received this in the mail and it looked beautiful but the zipper was broken just like one of the other reviews. normally i would just exchange but i don't know if it's worth getting another broken one.
0,The xxs petite fit great except in bust and shoulder area. i'm a 32a and it was really tight.
-1,It seemed to stay in place and did not require constant readjustment. however  i found the band to be extremely small and tight. it is not the most comfortable bra because of the way the band just presses into your skin.
-1,And this one proved to be no different. the short end of it; this dress is pretty much super thick  heavy linen with a rope like collar (the supposed embroidery you see)  and there is no lining  but completely unnecessary pockets. i'm typically a 2 or 4 depending on the designer (5'7 & a super fit 135 lbs) and knew enough to order an xs in this  however it still fit like a potato sack. even upon taking it out of the plastic bag  i knew it was going back. between the unrealistic pictures and lack
1,I tried this on at my local store and immediately had to buy it. the picture does not do it justice. it drapes wonderfully in front and sticks out a bit at the pockets to give some added personality. fabric is very soft and light weight. highly recommend!
0,Very orange. the slits in the back are larger than pictured and not at the cutest part of anyone's anatomy... shorter in front and i have a short torso. the fabric is nice and lightweight.
0,Just be prepared: this is huge! i looked hilarious in my normal 00p. this was in store  luckily  the the excellent personal stylist warned me. i also don't think the colors are as good in person - bit dull. if it fits you  it could be nice.
-1,"I was so excited for this dress.. but sadly it did not meet expectations. the gauze fabric already had several snags/pullers in it. the underslip was very short and just cleared my derriere.(i'm 5'7"") i normally take a 10/12 and ordered this in a l.. it was somewhat clingy in the hip area but yet bulky on top. also  i like to have the first button open  but you could then see the v neck of the underslip and it looked hokey. it's definitely a thicker material than the previous plaid tunic holding"
1,Cute and simple.  nice fabric. it's a looser fit so if you're in between sizes i'd recommend the smaller size
-1,I am a sucker for a peasant dress. i love anything i can toss with a pair flats and head out the door  but this dress is ridiculous. i look like a schoolmarm. the white bib collar takes this dress into costume territory. i love one september and have many items from the brand that i wear regularly  so i'm bummed that this wasn't what i expected. i knew it would have flow  but it's more billowy than i wanted. stay away unless you want to look like a little girl on the first day of school.
0,These pants are so adorable and fit perfectly (long enough even on my 5'10 frame) but i was forced to return because the white color is completely see through  even with nude panties. you can still clearly see them. so disappointed.
-1,The color and quality of this sweater are fantastic. the reason i only gave it two stars is that the height of the neck didn't seem right to me. it looked awkward and too high to be left standing upright  but when folded over i wished it were higher so it formed more of a turtleneck/cowl. i will be returning the sweater because of that.
0,"High quality  yummy soft fabric  gorgeous color. even with those three pros  this jumpsuit is not for me. i am 5'2"" and 150 lbs  size 10-12 m/l in the lines that retailer carries. i own one of their jumpers and it is very flattering! this one  however has capri pants  hits awkwardly at the midsection and makes my torso look even more square. on a tall  thin woman  it probably works!"
0,Pretty tank  embroidered flowers just as pictured. slightly see through so that a cami would be a must. for the price  should be more of a show stopper...unfortunately just average.
-1,I'm not sure if the top i received was damaged or if the design didn't consider gravity but this is not what i expected. i really want to like this top  but i don't see how i can wear it.
1,Love  love  love this dress! i needed a fun but not over the top dress for family pictures and this was perfect. great pop of color and looked amazing with over the knee boots. i see myself wearing this thru the holidays and will likely throw on with a jean jacket. i found it true to size - my normal size 4 fits me well. buy this dress - you won't regret it!
-1,I couldn't even figure out how to wear this sweater the fit was so odd. the arms cut off short and the seams don't hit your shoulders where they should. all the extra fabric around the collar is just confusing and unflattering. moving around in it was not easy. i will return this one!
1,As the previous reviewer mentioned  this dress is great for a dress that doesn't have a true waist. it really fits awesome. so incredibly soft  high quality material  and the mesh pockets are perfection (pockets that are so small/light that you can't tell the dress even had them when looking at it!). the color of the dress is what initially drew me to it (definitely a different color for a sun dress) and after trying it on in stores i would say 'beware.' though it truly is a rich and different c
1,Love these pants. very flattering. not much stretch. the rear waist band is elastic with minimal stretch and not visible to others. they are long but wearable with the right heels.
0,I thought i might like the look of this oversized odette dress but after i tried it on i felt it was not a flattering style on me. the color was pretty and fabric was nice - just not a fit for me.
0,I get that it's a swing style top and supposed to be loose but it looked so much bigger on me than on the model and just not flattering at all.
-1,This sweater is a dull off white color. it looks old fashioned. don't get.
1,"I love these pants. i vary between 10 & 12  the 10 fit perfectly since they are designed on the fuller size  perfect for my body type of small waist and a bit of bottom. so many colors to coordinate with these pants. teal green  ""retailer"" yellow  black...i am not fond of ankle pants  prefer longer pants. i took the cuffs down and lengthened the pants. the only problem is that these pants are so exquisitely made  removing the cuff tacks was a challenge! perfect pants for those of us who have shape"
0,I love the back detail but doesn't feel that comfortable on. i bought in green. it's fitted so get size larger if you plan to layer up. i'm 107 and bought xs size. i should have ordered the s.
0,I'm 5'8 128lbs and bought a size 2. i loved this dress  but didn't expect to have to go bra-less or wear a tube top under. the top lands much lower than i expected but the rest of the dress was lovely.     i ordered a size 2
-1,I am sorry to say this blouse is way below all retailer standards. this top should have been placed on sale a long time ago! poor quality in cut  fabric  design. this is a top one would grab at a local box store for 19.99. the colors are not as vibrant. the shoulders ill fitted. and the fabric and threads are very cheap. i was expecting so much more.sorry retailer.....my favorite store to shop!
-1,I splurged on this pajama set for myself and now regret it. even though the design is adorable  the fabric contains acrylic and the knitted fairisle part started pilling within the first week of wear. after a month and a couple washes  it looks horrible  and the fleece part is looking a little grungy as well. so so disappointed. the top is intentionally oversized and comes down to my crotch  i could have easily sized down.
1,I didn't look close enough when i ordered and failed to see that this was a peplum top.  it did not do my post-pregnancy body any favors.  but the collar area detail is quite nice and this would look great on the right body.
-1,I loved these pants and purchased them in three colors. like another reviewer  within a few weeks  having worn them no more than a couple of times  the fabric in the crotch area started to wear thin and two pairs developed holes. i was not hard on the pants - just wore them to the office - and line dried them. so disappointing  as i really did love the pants. total waste of money.
0,This wears nicely  and is true to photo. flattering in the waist  and on a petite  everything fell in the right places. i also like the lightweight creppy skirt fabric. just one design note - the tie is sort of strange. essentially  there's a long tube of fabric coming out of each side of the bust - and it looks very odd when the ties are undone.
1,I love this shirt except that the hook that keeps it close doesn't work a lot  outside of that i love it. i typically wear a small or extra small and with this shirt the extra small was perfect.
1,This dress is gorgeous. i bought it to wear to the ballet  and i know i will wear it to other formal events as well. it is really fancy---definitely wouldn't wear it to work! i had it hemmed as it was really long on me  and it is a bit tight in the shoulders. it has a beautiful shape and flows while you are walking---it felt pretty!
1,I love this color blue. when this item went on sale i had to grab it and i'm glad i did. it feels medium weight to me so i could throw this on  on a cool summer night and also in the fall. there is some sparkle to the fabric which i think is really a nice added touch. feels comfortable on and looks adorable.
1,Listen up gals - buy every color before they disappear!!! this top is amazing. so flattering  incredible fabric  the colors are divine and the price is amazing! i am not one who wears peplum tops often if ever. a coworker of mine spotted this one in our store and told me as soon as i came in. i'm curvy - generally a l or xl on top and i have hips and a toosh. peplums can often either sit on my hips in an unflattering way  or look like a maternity top on me. this one is magic. hits a big longer 
-1,"Runs very large and way too much fabric. i wanted this top to work because it looks cute on hanger. i usually wear s/m and the xs had too much fabric. may work better on someone with longer torso and taller. i am 5'6.5"" 36c 126lbs"
-1,I can't believe how small this thing runs. beyond small. it's almost insulting because the dress is just so gorgeous you really want it to work  but there's no way it's going to when the l is actually a s. so sad to return this beauty.
1,This tank is perfect for summer since it pairs so nicely with shorts! jeans work well  too  and during cooler seasons  i can wear a cardigan over it to stay warm.    the fit of this top is not true to size  for it runs large  but is flattering on the body nonetheless. the stripes and miniature circular openings  i noticed  add beautiful detail for formal or informal events.    as a whole  this shirt is perfect! the one aspect of this top that may need to be carefully attended to is the material
1,Love this dress! it is super-flattering  and the embroidery is beautiful.
1,"Saw this in the store and immediately liked it. when i tried it on  i loved it. colors are muted  and the style is very flattering. the fabric drapes nicely but is not too heavy  which is perfect for me to wear all through winter in the south. length is perfect for me (5'8""). it does look great off the shoulders  but i also think it can be worn up on the shoulders for a more work-appropriate look. it does run slightly large. i wear a large  but went with a medium in this one so it wouldn't be to"
-1,For those who are wondering this sweater coat is 50% lambswool and 50% acrylic. the original version of this coat was 100% lambswool. 50% acrylic yet the price remained the same???i would have payed more money to have this sweater coat made in 100% lambswool like the original version. this is another example of declining quality and a high price tag for synthetic materials.
0,"I bought the tiny brand ""cassia"" tank last week in a small  and it fits beautifully. i ordered this ""sorcha"" tank in a small as well and it is huge! i am very sad about the huge size difference. look closely at the photos... the fabric twists as it goes over the shoulders to the back....it is quite bulky. hard to tell if that would minimize in a smaller size. my store doesn't carry this item so i can't easily try another."
1,I tried these jeans on at the suggestion of the salesperson and couldn't walk out of the store without buying them even at full price of over $200 which i don't usually spend on jeans.. first of all  the material is so buttery soft you can't believe you are wearing jeans  secondly  i could actually find a pair that would fit my smaller waist in comparison to my larger than i wish hips 27-28 waist  38-39ish hips... 5-4 i ended up with size 26... they are very thin and i worry about how they will
0,This dress was an adorable a-line in the front and a shift dress (no pleats) in the back. tack onto that a high-low hemline and it's just trying to be too many things. would've loved to see this dress as a true a-line/fit-and-flare. it would've been perfect. fits true to size.
-1,I usually wear a 6 and ordered two other skirts at the same time. the other skirts fit perfectly and this one was more like a size 2. very disappointed for i really liked the idea of it.
-1,I purchased this dress for my graduation. the colors are much more intense and bright then they appear online. i'm kind of concerned that i look like a carnival tent. i like the style but the fabric feels cheap for the cost of the dress. the fabric is 100% synthetic.the fit is great. the dress is true to size
0,This is a shift dress  which is a great dress for many people  in a kind of man-repeller way. by saying that  i mean  a really pretty dress that can show off amazing shoes  good legs  a beautiful face and hair. this is not a body con dress. however  when you do such a high neckline and boxy sleeves  you do no one any favors. everyone has a nice neck and decolletage and collarbone. everyone. the neckline needs to open up a bit....i'm not saying v-neck  just a bit lower than this  because it makes
0,I wanted to own this so badly! it ran really short  even with the adjustable slip and was incredibly tight in the shoulders. i could barely get the dress off!
1,"I'm 5'7"" with a 36 b bra size and a size 4 fit perfectly and could not have been more comfortable. one big plus for me is that it is virtually wrinkle free. i purchased the orange which is a lovely muted orange  not neon or too bright and received multiple compliments when i wore it to work the first time."
0,"The high neck and ""square-ness"" did not work for me .. but might for someone else."
-1,This top is too boxy and has too much going on. it should have no buttons or different ones.
0,I wanted to love this top but couldn't. i am curvy (36/27/39; 32dd) and this accentuated my hips (which is not needed) and made my chest/whole shape seem boxy. i could only recommend this top to someone who is smaller chested with a straight build- the bottom would help give some shape; pleating on front would help chest seem larger. i did love the color and construction  lace details  3/4 sleeves.
0,This top runs very large. i am a size 12/14 & purchased the size l. i could have easily fit in the size m. it's a pretty top in a comfortable knit fabric   but the size was overwhelming so i returned it.
1,This dress is gorgeous- it's one of those retailer dresses that i find worth the price because of how unique and beautiful it is! i found it to fit tts. although the zipper does take a good tug to get over the fabric seam  it fits perfectly. if you have a bigger chest (d+)  i would foresee this dress being too snug. however  i am a c and it fits just right! i wore it to a backyard wedding with flat sandals and simple gold hoops  but i love the idea of styling it with a jacket and some wedges or bo
-1,Based on the strength of the other reviews  i thought this sweater would be amazing  but i was disappointed. the knit is very thin  cheap looking and weak that it won't last a season undamaged. it reminds me of a duster i bought 15 years ago at a discount fast-fashion retailer when i was a student. sloppy looking with lots of creases out of the package. collar is odd and the sleeve openings have an annoying flare. the drape is not structured enough--everything about this screams over priced bath
1,I started stalking this dress when i saw it on a store's instagram feed  and i was so thrilled to get it in the mail. however  i ordered it before reviews started popping up  and i was concerned it would not fit in the bust. however  when it arrived  the fit is perfect. it's not exactly loose in the bust  but there also isn't any pilling. the high-waisted nature was also suited to my shape. i'm usually between a 4 and a 6  and the 6 was great in this dress  and a perfectly joyful length--appropr
-1,"Soooo disappointed in this dress. the colors are beautiful for fall. the fabric feels luxe. the slip fits perfectly. the dress however is a hot mess. it is easily two times more fabric than needed to create a flow-y aline dress. huge everywhere. under the arms  and waist and hips. it's just an enormous tent. i am 5'8""  128 lbs. i ordered my usual size small. i looked shapeless in this. i can't think of any body type it would flatter. potentially  women quite far along in their pregnancy."
-1,I usually love maeve and generally feel like everything they make was made for me. sadly  this dress is a definite exception  which could easily have been solved by changing the construction of the dress. as other reviewers stated  the dress does run small  but even if you size up  if you have any breasts at all  the dress will pull at the buttons  causing them to gape (i'm only a b cup  so not on the large side.) i'm pretty sure this is why the model has her arms crossed in the picture. i love
1,I love this top! it's well-made (important if you're in chlorine or salt water) and has vibrant colors. the back strap has two clasp options  so not much room for adjustment but i like this fastening method because you don't have a big bow to lay on when laying out.
1,This skirt is a must have!! it is very classy  and the pockets are perfect for holding lipstick for a little refresher throughout the night. it is high quality and definitely worth the price. i paired this skirt with a more casual black top and some pearls for a fancy banquet dinner  and got a lot of compliments. comfortable and classy.
0,"I was so excited to receive this shirt and so disappointed when i tried it on. it's a lot fuller than it looks in this picture or maybe it's because i ordered a large? i'm 5'8""  180lbs  36d bra size and can fit into a large at retailer just fine but it made me look huge! not flattering at all and it was so full that it looked like a short dress!"
-1,I can not imagine the cut in the waist being flattering on anyone. i ordered an xs and an xxs still would have flared too much in the waste. i ignored the previous review and that was a huge mistake!
1,This bikini is so gorgeous and fit me like a glove. i'm a true xs  bra size 34a. i ordered the small. this was more than worth full price!
1,Iordered hte petite after trying the rregualr size in the store  and i will have to wear heels with the pants... or get them hemmed... the color choices are all great  i wanted navy  but i have a pair of grey ones that look similar  so i deciced on the netural if my size is stil lavaialble in yellow at sale time  i will be grabbing those as well.    i went with 25  my typical size lately (115 lbs)
-1,I wanted to love this sweater. the lavender color and design with the pleated back was beautiful. however when i put it on  it added at least 20 pounds to my frame. unfortunately it's going back since the cut just doesn't work on my frame.
0,Loved almost everything about this top. the colors are great  comfortable fit  but the length was a little too long for my 5'4 frame. i also wasn't a big fan of the large side slit. i would still recommend this great top.
-1,I ordered these in both colors. the red is much deeper in person  more like a burgundy than pictured here. these tees are very slouchy. if you wanted a more fitted look  size down. these are very soft and very comfy and will pair well with ponte leggings and skinny jeans. the overall quality seems very good  although they are thinner than i thought they would be (they seemed like they would be thick and stiff to me based on the photos). ---------- overall these are very nice. but there is one is
1,Love all things mes demoiselles and these do not disappoint! the gold does not show in the picture but they sure do sparkle...in a great way. the fabric is rich and can be worn all year as they are light weight for summer but carry a look perfect with sweaters. i love them and with the sale on sale they were a steal and happy to have them...they will be that one piece that i will grab again and again. i love the look of peasant blouses and shorter vests...in a contrast print would be incredible
0,A nice comfy sweatshirt. i do wish it was just a tad longer; tends to run a little short and therefore looks a little boxy and i'm only 5'3! (i purchased the regular size not the petite)also the front wool insert is a little scratchy as it is not lined on the inside.
-1,This shirt is not near as nice as it may look the fabric is just ok it runs large i ordered a xs and the neck line was huge and gaping not worth the money even on sale
0,I purchased these pants in blue  they fit great - only problem is that one leg is about 1/2 inch longer than the other. i got them on sale with a discount so i will keep them and take them to a tailor to fix. bummer.

0,"The fabric is absolutely lovely on these  but very thin. the top part was tighter than usual (and i sized up from my regular pilcro jean size) and they flare a lot. so the thin  tight top was not a flattering look. the rise also felt short.     i'm 5' 4"" with a 30"" inseam and the regular length just hovered above my ankles. my husband burst out laughing when i tried them on  which is never a good reaction!  even if i hemmed them  i think these are a miss for me. will be returning.    better for"
1,I love the cold shoulder trend! this sweater is not bulky  but the thick knit will keep you warm while looking stylish! it is not your typical sweater. if you want something unique  but still basic  this is your sweater. looks great with jeans and khakis.
-1,I ordered this in blue and the color is absolutely gorgeous! i really loved it until i put it on. wow it was bad. i ordered a small--normally a sm/med due to bust but this was so wide and had so much material. it wasn't long but rather incredibly boxy. one of the most unflattering things i've ever tried at retailer.
0,The one i tried on had something wrong with the pockets... one was regular height t eh other was so low  i could barely put my hand in it. however  the jumpsuit itself is really pretty and soft. color is nice  but hard ot pull off on pale skin like me.  i tried on the xs  but that was big. i would need xxs p if it was made in that size  so i let it go... (looked nice with pinched fabric in the back.    for reference i am 115 lbs  30 dd< 26.5 in waist.
1,This robe is warm  soft and i like how long it is! it's perfect length. my favorite thing to wear around the house!
1,These leggings run true to size. the strappy detail at the ankle is a nice touch. i especially like the quality of the material used as they are not see-through like some leggings tend to be.
1,I tried this skirt on in the store  it fit like a glove (that doesn't happen very often for me) but couldn't find the right top to pair w/ it so i passed on it  but when i got home i found the perfect top already in my closet! so  i ordered it online  it doesn't seem to lay quite as nice as the one i tried on in the store  but i'm keeping it regardless. highly recommended this skirt! fits tts.
0,This is a cute tee but only if you get it on sale. i don't love the material. it seems flimsy and likely to get holes quickly. the pattern is pretty cute but nothing special. glad i got it on sale. as with all retailer tees  size down. xs works good for me.
-1,The xs was too large on me and i'm not a tiny person. while the dress was beautiful on the model  in person it had way too much fabric and fit rather tent-like. the fabric is gorgeous and the dress would have worked if it were more of a fitted style and had half the amount of fabric on the bottom. not flattering at all.
-1,As soon as you get up close to this sweater  you will notice that the bird on the front is of an interesting kind of material-almost like carpet that has been shaved waaaaaaaay down so that the little fibers are sticking straight up and a fraction of a millimeter high. i was not excited about this texture and can imagine it will be a huge magnet for collecting lint and dust throughout the day. the fit was way off on this one for me and was not flattering at all. it wasn't for me at all even thou
-1,I do not understand all the great reviews but that goes to show everyone likes different things! the jacket looks great in the pictures but in person  it just looks awful! gray is one of my favorite colors but this color is so drab and the material looks old and worn. it definitely has a grunge look to it and overall  it is just a wrinkly mess. another reviewer said it looks like old clothes and i have to agree. it looks very shabby. it also reminds me of those smocks they have at the hair salon
0,I personally love this romper. there's a lot of fabric to it  so it feels lush and substantial. and the pockets! they're so roomy i actually couldn't find my phone for a hot second. the crotch of the legs (because  yes  this thing is actually pants) is very long and so i was very comfortable sitting.    the two things i don't love about this piece include the downfall of all rompers imo: not bathroom-break friendly. you basically have to disrobe. and since the legs are so long  you end up clingi
-1,I love the design of this top  however  it's quality is lackluster. the shirt is pretty short and would be more flattering (at least on me) if it had a few more inches. also it's pretty sheer  so figuring out under garments is a dilemma. i will still wear it because i love it. looks great with a denim vest over it!
-1,I ordered this top in size xl. there is a lot of excess material below the empire waist so it flows out too much. this accentuated my pear-shape and was unflattering. the sizing on the top portion & sleeves was true-to-size.     the material is so rough  scratchy & uncomfortable. they should have used a softer fabric. the pattern alignment is terrible on the one i received. at $100  i hoped the plaid would have flowed in a continuous  matching line. i didn't notice the mismatched sleeves of the
0,First of all  the fabric's summery pattern of blossoms  honeybees and butterflies is beautiful and absolutely unique. i love it so much i wish i could afford to keep the dress as an art object. also  with one important exception  the dress is well made. the underslip is the right length and opacity. the dress is not transparent   which is a big plus. there is a slight greenish cast to the background instead of the pure ivory shown  in the pictures. this makes the color a bit harder to wear. and
1,I bought this in store yesterday in a 2 petite - it definitely looks best if you can get it in your usual size (4 petite just looked too big and changes the look). love the embroidery detail. it was on display with the sleeves rolled up to elbows  and it's really cute that way too.
0,This is one of the best potential dresses i've seen from retailer  but it needs a do-over. i'm usually a 12 in this style of dress  but i sized up to a 16 (the largest size) and couldn't even button the top. even if i had been able to do so  i would have worn it as a tunic. i am 5'5'' and the largest size would have been a racy mini skirt at best on me if worn as a dress. this dress is fit for only the tiniest and most small-breasted of people. that said  if the company were to try again ne
1,"Just received yesterday & i love this skirt! it's crazy soft  very flow-y and the higher slits on each side let it be more sexy than hippie-looking which i appreciate. great to pair with a funky pair of tights underneath. sits nicely on your body - hugs your curves.  only annoyance is it's a bit awkward to walk in as the material moves around your legs & gets caught a bit. you definitely have to be conscious of it as you walk.  i bought a m in gray which fit perfectly (i'm 5'9"" & usually a 6). t"
-1,This dress had an odd fit. very loose on top with pointy darts  very tight on bottom. fabric was stiff so it didn't move well with me
1,I just received this dress and i'm glad i read previous reviews and ordered a size up. i normally wear an xs or s and ordered a medium it fits perfectly. the color is beautiful and the dress is unique. can't wait to find a special event to wear it.
1,"I bought these in my usual size 28 and they were much too loose so i returned them. i definitely need a 27 (39 inch hips  33 low waist  31 waist). i have lost a few pounds but i am usually a size 4-6 in pants. even loose i can see the pants are flattering and long enough for my leggy 5' 9"" frame. they are still cropped but i would say look much the same as on the model. if you are shorter  i think the petite option would be necessary to achieve a cropped look. the material is not bright white wi"
-1,I am a pretty curvy girl and thought the m/l was gigantic. i returned and was afraid to exchange for the smaller size thinking it would pbly be very large as well. it was not flattering because it was so boxy.
-1,"After reading the other reviews i still took a chance on ordering this dress becasue it looks so cute on the model. the dress they sent me is not this dress. it is the same material although the one i received had only one stripe down the canter  like a cross. there was no v back as stated by the other reviewer. it was scoop and if you pulled it down  the neck went up. the dress i received is branded as holding horses while the brand listed on here  is rava. the length measured at 39"" not the st"
-1,I love the color of this top but the style is not flattering. i normally wear a l or xl in retailer clothes and i ordered a l in this and it was massive! i went into the store to try on a medium and it fit much better but is still very bulky around the middle where the ruffles are and it is very wide. bummer
0,Giving 3.5 stars due to how big this dress runs. i am 5' 118lbs and i was swimming in the xs. it is a beautiful dress  just beware it runs very large.
-1,I really did. here's why i just couldn't: the lace strips make it look cheap. the fabric is soft    but the pattern is undistinguished.   the fit is very disappointing--medium looked square and boxy  the large was massive and in both sizes the v-neck was too low to wear without a camisole underneath....which defeated the purpose.
-1,These pants look nice and are comfortable but the quality of the fabric is terrible! i should not be surprised because i bought another pair of pants by this same label at antro earlier this year and they did not hold up at all either. but i thought i'd give it another shot. never again! i'm on my 5th wear and the crotch and inner thighs have worn away completely...i mean huge holes in the fabric where it's just disintegrated. even at extra % off the sale price it's not worth it. the full price
-1,I wanted to like this one.. really but it was just plain sloppy looking. i returned it.
0,It's a lovely pattern on a soft tee. the fit is similar to how it looks on the model  not clingy at all. it should be noted that it's fairly see-through. if i wear a bra that's close to skin color it's not an issue  but it is obvious if you're wearing any kind of patterned or contrasting bra. i suppose you could wear a cami underneath  but it's too hot for that in florida and i think it defeats the purpose of a t-shirt. overall  i'm very happy with this  though i'm also very very happy i got thi
1,I love this blouse. the color is very cheerful with it's small white polka dot design. i usually wear a medium but went with the large because the shirt is slightly sheer and i will likely wear a cami underneath.
1,I need to remember that this brand runs small. i ordered the xxsp and i usually have a little room with jacket  but this fits snug. i have one from last year and it's the same. fits snug. if you want extra room  order a size up. the quality is nice  i love the camel brown color. it's a keeper for me  just won't be able to wear a sweater under it.
0,I thought this was so cute online  sweet and feminine  but when it arrived and i tried it on in my usual 12p i felt like i had just stepped back into freshman year of highschool - it is very early 90s - not the bohemian i was going for. it is also very high waisted  even for my little 5'1 frame. i truly felt like they pulled this out of someone's closet  dusted it off and said  ta da! as much as i love rachel and monica i have moved on from their clothing :)
0,"I ordered this in the orange color from online. they were sold out of petite so i ordered medium (regular). i liked it  but just not flattering. i am 5'2"" and the coat was too big. sleeves were past my hands. i think because i'm ""curvy"" the straight cut of coat would not have looked good on me in a size small. it was a nice coat  just not for me."
0,I wanted to love this shirt. i like the style  the material is soft but it was so short on me. perhaps i just have a long torso but it fit everywhere else. i wasn't even able to tuck it in because the sides just were so short.
0,I love this suit! the pattern is just lovely. unfortunately i have to return the suit because i can't wear it. there are no cups or pads or underwire for the chest. you have to look like the model wearing the suit to wear this. if you need any support than give up. who can wear an xl and not have some breasts at all? the neckline is also very low and ended up revealing the top half of my breasts.    the birds of paradise are just lovely  not exactly the same on every suit  but still nice. i just
1,This sweater is gorgeous - the colors are beautiful and the piece itself is soft. i do think it is a bit shorter than i would prefer  and i tend to wear petites. the sweater is nice enough that i do not mind!
0,Definitely pj quality. i have a fairly thin frame and this hung on me like a tent. and it's very thin  so it works as a swim cover  but definitely not a dress for anything else.
-1,These socks were very thin and the elastic at the top was very rigid. i could not get these socks to go any higher than half-way up my calf. i would not recommend this product. it felt very cheap and not of good quality.
1,"What a great top! i am 5'9"" - 136 lbs with a 34d chest.. and this top looks and feels great on. i am usually a 6 and the small fit perfectly. i purchased the grey and it is a nice medium grey color. the v in front hits in a great spot.. not too low  but just low enough to look feminine. i haven't washed and dried the top yet  so i hope it looks as good after washing as it does brand new. i was hesitant to order because of the earlier reviews  but i find this top really works for me  so i am glad"
0,While the styling is cute  the fit was poor under the arms and there was quite a gap. i returned this.
0,"I was really hoping that this dress would fit perfectly because it looks beautiful on the model! however  when i put the dress on  there is a seam where the top portion meets the bottom portion and it made the skirt stick out a ton. i ordered the 0p and i am 5'4"" 110lbs. maybe ordering this dress in a larger size would prevent the skirt from looking so full at the top."
1,Comfortable  relaxed fit. i am very top heavy and the generous cut of this dress worked well!
0,I wanted to love this dress because the color is so amazing  but the arm holes are huge! i am petite and tried this on and it just sadly didn't work.
0,The pattern of this skirt is adorable and looks better in person but the fabric isnt the best. it feels like an elastic fabric and is way to volumous. overall not my favorite.
0,This is a flattering  comfortable  soft sweater the instant you put it on. a few instants after that  however  i found mine had relaxed a great deal to become baggy  and pilled even more to become a fuzzy wuzzy monstrosity. i'm not optimistic about its longevity and wouldn't recommend it except for the extravagant single-use buyer.
0,This very lightweight cardigan looked like an eggplant color online. it's brown with a hint of burgandy. not bad  but unexpected. i am very short -waisted  and this lies very high on my torso. the seams are unfinished  and it looks cheaply made. glad i got this on sale.
1,The fabric quality and style are amazing. the fabric is very high quality and so soft and the style is nice for an adult. i generally don't wear shorts because of length  style and other problems but i can wear these without feeling like a high schooler. i usually wear a 24/00 in pants  i ordered the 0 and was worried that it would be too loose and look sloppy on me but it fits amazingly. one of my favorite purchases ever!!!
0,Dress caught my eye on the rack so i thought i'd try it on. the dress has lovely blue stripes (hard to discern in the online photo) which makes it a great year-round piece. however  like others have commented  it is too low to wear to work. will consider alternations to close the v-neck if the dress is marked down beyond its current sale price.
1,Love this blouse. the owl design is flawless front to back. the material has a silk like feeling. i would say the arms a slightly tighter than i would prefer. if you have larger arms or have any muscle the sleeves may be tight on you. also  i am a 38 c and the chest fit well (in size large)  but would not offer much more room for a larger chest. if you want a looser and relaxed fit as the model shows  i would size up. i love the unique design!
-1,This suit was high quality  and a cute design. however  it is clearly made for a lean body type.
1,I have a pair of elevenses very similar to the turquoise and grey pair  and i get non-stop compliments on them. they are very flattering and drape beautifully. the fabric is also complete no-fuss and no-fade. this time  i went for the red pair  and i love them. they really go with the current upscale 70s vibe; they have the 70s attitude without the poor quality of most vintage 70s clothes.
-1,I don't normally write reviews  but this shirt was so terrible  that i felt inspired.     first off  the seam that is in both the front and back of the shirt is much more pronounced than in the photo. secondly  there is no shape whatsoever  unlike in the photo. it bells out like a tent. it honestly looks like a shirt you would buy if you were trying to appear pregnant when not. overall  this shirt is an insult to the female form.     retailer  what is with all of these shapeless  frocks in cheap f
-1,I ordered the xl in white. for fit  it's true to size. it matches the model's photos. it's a comfortable top. the shape is good with the pleating. but  the color is definitely off. it's as if the white fabric was pre-washed with navy. it's not the fresh  crisp white shown  at least for the one i received.     the quality of the material is basic. the black version might be the better one overall. i'm going to exchange the white one i have to give that a try. overall  i don't think it's worth ful
0,I really wanted to like this shirt but it doesn't seem to be of that great of quality and is much more sheer than indicated in the photographs. the shirt is very clingy and doesn't hang well. i sent it back
-1,Loved the sweater and the sale price was great  but i could not take the shedding! even after just trying it on the first time  my jeans and top had shedding all over them. this was 2 minutes  i could not imagine what i would look like if i wore it all day. had to return.
1,I had to order this dress three times to get the correct size. ordered a petite which worked great. i really like the dress now that i found the size that fits best. love the color! perfect for so many occasions  church  special events and dinner out. great with flats and wedges. i know i will be wearing it lots this summer. did i mention i love the color! worth repeating.
0,Not for the curvy women. fit in the waist but bunched around the crotch
0,Tried this on in store and it runs very small. i am a size 4  but have curvy hips  so i sized up to a size 6 and i couldn't even button it. i was hoping it was more of an a-line  but it's fit more like a pencil skirt. not very flattering on my body type. overall  cute design  but not for me.
1,My mother  who is not a dress person  ordered this dress for a summer wedding in the black hills. we'd spend 20+ hours searching for the perfect dress  and she'd returned three other options (different stores). after admiring this dress for awhile  she decided to try it  and is so happy she did! the color is just a slightly darker shade of purple than what is pictured in most of the images  but that's what she was hoping for. it fits wonderfully  and looks extremely elegant.
1,I tried on the blue in store and ordered the red in petite  and they are both too long (which means i will have to hem). i am not sure if i want to spend the extra money on hemming so hanging on to them for now as i love hte cut and color. they fit like a glove otherwise (i do have muscular thighs). the 0p is good for me (115 lbs). can't go wrong for a nice pant  i can see wearing these out or for work...
1,This sweater runs a bit large/bulky around the bottom area. you can kind of see in picture. i purchased this online in medium as i'm 5'9 so normally wear that size. i could probably have ordered a small but will keep the medium  just a little too full around the hem. also  the v neck is somewhat low cut. pink color is nice and pale pink.
1,This is a great little top. the tie sits right at the waist and loose enough to slide over top of pants or shorts. the detailing at neck and shoulders is very eye catching. i received several compliments when i wore it.
1,I threw this into my cart online on a whim  but i'm not disappointed! and i don't even wear rompers usually. for reference  i'm 5'2 and normally a size 2  and i bought this romper in a size xs petite. if you're on the shorter side  i definitely recommend buying it in the petite size  as i feel that this romper would run large in the regular sizes. the fabric of the top drapes nicely on me  and the shorts are about medium length. i like the neckline details. the armholes in the petite size aren't
1,This flew out of my local store so fast i had to order on line. simply stunning. was reluctant to pay high price but worth it. will get much wear.
-1,The pants are pretty and run true to size  but the fabric is bathing suit like  very thin and sheers in the butt when you squat. i wouldn't recommend for anything but waking.
-1,Lovey top in the photos. however  its fairly large and the chest area can make you look even larger. i'm 5'3  118lbs  36c. generally wear xs or 2s in retailer tops. ordered the xs but it was just too large and unflattering. the lace work is so pretty. it has potential but the design doesn't work well for some.
1,I&#39;ve been eyeing this dress for weeks. finally i took the plunge and bought it! the velvet is gorgeous and the style is fun and playful. i know many of the reviewers said it was running large  but i had to order an xl because i nearly got stuck in the l (no stretch). im normally a size 16 and carry most of my weight in my stomach butt and hips. definitely more of a shift than a swing. however its still just lovely. looking forward to paring it with a kimono for a wedding tomorrow!
-1,"I am almost always an xs in bottoms (sz 0-2) but literally couldn't get the stretchy waistband (no zip or fastening) in xs up my hips. in addition  the ""brocade"" is a very lightweight polyestery  tinselly weave--does not suggest quality. as others have noted  it also runs short; i'm 5'3'' and this was a little below knee length on me  not ankle-length. i've had luck with retailer's sale section in the past  including some items that didn't always start off with the best reviews  but have no regret"
0,I had to call so many stores to track this shirt down and in the end it wasn't worth it. i got an xs and it was quite baggy. i never buy petite shirts because i feel like they are too short but in this case i think the shirt would have been perfect in whatever the smallest petite size is. for someone who's bigger i'd definitely check this shirt out.
-1,I loved this coat in the picture  and couldn't wait to get it. sadly  it did not deliver in real life. i got my usual size small  and it fit well in the shoulders and sleeves  and okay in front. the big problem was the back. it just hung from my shoulders with zero shape  and a lot of extra fabric. i considered trying the xs  but was concerned that the shoulders might not be comfortable  and honestly i can't believe the xs could possibly have been different enough to work. maybe i got a defectiv
-1,So much right but then....too short.
-1,This top seemed so unique online  but in person it was really nothing like the pics. super full  shorter cut. the quality wasn't what i thought it would be. i will gladly pay for nice quality fabric and unique prints anyday... but this wasn't any of those things..

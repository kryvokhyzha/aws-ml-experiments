1,I was really pleased with this skirt. the lightness of the fabric is nice and the colors matched the photos. i was initially concerned that it might be stiff and uncomfortable  but it feels like it has a bit of stretch and offers some good movement. sometimes retailer skirts seem to run small to me  but this fit perfectly in my regularl size.
0,I was really excited to see what this looked like in person. when i unpacked this shirt i was shocked to see what how short it looked. the colors are very close to what you see online but the shirt is super boxy. i have a smaller torso and it barely came to below my waist. you can't tell by the picture but this shirt can fit at least 2 people in the width. when i tried it on  it didn't look as boxy but still a really weird cut! it was disappointing because it looks so cute online! i will be retu
-1,I tried this shirt in a small (my usual retailer size) and it was very unflattering.   the fabric was ultra soft and it seemed it was nicely made.  however  this shirt is so unstructured and oversized  i might as well worn a brown paper bag.
0,I really loved the look of this dress online and couldn't wait to try it on. based on my measurements i ordered a petite medium  following the petite size chart. the dress was the perfect length for my 5'5 frame  but it was just way too loose and not flattering on my figure. i'm 36c-32-37 and i looked like a sack of potatoes in the dress. the fabric and lining feel great though. i just wasn't the right fit for me.
-1,Usually an retailer dress in a large fits me perfectly however not this one. i am larger busted and this dress was way too tight on top. possibly better on smaller chests. the dress is cute and the rest of the fit was good. not for me could barely pull it down over the boobs. going back :(
-1,This would have been a cute top but the shoulder seams come halfway down the arm and give it a really weird shape. it looks smooth and fine on the model but in real life they stick out and make you look boxy. too bad!
0,This blouse is gorgeous  but as other reviewers have noted it runs small and it's very thin. the back is see-through  not the front  though if you tend to wear things a little large and order up a size  the back is fine. my real issue is that it shrank so much when i washed it (on cold  delicate cycle  hang dry) that it's pretty much unwearable now. sad.
1,This is m frist pair of flares  and i love them--make my legs look miles long and they're also my most comfortable jeans. i'm 5'4 and around 108 lbs with narrow hips--the 25 fits perfectly. i've worn them with 3 inch heels and the jeans dust the floor (longer than on the model but i like that look; if i wanted to wear them with flats they'd need to be hemmed  but i prefer heels anyway) ii've avoided high-rise jeans out of fear they'd look matronly  but combined with the flare  the high waist is
0,Bought these for the color however these just did not work for me. the 26 was too small and the 27 was baggy. i'm 5'3 and typically wear a 26. beautiful color and good denim. if you are looking for a looser fit  more of a straight leg fit...this is a good jean with a fun pop of color.
0,I'm 4'10 and 105lbs..32c and hippy...i ordered the 00p and 0p.. bc i'm curvy the bigger size was better but the fit was just okay..couldn't justify the price. it's a beautiful dress in the green color. the zipper is difficult to get down and worries me that it would break.. but if it fit i would've overlooked it.. the major reason for returning is the slit was so high my butt cheeks were exposed if you lifted it... i would've had to have it sewn shut.
-1,This jacket is so cute and fits perfect and i love the motif. however  it deposited black linty particle all over my pants and top and the fabric was already pilling just from being on the hanger in the store. this piece will look bad/worn/old in a very short period of time. it's a big shame  because it's so perfect in every other way. i choose not to buy it. it's very expensive for the quality.
-1,I was intrigued by the pattern of this blouse (the purple version) but the design is terrible for me. it's boxy  i didn't like the fabric  and the arm ruffles are bizarre. it's going back tomorrow.
0,"I was disappointed when the dress came in the mail. it was much shorter on my than on the model in the picture. (i am 5'5"") the detail of the dress and fabric shown in the picture is not as prominent in person which was also disappointing. the dress is just average. i didn't not return the dress...it looks much better on my younger sister (who is the same height) so i gave it to her. i guess it's just not the right dress for me."
-1,I've been buying stevie ankles for years from retailer and been very happy. the past two pairs i bought had a heavy chemical smell  which i imagine is some kind of starch/chemical to keep the denim stiff. with the first pair  after enough washes to get rid of the bad smell (4)  they lost all form and looked terrible since they were washed i couldn't return them. the 2nd pair arrived with the same heavy smell and i returned them. it may be they are made elsewhere now  but it's disappointing.
1,Beautiful fabric  great quality  fits true to size. love them!
1,I love this sweater. it is so soft and the pink is such a sweet shade. it is large and falls of the shoulder  but that's how it is designed to fit. it is my new favorite sweater!
1,Saw this hanging in the store. it is cute front and back.  it is flattering as well. i plan to wear under a jacket for work and without a jacket at night.  looks amazing with a denim jacket
-1,Very disappointed when i received this. the colors and ombre fabric are beautiful. beading and embroidery make it a even more unique top however the shape ruins all of that. first it is nearly a crop top. second  it is boxy and it's attempt to be a swing top only makes it bulky. third  need to size down 2 sizes. had to return this.
1,This is the first maxi i purchased this summer. i went with a petite as the regular length would need to be altered and i didn't want to lose some of the pattern on the bottom. it is a beautiful flowy dress. no need for a slip. it has beads on the bodice. i kept the dress but it is tight at the chest area and sizing up wouldn't have made that much of a difference..kinda uncomfortable in the chest area. has yet to be worn so may return..
1,I purchased this top as a swim suit cover-up and it is perfect! i was counting on the model in the photo being tall so that the top would be longer on me and that was true. great product.
-1,It fits super baggy everywhere and looked sloppy on me.
1,"This is a beautiful dress  just not for me though. since i'm 5'10"" it hit me 2-3"" over my knees. the colors are vibrant- would look good on most!"
0,"I'm 5'1"" and this top was too long for me. it's pretty but expensive for what it is."
1,"I agree with the previous review  i too would not have purchased it if i had not tried it in the store (which is 2 hrs from my house!). the colors are much more saturated but not gaudy. the caveat  it is quite short. i am 5'10""  135 lbs. i purchased a medium as it gave me the length i needed."
1,This is a gorgeous buttondown. the colors are stunning - i love the mix of blue and brown. the fabric is super soft and drapes just right. i feel the this shirt runs true to size. i'm an xxs petite and it fit perfect. this one is a winner!
0,I tried on 4 different dresses and every one of them had a slightly different  awkward hem line. they were asymmetrical but only a tad bit so it just looked crooked. finally found one that wasn't so bad but decided not to purchase because the perfect fit for my arms was too big in the boobs. i am a curvy  athletic build  with broad shoulders and small waist  for your reference.
0,Really liked this dress  but it ran too big for me.
0,Wanted to love this dress as it's perfect for transition. i'm a curvy gal who usually sports an xl in dresses at retailer  and unfortunately this one was way too big even for me to pull off. my boyfriend actually guffawed when he saw me in it. i would implore the maker to try this style again as it's a good one  unfortunately the sizing was it's downfall.
-1,I ordered a small  but it was way to big. it was very soft.
1,I  sadly  only noticed this top once on sale. i tried on the xs and it was just a bit big  i would need the petite  so i had to leave it behind (115 lbs  30dd) - but it is adorable  can be dressed up and classy  casually with jeans  or sweetly  so many ways... love the subtle polka dots... oh well  i am sure i will find something similar i love!
0,It broke my heart to have to return this dress -- the fabric is simply gorgeous  very high quality  and i love the contrast between the yoke and the rest of the dress. but it was simply not flattering on me. i am 5-4 with a relatively large bust and an overall medium build. the small size fit me perfectly  but the cut just didn't look good on me. i have other tunic dresses that look great on me with tights and boots. so i am not entirely sure why this dress just didn't work for me. it may be tha
1,This jacket is a real treasure and i could never have seen how substantial the embroidery is from the photo. also from the pic the jacket looks like a thin cotton  but on the contrary it is a wonderful weight with a feel like denim. the embroidery is a wonderful texture like heavy string or thin rope so it really has dimension... . i loved it so much i got the sweatshirt also by the same designer. can't wait until cooler weather so i may live in it! also when you have it on for a bit it seems to
-1,Very very boxy design/cut. try on first or buy knowing you are 90% likely to return. beautiful skirt but if you don't have the right body type/measurements  will not flatter you at all.
0,Without seeing the 'online exclusive' notation  i went into my local retailer store to try on this sweater because sometimes i wear small and sometimes a medium. once the very helpful retailer employee looked it up and advised they don't carry it in stores  i ordered it at the check-out desk in a size medium. i was so excited with anticipation because i love stripes and i love the color gray... this sweater was right up my alley. i was very disappointed when i decided to return it. first of all  i d
1,I've been looking for a staple long-sleeve tee for a while now  and i think i've found it! i bought this tee in my usual retailer size of medium and the fit is perfect. the material is soft  the cut highlights an hourglass figure without clinging in the wrong places. the sleeves are long enough  which can sometimes be a problem for me. the length is perfect to wear with leggings without being too long. i'll be back for more colors!
-1,I normally wear a medium with these types of fabrics but this one was oddly proportioned on me. the skirt was also not very flattering to my hourglass figure  but it at least fit well. the top was baggy and gaped at the armpits as stated by others. i really wanted to like this dress but it made me look 20 pounds heavier even in the places it looked too big on me. i could have tried going with a small but the skirt would have then been too short.
-1,Description is wrong. not a swing tunic. more long and straight. keep that in mind when buying this. if you have hips  this might not be the top for you
0,These ran true to size  but the fabric is very stiff and unforgiving. i'm athletic and have lean legs  but these seemed to cling to and roll on every dimple on my thigh. and sitting down was uncomfortable at the knees because of the stiff fabric. i loved how they fit at the waist  but the legs just didn't work for me. sadly returning these.
1,Unique pattern. got lots of compliments! great fall accessory!
0,This dress is very cute and fits quite well. you don't have to wear a bra with it  which is awesome  and it has delightful pockets. the downside is that the fabric on the top half is a little weird. it is very heavy and stiff. also  the inside has some fraying and the quality does not seem to be the best. i'm keeping it though.
1,Cute staple in classic style overall.  fabric weight is good  will be able to get by with nude bra.  many wardrobe options with this staple.
-1,Not flattering and not the color it appears online. this is really a pink shirt.
-1,Really wanted to love this top but the proportion was not right for my body type. also the print with the silhouette was a bit too country bumpkin for me.
1,This is one of those just throw on and go dresses that i love. it is breezy and easy  comfortable  but also polished and lovely with some really nice design features and a beautiful mixed print. you can wear it with some cute flip-flops  or polish it up with some cute boots.
0,Stylist in store warned be about issues with buttons falling of easily. loved the look  so bought it anyway. lost 2 buttons on the first wear. it did not feel snug on me  but i guess i could try a size up and see if the buttons hold a bit better. either way i will return or exchange.
1,"I like the top without the fake fur collar. when the collar is removed the neckline's shape is really nice. the collar seems cheap. i thought the sweater ran true to size. i'm 5'7"" 115 lbs. a small was a good fit although higher armholes would have made the whole thing fit better through the rib cage. it was loose there  but necessary looseness for layering anything underneath."
-1,"This top is a joke unless you are really into expensive clown wear. i thought this looked whimsical  fun and a well-designed piece when i saw it on line--especially at this high price. i started to laugh before i even pulled the entire top of out the bag when i got it in the mail today. it is not expensive looking at all  and the pom poms look like a sad craft project rather than a special detail. it is a bit juvenile too. even if you wore it and were going for ""ironic""  it would be difficult to"
-1,I agree with the other reviewers  this top is completely disappointing in every way  i could not believe it was the same top i pulled from the bag. where to begin .......  it runs really big  it's short and boxy  not at all like it appears on the model  this must be pinned a lot in this picture.  colors are completely dull in person  i really think this picture was lightened a great deal.  fabric feels cheap and stiff  lining is stuff and poorly sewn.  i haven't one positive thing to say about t
1,I was so impressed with the style & boning on the sides for the perfect fit! it's truly a classic staple in your closet for that lbd!!
1,This vest kept catching my eye online. i was ordering moth cashmere cowlneck sweater  (which is fabulous ) when i noticed pictures posted of women wearing both the vest & sweater. the more i looked at these pictures  the more i fell in love with the vest. needless to say  i purchased the vest in my usual size xs which fits tts. it's incredibly soft & a great piece to add to your wardrobe!
-1,The pattern and colors are very pretty  and the material is soft and silky. i returned it  though  because it is very low-cut in the front. it comes down to between my breasts  which is not going to work for me.
0,"Bought a pair of the gray and loved them  but after i washed them i saw the color was distorted as if bleach from a previous wash was still in the machine.     so i ordered a second pair this one in green - same thing happened after i washed it. looked at instructions (finally!) and it says to wash in cold water - i washed in warm. could that be the problem?     anyway - now they both look like there's discoloration and not a ""washed look"" that's on purpose.     i'll still wear them  but an expe"
0,The dress fits me like a tent and i looked pregnant. maybe this style isn't for me and i even sized down. otherwise the quality was lovely with an embroidered area on the top and the fabric style mixing was great and very trendy. it didn't work for me for the right person this is a very well made dress.
0,Doesn't fit as tight/as slimming as you think it would by looking at the picture  definitely order one size down if you want it to fit tight!
1,I love these pants! first  they are super flattering. for a new mom  the waist comes up high and tucks everything in without rolling over. second  they are versatile. you can pair them with pointed flats  boots or casual with sneakers. i am wearing mine with cream flats and the cream moth boucle colorblocked pullover sweater. also - normally i am an xl (especially for length!) but the large fit perfectly. i didn't want to say that they ran large  because they aren't too loose.
0,Like a previous reviewer mentioned the jeans do not necessarily look like the one in the photo. i first ordered them in my regular size and also had to notice that they are cut like men's jeans with legs so skinny that i could only force them over my calves. the embroiding is beautiful  but it also stops the material from stretching  so the the super skinny legs are a real problem. also  they are not as intensely stone washed as shown in the picture. i decided to order them again one size bigger
1,This skirt is great for anyone who wants to highlight a defined waistline  but may want to skim over a few lumps and bumps. the skirt has a nice  wide waistband that hugs tight at the middle and pleats that give a little flare without being too much.  the fabric is nice and thick and the skirt is lined.  i am looking forward to wearing it to the office with a fitted dark top and heels.
0,This pretty bohemian dress is murdered by the horrible rayon fabric with metallic thread that feels like little needles pricking my skin. i have a pretty high itch tolerance as wool doesn't bother me too much. i'm not sure how most of the reviewers are tolerating this dress  even with the slip  which doesn't cover the arms and makes me want to tear this dress off. i decided to keep and wear as an autumn/winter dress in which i will remove the slip  wear a deep scoop neck long sleeve top undernea
1,Love this jacket!got my usual size medium and is perfect! beautiful quality
1,These legging are adorable. i love that i was able to get them in a petite size and the detailing of these pants are awesome. the buttons at the ankle are cute. i truly feel these leggings are worth the price i paid for them because normally i don't like to spend so much on leggings.
0,"I loved this dress in the photos and couldn't wait to try it on in person. the print varies from dress to dress and mine had noticeably much more cream color in it. i didn't mind too much but it didn't look like the dress the model is wearing. i bought the xxs petite which fit true to size. the v neck is a bit low for petite sizing but the length was perfect on my 5'2"" frame which was a plus. i agree with the other reviewers the fabric is cheap and feels cheap. not something i would expect from"
-1,"The shirt is beautiful  but fits much too small. the stitching limits the space in your shoulders  and the hem too short. a petite frame would be able to pull this off- but i am a 5.10"" medium  and the shirt didn't work in every direction."
-1,I loved this romper so much! the material is thin  but perfect for summer. the style is just what i was looking for. it's so so cute and fit perfectly...at first. i wore it one time and then washed it exactly as described on the tag and it shrunk beyond recognition. it went from loose and flowy  like on the model  to little booty shorts and a body suit...not the look i was going for. i am so disappointed.
-1,Material is thin  with a fleece like feeling on the inside. hard to describe but almost feels like a really thin north face material. the cut on the sides of chest area is super awkward  shows way too much  would never be appropriate to wear a regular bra underneath.
-1,I'm not sure why this dress is getting great reviews. the plunging neckline is ridiculous and ran down to the underwire of my bra and the slit up the side came up to the upper part of my thigh. it was one of the worst fitting/cut dresses i've every tried on at retailer. i'm 5'4 125. maybe you have to be 6 feet tall and 90 pounds for this dress to not look like a bad renaissance faire costume.
0,I couldn't believe there weren't more reviews complaining about the arm size... then i found them!  yes  this is a cute shirt  if you have toothpicks for arms!  so true!  the shirt is adorable... a bit guazy (so not going to be super warm for fall/winter... but i live in cali so that's not an issue).  but  my arms aren't even big  and this shirt is so snug around my arms!  unfortunately it's going back :(
0,I ordered a small and i'm usually always a small. i could not zip it up. i'm am returning it for a large  and this is concerning because what if it is big in a weird way because i'm usually a large?
-1,"Like other reviewers  i saw this dress on the cover of the catalog and knew i had to have it! well  i am very disappointed. the colors aren't as rich as the outdoor photo  although they're brighter than shown in the studio photos. this is just not a flattering dress. i've put it on three times and taken it back off. the neck is too high  the sleeves are too narrow (and i have really skinny arms)  and there's no ""swing"" to it. i am 5'4"" and weigh 120 pounds and bought a size small  which is what"
0,I wanted to love this warm dress because the colors and the material are beautiful. unfortunately  i couldn't make the fit work. for reference  i am 5'3  110 pounds and usually wear an xs in retailer clothing. like other reviewers  i found the xs to be a bit tight around the arms  and i don't have particularly large arms  so i ordered the sp  hoping it would be roomier and shorter (the regular length came down to mid-knee). unfortunately  the sp was enormous; it was in no way a petite. it was as l
-1,The cut of the top portion of the dress is off. i tried on the s in-store & it bunched up in the breast area. i ordered a sp hoping the petite would fix the problem - nope - still bunched up. for reference i am a 34b. i would have kept the dress and given 5 stars if it wasn't for said flaw.
-1,For a couple weeks  i debated making this purchase. in fear that my size would no longer be available  i ordered this lovely top. when it arrived  i was immediately disappointed with its colors...unlike the vibrant colors in the photo  the top's colors were dull...more a brown than orange and gray rather than lavender. had the fit been better  i would have kept this item despite of its color. it's cut weird! though it runs slightly large  i felt the top was ill fitted through the upper bust and
1,Love cloth and stone. this dress looks and fits exactly as pictured. soft and casual  with great design details.

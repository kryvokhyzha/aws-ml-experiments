0,"I so wanted to like these pants. i wear a lot of ""genie"" pants because they're comfortable. the problem with these is that they're too narrow towards the ankle  but the worst is the fabric. its ""old lady"" fabric. i was hoping for a pair of blousy joggers in a light denim  and this fabric was disgraceful. i knew the minute i saw them that they were going back. i'll keep looking and hoping."
-1,I was excited to get this romper  but it just didn't work. i'm petite with a large bust and the blousy design of the top portion just hung like a bag on me. returned.
0,"I ordered this sweater in green  and it was a lovely soft color. the style of the sweater was nice -- really deep side splits made it feel trendy. the sweater is a great length  nice fabric and the side splits are appealing. however  it was just so  so big that i couldn't pull it off -- i just swam in it. i am 5'8"" and 118 lbs  fairly wiry?.even the xs didn't work for me. perhaps it would look more suitable on a curvier woman. i even considered having it tailored  since i've had a hard time find"
1,Very cute  very comfortable. for me aesthetics and comfort must go hand in hand. this dress fits the bill.
-1,"I loved the color and design until i tried it on in the store. i am 5'5"" with a slender build. i tried my usual xs but couldn't manage to put this shirt on me without risking smear my makeup or scratch my face by the elastic band at the neckline. the band is so small even fully stretched out. i have a normal sized head just in case you wonder... i gave up after wrestling with it. i can only imagine how uncomfortable to wear something with a tight elastic band choking me...funny... but not funny."
-1,I couldn't wait to get this top in the mail since they didn't have it at my local retailer  but i was so disappointed in both the quality and fit. the white is completely see-thru  i can't believe how sheer the material is - especially for the price. even as the shirt is lying down  i can see through both layers of it... the fit runs small  and short.
1,I was very hesitant to purchase this with such a high price tag but i just received it in the mail and it is absolutely beautiful. feels and looks high quality and i can't wait to pair it with the top the model is wearing in the photos. definitely worth it!
1,I picked these up the other day looking for a good jeans alternative. i love them. they are the perfect fit of slim but not skinny. i went with my normal size (26) and so far after one wear  they are still in good shape. a little bit of stretch  but not too much. the moss color is so crisp and goes with a lot. they will be perfect for transitioning into fall.
-1,"I'm happy the other reviewers made this dress work because it looked terrible on me. i'm 5 9"" and 128 lbs and it made me look like i had gained 25 lbs. as others have said  the pockets make the dress even worse-it's very hard to get them to lay flat. the material is lovely  soft and i liked the gray color  but this dress made me feel like i was wearing something from an asylum."
0,I bought this top online in the stripes/ivory lace. fits great and is beautiful quality. (i usually wear small/size 4 in tops and the small was perfect). however  i found that the ivory lace detail on the bottom sides gave me a saddlebag effect. not good. sadly it's going back.
1,Great top  lately i've been sizing down from my usual xs to xxs with pure & good tops  but in this one the xs was best. i bought this in 3 colors and they're my go to tanks for summer. the mint is a bit sheer  but not bad. i did not get try the yellow or white one.
1,Absolutely gorgeous skirt! so feminine and curve hugging. wish i hadn't found this so late! want it in every imaginable color  but i will settle for the off white.    please bring this style back!
0,Love the knit  color  texture--but oddly a short and boxy fit...and so...not flattering.
-1,I disagree with other reviewers on this. it looks a lot better in picture on the model. i found it to run large and not fit in the most flattering way. fabric feels great. i want to love it but it is going back.
1,This sweater is very comfy and looks great with tighter leggins. beautiful color
0,"I am 5'8"" 140 lbs.  34b  and i ordered the 6 in denim. the dress is certainly tts: the 6 fit like a glove but wasn't at all tight. perhaps my expectations were too high with this dress--based on the other reviews  i thought that it would be perfect for my pear-shaped figure. however  i found that the a-line skirt accentuated my lower half  thereby making me look larger than i am  so i sent it back. otherwise  this is a great dress. it certainly did manage to hide lumps and bumps in spite of bein"
1,Comfy  but constantly picking pills off of it  from first wear.
0,I want to love this dress. the colors and pattern are gorgeous  and i love the hemline. but something seems off in the chest and shoulders area. it almost feels a little slouch-y.
-1,I'm 5'2-5'3 which is supposed to be the max height for pieties in retailer (former employee) and while the bodice hit right  the skirt was insanely long. not even with heels is this gonna be right. and no discount towards hemming? i'll wait until this hits the sale rack  which it will because concensus is  it's way too long.
0,As with other maeve dresses  the fit is great. i love the empire waist with stud details. the slip is nice and stretchy and i really like the flowy chiffon look over a fitted slip. i'm not too keen on the way the sleeves tie and find that the ties get in the way of everything. when i first saw this online  i was super excited to find it in the stores because i loved the big orange snake that is on the back of the dress shown online. however  only the smallest size had the great snake on the back
1,Gorgeous top/tunic. runs true to size. i paired it with jeans  but i love the look of the white pants in the picture. beautiful and flows nicely.
-1,I am sooooooo massively disappointed in this purchase. i thought i had found the perfect pant in this style. both more comfortable and more flattering than similar styles in the store. i wanted to wear them every day; received lots of compliments; felt that you could dress up or down; etc. this is where i have to admit that i wore them several times straight from the store before washing. on the second wear  i noticed threads coming out on the seams  but just on one side of one leg. this was irr
0,This top is so cute but after i added my tank top under neath it made me look frumpy. however  if you pair it with the right tank and bottoms it could be very cute. i think my problem is that i am not long wasted enough. i wish that it had worked because it is so unique.
0,I was hoping to love this tunic  but it isn't what i was hoping for. the material is cute  but the piece itself is a little too baggy and just doesn't do anything for my shape. just made me look boxy all around. it felt more like a poncho than a tailored tunic. unfortunately  it has to go back.
0,The material is awesome and it's a super pretty dress it just didn't work on my body.
1,"I bought a size small (5'6"" & 130lbs). it was baggy everywhere so i added a belt similar to the model and it did help some but the pockets stuck out too much. i ended up looking ""hippy"" with no butt. the material is nice and it is a nice quality. i just didn't have enough to fill it out anywhere and i felt if i got a xs it would have been too short in the crotch area."
0,"I *loved* the brown color on the model  and i love the wrap style in general. however  i'm not sure if the color looks as goon on me. i first ordered my standard size small (5'7""  137 lbs 32 b)  which fit  but exchanged it for the looser fit (medium) shown in the pictures. i really like that the material is a thin  but not see through cotton. it has an extra cotton layer lining in front which is nice. the v isn't too low on me  so i don't *have* to wear a cami under. not really crazy about the s"
0,I ordered a large  and was hopeful that this would be as comfy and stylish as others reviewed. for me  it was not. it ran a little small on top  buttons bulged at my chest  and was hard to put on. bottom part fit well (although flattened my butt unflatteringly). i'm sure this works for some  just wasn't the right fit for me. sent it back.
-1,"The small  zipped and laid flat  measures 16"" across at the bottom of the armholes  11"" at the waist and 18"" from shoulder seam to bottom edge. it's too small for a size 0  and not by just a little! too bad  because it really is very pretty."
-1,I want to be the person who lounges like the model...but this was huge and more wool-feeling than the lightweight shawl i was hoping for. i am an 8  got the xs/s it was the right size....i returned it.
0,This dress (i ordered the ivory) is stunning. it is fully lined  the belt adds a needed accent  and the print on the fabric is gorgeous. the fit  though  is another issue. i typically wear a 2-4 depending on the cut and fabric of dresses  and am pretty proportionate with my hips/bust. i ordered a 2 in this dress. it was enormous on the top and painfully tight on my hips and thighs. the fabric has absolutely no give - it needs to drape perfect or it looks awful. if you have any type of hip  thigh
1,"I just received this dress in petite extra small. for reference  i am 5""7 and 118 pounds. to answer the previous reviewer's question  the regular size of this dress runs long. if you want it to look like the one in the video  then order it in petite. i personally love the style and the material. however  the inside slip is very short with the petite given my height but this can be solved by adding a half slip underneath it."
-1,I grabbed this dress to try on in my usual size  because i needed to see what the hype was about this style of dress  and it left me puzzled.  the print was pretty  but no amount of tailoring could save it for me.  it was wearing me.  maybe it could wear three of me.  i feel like this is a way for clothing manufacturers to cut corners  by making a garment without details (no installing more time consuming zippers  buttons or snaps  and making something that fits a wide range of sizes because it
0,First  i love moth clothing and own many  many of their pieces. this is very cute and i purchased it to go with the jules tank. the other reviewers are spot on with the cute factor and that it runs a little larger than the cropped sweaters. the snails are very cute  buttons run all the way down... caveat: it began to pill after only a having it on a few hours - and i wasn't doing anything to cause extra friction- just sitting and lounging mostly. i noticed pilling on the inside of the arms when
-1,"I love jumpsuits - except for this one. the fabric is blah. it's between plastic and the material that they make flags out of. the print is adorable and the buttons up the front are super cute. the tie thing that's just hanging there?  it's a tie thing that just hangs there. it doesn't  look good hanging  and it doesn't look good tied.  this jumpsuit had so much potential. i'm definitely disappointed.  for sizing reference  i am 5'5""  135  34c and a small was perfect."
0,I love this top because it can be worn on or off the shoulders and looks equally as cute either way  i bought the red color and it is super cheerful and perfect for summer. looks great with faded jeans. i love the poplin fabric  although the stitching quality is shabby and i expect this won't hold up long enough to wear again next summer. for the price i feel like it should be crafted a little bit better. i am narrow shoulder'd and bra size 36 b or c and while a medium might have fit me better o
-1,Noticed all the 5 star reviews online for the latest pilcro stets- so due to the past 2 years of dissapointment of what was once a great pair of jeans....i was hopeful that retailerpologist listened and went back to the original pilcro stet formula- thick denim  just the right amount of give and a flattering 10 inch rise. walked right in and found them- and i knew right when i touched them- they were still the thin denim that's nowhere near the quality they once were. consumers pay attention and t
1,This top is very flattering and the silver line details give it a great pop of color!
-1,Very disappointed. the cutouts started to rip the first time i wore it. i've only worn it twice and i love it but the cut outs are embarrassing.
0,I read prior reviews and decided to go forward with my purchase. i am so pleased that i did. the m fit nicely. the fabric is not as soft as i had wished. however  i think with wear it will become broken in.
-1,I've been waiting to purchase this top for some time  thinking it would be perfect weight for fall/winter. i'm pretty disappointed. since i don't live close to an retailer  i typically order a size up to avoid returns and usually end up with items that fit just right or a little loose which is no big deal  this sweater however i was swimming in  like a child in an adult sweater! it was huge! and not to mention unflattering on my short fuller shape. i wasn't impressed with the material either  it f
-1,This is a very slimming  well-made  nice fitting top-i just disliked the colors. they did not look good on me. otherwise this is a very nice piece!
0,Great item and very feminine. can be dressed up or down and fits true to size.
-1,Super itchy! had to return.
0,I tried this dress in an xs (my usual size) and it is tts. i love the fabric and pattern and the tiers of the dress are pretty. however  the color kind of washed me out and the neckline made the dress look matronly on me. i didn&#39;t get the dress and wished it worked out.
-1,Unfortunately the dress is pulling apart after the first wash ( gentle hand wash cycle). also  there are no bra-straps holders  and my bra straps did show up a lot...
1,An adorable tank...wearing it right now!  fits this curvy girl well  though may consider wearing a tank underneath  as the keyhole does show a bit of cleavage.  if in between sizes  consider sizing down.  perfect print for summer.
-1,The blouse is lovely - but after washing it exactly as specified  it shrank more than a full size. this is an expensive hand-me-down for my daughter...
1,This is such a cute top. perfect for fall layered with a sweater!
-1,First  the fabric is beautiful and lovely for spring and summer. i really wanted to like this top  but the fitting is so awkward for me. i typically where a 0/xs  and sized up in the shirt to a size 2. it was very tight and pulled funny across the chest (size 32/a). i also found the cut at the shoulders very narrow (need a strapless bra) and made it look unflattering overall. had to return this one back to the store.
1,These are the best leggings! they were so comfortable that i wore them all day and then to bed; i didn't want to take them off. i'm hoping to get a few more pairs.
0,This dress was as pretty in real life as the picture. flattering also. unfortunately it is definitely not appropriate for office work. even though it appears so in the picture  the back is very low cut and there is no way not for bra to show (unless you don't need one) also it was much tighter on top than the model picture  even though the rest fit perfectly.
-1,I sized way down and this top was still shapeless and tent-like. the sweatshirt fabric overpowered the cute  feminine details.
-1,"Loved this top online but when i tried it on it was shorter than expected so only fitting for high waisted bottoms and much more boxy than it appeared online. i wish to high heaven that this top came in a more ""normal"" cut. hip length and slimming  the fabric and collar are beautiful!"
0,This is a pretty jump suit  true to size  looked flattering on me  lovely soft tencel like fabric and pretty design fabric. however  the sides are cut too deep and it's impossible to wear a strapless bra or any kind of bra without the bra showing. i tried without one and that definitely doesn't work  so back it went to the store.
1,So i love this top. i got it in black and red. both are amazing and go with about anything. they run a bit large. i sort of forgot to read the label and thought it was just a cotton turtleneck. i threw it in the washer on regular settings and cold water and hung it to dry. i would say it shrunk 10% at most. beyond that  no difference. in fact  it fits better after it shrank since it was a bit big. obviously  if you do not dry clean this  you are going against manufacturer recommendations  but i
0,I have a love hate relationship with this product. it is comfortable and cozy  yet unshapely. after the initial wear  the product begins to stretch out  and if you sit for a while your knees are demarcated in the fabric once you stand. the sherpa front is soft  but the waffle material in the back is in no way flattering. i purchased for sleeping so it does that job nicely  but i would never leave the house with this on. i am hoping that after the first wash it shrinks a bit too. i am typically a
-1,I don't have a large head but i could barely squeeze this blouse over mine. i also ordered the xs even though i'm usually a small and it was still blousier than i would have liked. already returned it. on the plus side  it's gorgeous.
1,This is a flattering skirt for work or play. a few things to be aware of:   - it is a lightweight knit without a lining (would travel great and never need ironing)  - the waist is quite high   - the waist is quite slim (people with tummy self-consciousness might feel funny in it)  - the hang is flattering for people with butts and hips (such as myself)  - true to size for me    i decided not to keep it because i couldn't come up with enough tops to love it with and because for the money i would
0,This top is very pretty  but it doesn't make up for the problems with it. retailer seems to be suffering from quality issues as of late. the sizes are all over the place and items i have purchased don't seem to hold up to normal use and washing. i normally wear a medium in tops. the medium in this top was huge. i needed an extra small  which means a lot of people are sized out of this top. i hand washed this top in cold water as the tag indicated and it shrunk! it shrunk so much that i can
1,I stumbled upon the blue version in the store. i immediately liked that it was easy  chic  and just different-enough. after wearing it for a birthday dinner  i saw it online and realized that i had styled it almost exactly the same way the blue one is shown. black sandal wedges  silver cuff  silver earrings. it is flattering in an unexpected way  which may be partially because i am really small-chested. the front v is deep compared to what i usually wear  but double-sided tape easily kept my bra
1,"These pants are great. i am 5'6"" and 133lbs. i normally wear medium for athletic bottoms. medium fits well except knee pit area. maybe because they are not very stretching fabric. however  they are still flattering. the material was thick enough and their print hides underwear lines."
1,So glad i gave these a try last summer in the peachy pink color. this year  i got the darker grey. color is great- goes with so much-and they are so soft and comfortable. also love that these can work rolled up or down at the bottom
1,This coat is super yummy! i'm always in need of something stylish and warm at the same time. definitely was happy with the weight and lining on this garment.  *highlight: i always get compliments on it when i'm out.
-1,This dress would have been gorgeous and consistent with retailer's aesthetic if the designs had been embroidered onto a thick silk/jacquard fabric to give it texture  which is how it looks from the photo. obviously it would have been more expensive  but in any case  this was just a really expensive polyester dress  which it says in the product description  but i gave retailer the benefit of the doubt  thinking if anyone can make even polyester look like a quality product  it'll be retailer. but now i
-1,I probably should have gone with petite. this dress was just awful on. the waist was nowhere near where it was supposed to be. it hits me about thigh level. it's very unforgiving  clingy  and shows every bump. i found the material tolerable but if worn for long periods of time  i have a suspicion that it would begin to irritate my skin and be scratchy. it's going back.
0,I like the style and the design of this culottes  but the texture of the fabric will caught on any rough surface. i had a few loose loops for just one wear... so it will be nice to wear for work or shopping   but not good to go to the park or play with kids...
1,"This is a great summer maxi dress. i am 5'4"" 120lbs  about a size 4 in dresses  32dd. i got this in an extra small. i was really happy that on someone my height  it's just a few inches above my ankle  so did not shorten me at all. the straps were a good length  and the waist hit at the right spot. i don't think the waist detail not going all the way around is a big deal  there are the little snaps in the straps for your bra  and skirt is lined. the turquoise color is really pretty and the fabric"
1,"I bought this online in dark green after trying on the burgundy. i usually wear a medium (5'2""  120) but i looked better in the small in this jacket. the combination of very deep green  black and tan is beautiful. the cut is very flattering with the jacket open or snapped closed. it is nice enough to wear with black pants or skirt but looks just as good with jeans. i am in my 60's and this look is chic and fresh without being too ""young"" for my age. it's also very well made. i love it."
1,"This jumpsuit is cuter than it looks online. my store displayed it with a brown belt  which dresses it up. it is perfect for our hot summers with brown or silver sandals. i will wear it with a short sleeve white cotton tee. i'm 5' 7"" and bought the extra small. pricey but worth it  so stylish. so retailer!"
1,The material is soft. it looks perfect with ankle jeans or flare jeans.

-1,It is so cute in the picture but wasn't flattering on me. it also felt like i couldn't raise my arms while wearing it. i love retailer and will be a forever fan  but this dress just wasn't for me.
0,"This is a cute shirt  but it has slits at the bottom of the hem so that the front bottom of the shirt has this small rectangular ""flap."" it's not visible from the photo. i think it'll have to be returned for this reason."
1,I'm a 0/2 on top with 32d's and i purchased this top in a medium and it fit perfectly. pretty colors go with a mix of bottoms. design is both functional and attractive  which usually isn't the case with swimwear. love the underwire cups  adjustable ties and straps. and the fabric is really soft and comfortable.
-1,This whole order was disappointing. the main piece i ordered was cancelled and the two remaining items - this sweater included were poorly made. there was a snag/thread hanging out in the middle of the front of the sweater - tried to tuck it in but it wouldn't stay so i'll be returning it.
1,This jumpsuit has the best fit i could ever imagine for a jumpsuit. jumpsuits are always tricky for me  but this one fits like a dream. i would say it runs true to size  with the exception of being a little bit big in the chest. you could go braless with this jumpsuit as there are nice little cups for the girls  but i put on a strapless bra just to fill out the top part. that's not typically a problem for me being a 32d. i don't think i could size down though or it would be too tight in the wais
1,Absolutely stunning design with the eyelet lace top!  it's a very romantic  comfortable top that has a flattering fit. i'm so glad that it has lining so i don't need to be concerned about exposing myself to anyone.  it has a light fabric so it's very comfortable in the summer heat and humidity in florida.
0,Close but no cigar...  the design and color were cute.  the sweater itself was too warm for me  and itchy.  the top fit snugly in the chest and shoulders but it came out a little strangely at the bottom  it almost had strange fold in the front.  look closely at some of the photos and you'll see what i mean.  sadly it went back.
-1,Runs small. arms very short and hits in the wrong place across your chest. would not recommend.
-1,These run very small!! they are also short  almost like a crop pant. the fit was so weird that i won't even exchange for a bigger size.
0,I ordered these on sale despite a previous reviewer's comment that they were unflattering on the back side. they really do hug your bum  but that is not what bothers me. what bothers me is that the back side is totally see through  so unless you plan on wearing them with a long top  they are not wearable in public or around other people. i have gotten some of my favorite pieces from retailer  but also some of the most poorly designed. unfortunately  these fall in the latter category.
0,This top is really cute but shorter in length than expected.  plus  it shrunk considerably!
1,This is a heavier weight shirt. it is fitted through the bust and shoulders and very loose below so  if you don't like loose fitting clothes  this is not for you. it is well made and looks cute with jeans.
1,Love the lattice inserts  makes it feel like you have ventilation which is nice on a hot summer day. i purchased this in grey and in xs. i normally wear m for a looser fit  s for a more fitted look  so i was really surprised that an xs worked for me and was fitted. i haven't worn it since i washed it though. decided to buy the white but in a small  pretty but very see thru. will need to wear a shirt underneath  a little bummed because i liked the breeze! one other comment  this shirt is long! wh
-1,I was so bummed when this came in...the colors and print are beautiful  but the neck is super itchy because of an elastic/ruffle combo. there is also a liner which is a nice touch  but it's significantly shorter than the top layer which drove me nuts. definitely going back.
-1,I was expecting elbow-to-full-length sleeves and like a previous review noted  they were short. very weird look for a wrap. returned.
-1,I loved this shirt so much i bought it in 4 colors. however  two of them shrunk. i was very disappointed.
1,I ordered this in a large and its a super cute dress but this time the large ran super big! i usually wear a 10 so sometimes mediums are too small. i'm going to exchange it for a medium and see if that fits better. the beading detail is beautiful but just had too much fabric down below.
1,I ordered the ivory in size xl. it is such a cute  comfortable top. all of the details are well-done. the quality of the material is great too. it's a flowy fit. after washing & air-drying  it does shrink a bit. great tee for summer!
0,This skirt ran short  small  and boxy. if you can get the right fit  the skirt is great quality and super cute  but i recommend trying on in store for sizing.
1,This dress is absolute perfection. the quality of the dress is great  the fit is comfortable and it's such a fun summer dress. the slip underneath fits perfectly the outer layer is delicate yet durable.
0,Purchased the gray patterned top. seemed to fit tts  but it didn't fit me. i'm an athletic build with a 34d bust and it just wouldn't fit right around the shoulder/neck area. i'm pretty confident it would fit someone who is less busty than i. the double-sided fabric was soft and felt like it would wash/wear very well. nice length all around...top and sleeves.
-1,This top is so lovely  but runs soo big. i ordered it online and was so surprised when i tried it on at home. i'm normally a size 14  and i was positively swimming in this top. hoping to exchange for a petite sm.
1,I love the fabric  since it's fall wasn't expecting it to be light. but its not heavy either. just the right balance.  this is one of those classics. i love the collage like pattern of the fabric.  the fit is true to size and looks great with bootie/boots. (dressed up or down).
-1,This jacket looked adorable on. it was also quite comfortable. however  it sheds and left fuzz on every dark surface it touched. sadly  this is a deal breaker for me.
-1,This top looked so cute in the picture  but unfortunately doesn't live up to it! the one i received  actually has the print shown in the photo on the inside of the shirt. it makes it much darker  and boring. the shirt itself is on the short side  and would've looked better if it hit lower on the hips  there's just too much fabric for it to land higher than that.
-1,"So i bought this  even after seeing the other reviews. because i love the designer and their things are normally cute and different. this fits just as others describe. it was not flattering to me at all  5""2. had to go back."
0,Bought this shirt in mid-july  washed twice (cold  delicate) and hung to dry. already holes/falling apart
1,I purchased this shirt in black. luckily  it was on sell. it can be dressed up or dressed down. it's so easy to just throw this on with skinny pants or jeans. i got it on sale too. i just hope that i can keep it for years since it will always be in style.
0,I got this top in my typical size medium and wanted to love it...it is such a good idea and i loved it on the model! however  it failed in translation for me  and i will be returning. the bottom of the top is very loose  but the top clings to my chest (36dd)  pulling awkwardly and gapping on the sides. not worth exchanging for a large  since the bottom of the top is already to loose..
1,I love the fabric  texture mix and length of this top. i gave it a four stars because my usual size is a medium but had to go with a large. a medium felt a bit too snug through the shoulders. very happy with this top and look forward to wearing it a lot.
-1,I was very excited about ordering this top as i'm tall girl (6 ft) and i like my back well covered. i liked both style and design of the top on photo but when the package arrived i was very disappointed with the material. this top is incredibly thin and see through. though fabric is nice and soft  it feels more like a pajama top. all curves & bumps immediately stand out and it doesn't look flattering. i ordered 2 colors grey and black size large and returned both  although they were true to size
1,I'm always scared of rompers because of my height and long legs. but this one was perfect. it didn't ride up or hit in a weird spot on the hips. it's very flattering.
-1,I was excited to see this top  ordered it and was disappointed. it was too tight across the chest and had too much fabric around the bottom. i tried this on 3 times hoping for i had been wrong in previous assessments- no luck.
1,I've been looking for dresses to wear to nurse in since i just had a baby & so i bought this dress knowing it just had a tack holding the front fold together & always intending to remove the tack. i love it. the fabric is super soft. i wear it with a nursing tank underneath and a wide belt to cinch my waist & it's amazing. with the tack in  it did pull very strangely across the bust as others have mentioned  so it's not good for a big bust unless you intend to remove the tack & wear something un
-1,This dress is very thick cotton material. like a sweatshirt. i was hoping to wear this to a wedding but it is a tunic at best. the bell part of the sleeves also stick out awkwardly because of the fabric.
-1,I bought these a great alternative to black jeans but they are headed back.  the texture is nice but let's call them what they are- thin  leggings.  not worth the price in my opinion.  honestly  i can't seem to find a pair of pilcros that i like so i'd spent the extra money on a better pair of black jeans.
-1,I saw this sweater online and have been looking for a unique sleevless sweater for some time now. its a very beautiful sweater so i ordered it right away when i saw this design. i recieved the sweater in the mail and really wanted to love it but it just wasn't for me. its very well made and thick which i liked but i usually fit in small sized tops for retailer but they didn't have a small left in the sizes  i ordered a medium and it still ran small  i was very surprised. its was also disappointing
0,This model looks like a bauble head. she is absolutely too thin and sends the wrong message out to retailer shoppers. this last catalog's models are anorexic and unhealthy looking.    i ordered this shirt hoping it would fit  but it's too small for 34dd. i am tall athletic and have breasts.   i think of my shape as average - and the top didn't fit. it's cut narrow and small.
0,"I bought the rose and the sapphire during the xtr 40% off clearance. i'm just under 5'4""  curvy & usually wear med petite in retailer dresses. i ordered a mr because  being sale items  only regular sizing was available. a sp would have been much better! the dress hit about 3"" below my knee and the crisscross top made my bust look matronly. a snugger fit would have been sexier. the rose was darker than pictured & pretty  but eh on me. however  the sapphire was gorgeous. i'm sad about returning it."
-1,I bought a pair of these in stone and after the first wash they become all splotchy. i chalked it up to perhaps there was bleach leftover in the my washer. although nothing else in the load was blotchy. i then  because i loved the cut of these pants  bought another pair in the darker blue color. the same thing happened after the first wash. again  nothing else in that wash load was the least bit ruined -- just my new retailer pants! such a bummer-- definitely a dye issue. i called the stores i pur
1,Just bought this weekend and had to size down. i'm usually a small in jackets and went with the xs. retailer has had this style for the last few years and i've missed out so finally was able to buy before they sold out!! well worth the price point. i think it will be a very versatile jacket. for sizing reference i'm 5'7 and 135lbs.
0,I got this dress in hopes of having a really nice winter formal dress. it was not well made at all! the lining didn't line up with the top layer and the waist puffed out in uneven places. i am curvy so a puffy waistline in the last thing i need! the fabric itself is very nice  but just not well made. i do not recommend this dress.
1,"I saw this online and said to myself  next time you are in the retailer store look for this dress. i am glad i did! i bought the neutral dress (off white tan.black) because i knew it would go with everything and most occasions. i am 5'6""  136 pounds  the small fit me perfect! in retailer dresses i am between a small/med. the top of the dress is lined and form fitting which is a plus. the off white coored section does go across the chest so one must wear a neutral colored lined bra even though the to"
-1,This tank (in black) is nice quality  most of the fringe hangs straight and seems to be attached well. it's just too short and too boxy for my figure (curvy/hips). would look good on someone who has straight hips and is not long waisted. since that doesn't describe me  it has to go back.
0,While i love the green color and the soft waffle knit of this top it was so wide i could have fit two of me standing side by side into it!  i mean it was truly laughable!  don't know what the manufacturer was thinking but this one needs to go back to the drawing board.
0,I wanted to love it - the color is great  the embroidery pretty  but the stiff scalloped sleeves were just too much. if you have broad shoulders this is not the shirt for you. i think personally it would have been better had the material been softer.
1,"I was expecting to love this based on the reviews and my prior experience with this brand  but i'm a little unsure. the front part hangs a bit too low on my 5'4"" frame  yet i think a petite would have the slits too high on the sides. i'm just not sure it hangs right on me. it's fitted through the arms and shoulders nicely  and looks great with the front loosely tucked. just not what i was expecting."
0,Would have loved this skirt  but the xl is closer to a size 12 than a 14 or 16. larger ladies beware!
0,Love this top   although it ran very small in bust and arms   i'm normally a medium will have to return for a large!
-1,"I didn't receive a jacket. i received a very expensive cardigan sweater with no structural qualities to it. jackets have some structure to them. for example they might nip in at the waist a bit. this cardigan doesn't do that. it hangs in a very boxy shape. the quality is great. very light weight and i really love the little pockets and details  but i don't need/want another cardigan.     i'm 5'5""  118 lbs and got a small. the small seemed big  but i think it would have fit fine if it had more st"
1,"The attention to detail in aligning the pattern is excellent as always with this brand.  .  i tried a size 2 and it fit fine  just above my long waist ( 5'2""  currently 33-25-37.5 with narrow hips and fuller thighs). i have several other cartonnier shorts in sizes 0 and 2  depending on my weight  and these fit similarly. i think the size 2 petite would be a bit lower but it's sold out now.  .  the only reason i passed was that the fabric has a polyester fusible interfacing so that it keeps its s"
-1,This dress comes with a built in fupa. literally there is extra material at the lower abdomen that sticks out and is very unflattering.
-1,I was drawn to this top because of the interesting and detailed straps  which are embroidered with a lovely triangle pattern. however the embroidery takes away any stretchy-ness or give in the cotton and makes the top a beautiful but ill-fitting harness for anyone with any breasts or full-figured lusciousness. the worst part is that the top hem along the top is embroidered and rigid just like the straps  so it feels like you are wearing an uncomfortable strapless top. i wanted to keep this but h
0,"I love this dress  i mean it si really pretty in person  however  the breast area is just too small... i can't wear a bra with it  and my ""older"" breasts just droop  not flattering. they are barely covered... i am a bit disappointed at that  but if you are smaller up there  i say give it a try... i am 115 lbs  26.5 ion waist  30dd and xs petite was great everywhere but chest.    colors and fabric are great  i love that the different colors are different types of fabric... too bad."
0,These pants are adorable as pajamas or maybe something very casual to wear to the beach  but they honestly do not seem like something that a grown woman would wear in public. they are good quality and fit nicely  but i feel like if you're over 20  they're not really flattering or especially appropriate.
1,I ordered this top in xs and blue  its subtle but pretty on  as the style gives it a boost. it is a bit snug in the shoulders (cut a little snug in armpit?) but i would not want it larger. it does not affect the appearance  is not uncomfortable  just noticeable when moving arms around. nice fall top  want to try with blue or white jeans and boots.
-1,Oh how i love moth sweaters but wow was this one a disappointment. the color is wonderful  the shape is unique and the stitch work is lovely but that's where the compliments end. it's an itchy  cheap feeling acrylic that is too short for my torso. i am truly disappointed that at this price point it was such a cheap feeling piece. so bummed. so so bummed.
1,This is a wonderful vest! i love the lining!! keeps you nice and warm! i love the muted green color! the pockets are sewn closed but can be cut open at the stitching without ruining the vest!!
0,I loved this dress and after i got it on. as others mentioned  it is difficult to get it on. i wish that the bow snapped on and off. as i took the dress off the bow came off itself. unfortunately going to be returning the dress.
1,I was immediately drawn to this top in the catalog. when my local retailer had it in stock and in my size  i tried it on. it fit so well - the front wasn't too low and the back was fantastic with its multiple straps. i wore it the same week to a dinner with friends. i like the multiple prints and the navy blue edging. i bought the turquoise necklace too because it topped off the look so well. the fabric is silky but washable. the top is very well made and fun to wear.
0,This lift weight cardigan is true to size  perfect for fall or spring. colors are quite nice  especially the little pops of orange.
-1,Why is it so difficult to find a shirt that doesn't expose half of my bra if i lift my arm?     this is cute (beyond the arm hole issue) but overpriced. going back.
1,I love the style and quality of this blouse. it can easily be dressed up or down. the blouse is completely see through and delicate. still  it is so romantic  feminine  distinctive and timeless.
-1,The sides scooped up a bit too much on me. i was hoping to be able to tuck this into a skirt and wear to work  but there were definitely some gaps that showed the side of my midriff. back it goes. :(
1,Paige jeans are obviously known for their luxurious feel and amazing fit. these jeans are the best new addition to your collection. the perfect high rise and not as extreme flair  these might beat out your skinny jeans for your nights out. they do come extremely long  so they will most likely need to be hemmed. i get huge compliements when i wear them and told how they compliement my legs in the best way. if you're debating on whether to jump onto the flair trend  i'd go with these!
1,I tried on the grey motif yesterday  and it was the one thing i tried on that i loved  and the only thing i bought. i'm 5'4 34 dd 125 lbs  and the xs was a perfect fit for me. i sometimes find that retailer stuff is tight in the arms  so i generally wear a small  but i tried on the small  and the arms were a bit baggy. i plan on wearing tanks underneath  so the xs was the right call. if you want to wear something thicker & long sleeved underneath  go with your usual size.
0,The design of these is adorable with the lace up ties however they are a dingy looking off white color. they are also pretty see through. returned.
0,"I do not love these pants. while the fabric is nice  they make me look rather dumpy. i highly recommend the essential taper pant instead  which has beautiful tapering legs and made me look more slender. these pants make me look like i've put on 20 pounds and they also make me look rather squat. perhaps they would look good on someone tall  but at 5' 6"" these are a miss for me!"
1,Love these! loose and comfy everywhere. delighted to have found a 32  and delighted that they are roomy  even at the waist. i exchanged another pair of pilcro's and was afraid of a shipping/pricing conflict  but as usual  retailer customer service was excellent. earlier sale price was honored  easy returns in the orignal shipping bag..   retailer design  fashion and company attitude excels!
0,Strange fit if you have a short torso. i ordered a medium petite and the drop waist looked strange  so i tried using a belt and it bunched up. returned the dress. why should a nice simple dress like this create such hard work?!
0,I wanted to give this a glowing review but i ended up returning this cardigen. the folds on top added too much to my frame. i do not suggest this for heavier apple shapes. for all others  it is incredibly soft and warm. the tan color was weird but they others are simply gorgeous.

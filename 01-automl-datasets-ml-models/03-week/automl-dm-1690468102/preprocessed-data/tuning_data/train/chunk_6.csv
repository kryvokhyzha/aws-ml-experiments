-1,The bra is comfortable and the design is good. however  the sizing is way off. i am a 34c and the small fits well with minimal support. not sure about quality. this one might have to go back :(
1,Very cute top. the sleeves were more quarter length on me. looks great with jeans
0,The dress has a flattering cut and is a nice color. but  the fabric looks like old  matted carpet. i will be returning.
1,"Was so glad i gave this dress a chance - it's adorable! it does run large. i am 5'6""  125lb and the 2 fits perfectly. it is super comfortable. i am taking away a star only because it doesn't have pockets - with all of the fabric - how were pockets left out?"
-1,Ok ladies....you need to know that this type of fabric is the one that will get holes (i bought the white one). it is super thin and lovely  but i was only able to get two wears out of it. i did wash it and it maintained it's size because i restretched it while wet then hung to dry. i was super disappointed about the wear but appreciated being able to return it without question at my local retailer.
0,I recommend with reservations. these leggings are 100% wool  soft  not itchy  light weight  lovely knitted pattern. they run large. i sized down to a small. the first time i wore them they were fine. but the second time the waist stretched out and was useless: they were falling down as i walked. such a shame because everything else about them is perfect for cold winter days. they even fit under my silk skirt and would make other lighter garments wearable in winter. so what to do? at the price th
1,"Love this with leggings or jeans for a casual look. quality seems ok  though i'm hoping for no shrinkage after i wash since it's the perfect length at the moment (i'm 5'7"" and it just covers my butt). good sale purchase!"
0,"This top came down to my hip bones  but i am short-waisted. the shirt definitely fits shorter than in the photo. the measurements listed for ""regular"" seem to be a bit shorter than the 26"" l measurement i got when i measured it. i think the quality is nice  and though it could likely easily snag if you're not one who is used to wearing delicate clothing  i didn't find this top to be flimsy at all. for reference i purchased a l and the fit is more form-fitting on me than it is on the model  but n"
-1,I have purchased a lot from retailer but lately  some of the items have been disappointing in quality.verses cost  this being one. the picture is nice but the actual blouse is nothing like this. the size was not accurate so buy a size bigger because of the sleeves.
-1,This is a sweet top as it is shown. on the model it appears there is a panel behind the lace on the front of the top. this is not so-the entire front of the top is see through. one would need to wear a camisole. the material on the blouse is very sheer-it appears to be rather cheap actually. if you are wearing a top this sheer it does not make sense to have a camisole on underneath. that said you are going to be able to see your bra and skin down to your belly button if you do not have a camisol
1,This shirt is super soft and comfortable! luckily it's a good length and not at all short!
-1,The dress is just ok. i cannot imagine having paid full price for this. i got it for florida vacation. i put it on to wear to church first and spilled a drop of lavender oil on it and it stained!!!! cant get it out. thats punk for a dress that even on sale is like.   sending back
1,The is such a cute a-line skirt and perfect for the summer with a white tee. i bought the moss color and the rose gold buttons on it look really pretty. i'm 5'1  103 pounds and bought the 00 regular since i did not want to go too short with the petite size. it does run slightly big so order a size down if you have a smaller waist. love this and the price!
1,Fit is boxy yet flattering and material is sheer but not overly delicate. took my usual size four  i am moderately short waisted.
-1,"I anticipated receiving this skirt as i love a longer pencil skirt and this looks beautiful. i opened it  tried it on  sent it back...it is well made but has too many negatives. first  it is very thick. i ordered size 6 (5'2""  140 lbs.). the size was good  but it is so thick that it adds lots of extra fluff around the waist and abdomen. it is also very stretchy and fits in an unflattering way. finally  and most importantly  it has a back and front vent and both are vented all the way up to the c"
0,I ordered an xl because most retailer button ups i need a 12 and sometime 14 due to my shoulders and chest but this was huge.
0,May look better on someone tall. thin  and straight.
-1,I was very shocked to receive this dress with a rusty zipper  looks like crusty white rust . see attached pictures. the dress fabric is very nice and i did try it on and it is a very nice fit  lined with a little stretch but my gosh what a cheap poor quality zipper that looks like it was old and exposed to moisture because the metal parts have a white crusty substance! retailer you really need to check your merchandise before sending to your loyal customers. lately the quality has been declining a
1,I tried this shirt and really loved the feel  and the scalloped sleeves. i have a couple shirts by this brand that also have beautiful embroidery  and i always find myself drawn to their clothing. the fit wasn't too boxy on me  but i'm between m&l  and sized down  so that might have helped. if i didn't have so much of this color in my wardrobe already i probably would have snatched this up!
-1,The sweater material was fragile. there were already two picks in the fabric when it arrived. i felt like it would not wear or wash well. i was also disappointed in the shaping or how it hung on my body. i am returning the sweater.
-1,The zipper broke on this piece the first time i wore it. very disappointing since i love the design. i'm actually going to try to replace the zipper myself with something stronger  but annoying that it's come to that.
0,"The double seams down the front of this elongate; the material is light and would work spring through summer  kind shape. even though the dress hits below the knee  the buttons end mid thigh and make it cute rather than matronly. here's the but:  the rib cage area is very fitted. i'm a 6-8  in pretty good shape  and that is not a ""problem area"" for me. however  in this dress  it was. there was no way for my figure to pull it off. from behind  in both 6 and 8  every bundle of skin seemed ample. i"
0,This top is just as beautiful in person as online. however  it has two issues for me. 1. it is too short. this might work if you have a short torso  but it would forever show my stomach. 2. the fabric has way too much static cling. no matter what i tried  it just clung to my stomach and flared out at the sides. not attractive. in short  if you have a short torso and don't mind battling the static  this truly is a beautiful top.
0,Beautiful sweater coat! love that is easy to pop on & head out. i did have to go to a seamstress and have the button moved as it was to large and boxy around my waist area.
1,I have received so many compliments. it's my favorite
-1,"This ran a bit small; i'm normally a 2  this was a 4 and 'just' fit. the pattern was very 'digi ' the length was shorter than i hoped (i'm 5'1"")  and the fabric  while structured  was just cheap and acrylic-feeling. pass."
1,"This dress is so much better in person! i got the petite size (i am 5'2"") and it seems to run a bit smaller than the regular size- i have a fairly large bust so i went up a size and it seems to fit perfectly. love the colors and vintage design! i can't wait to wear it for a wedding i will be attending!"
-1,This top is too short  so much so that tucking it in would be difficult. the designs are lovely  but the short length is putting this top back on the rack.
-1,For the price of this dress  i was expecting something decent. the style is cute  but nothing more. however  the type of the polyester that the dress is made of.... oh my. it is a thick unpleasant material  that will cling to a body when it is hot. i never came across an item at retailer that was made this cheaply.  the tag on the back was hanging at half and the button on the front was ready to come off before i even tried this dress on.  no need to say - it's going back asap.  you should not sel
0,"I'm 5'9"" and these run true to size for the fit but having long legs by the end of the day they start to sag down in the crotch and hit me about mid calf straight out is the package. they wash up perfectly and are cozy. if you're of average height these will probably be your favorite."
1,I love the neckline on this - sharp enough for work  but cute for a fun night out too. only complaint is it's soooo flowy on the bottom. i could hide a baby under here for sure. i got the medium thank goodness or it would have been ridiculous. i'm 5'8  160lbs. great for fall.
0,I really wanted to love this. i kept refreshing the page so that i could order it as soon as my size was in stock. i love the colors and struggle to find cute dresses in natural fabrics for the summer. unfortunately as another reviewer mentioned the cut of the arm holes is strange. it cut my off in the most unflattering spot.
0,Really love this sweater. i am pretty crushed i'm returning it. the flair below the waist is too much. the quality is wonderful  the color lovely  the style great- i wore it around the house and every time i caught a mirror  it just was too much material  too big a bell shape. oh well  still looking for the sweater for winter 2016/17.
1,I have the blue color of this top and i love the color variation throughout. it looks very unique and it is going to be a great piece for late summer/early fall. the pleated look on the upper chest is very flattering and adds texture to the top. i am pleased with my purchase!
1,T.la got it right this time. love the fabric. the color is perfect for summer and the color is a great shade of green. exactly as pictured. the left side has a slight cut with silver buttons. exactly as it looks on line. i certainly recommend this top. love it.
-1,This shirt smelled so bad when i received it (and i am not at all sensitive to smells). is it from the dye?   i tried it on anyway. it is shapeless and nothing special. at almost 80 bucks it is so over priced.
0,I've rarely met a maeve item i didnt like. initially looking at this dress i thought it was suede but it's a structured cotton  making it a little more stiff than i'd like. i feel that making it suede would've been perfect for this dress. i am 5'2 140 lbs. usually a 4-6  i tried on the 6 and it was a great fit except for the chest area (34d) and the butt/hips area  making this dress a little less shift and a little baggy in the abdominal region. i then tried on the 8 and it was way too big all a
1,I love this dress! good for work or social occasions. flowy fabric  and not boxy. the length is perfect  not too short.  i can't wait to wear it. picture is accurate as to color.
-1,This is a beautiful shirt. the back is a few inches longer than the front which makes for a cool effect.  the only thing that i didn't like about this shirt was how fragile the buttons on the back are. i was taking this shirt off and one popped off. when i went to hang it  another one popped off! so i had to return it. such a shame.
-1,Beautiful dress  but has an unflattering fit. i purchased an xs and it's past my knees and the bottom of the dress is so heavy! would be a perfect maternity dress though!
1,I have absolutely nothing negative to say about this shirt. it's comfortable  the fit is excellent and flattering  and it can be dressed up or down depending on the occasion. i bought it in the brown and the black and have no regrets.
-1,I waited three months for these pants. when they finally arrived  i was mostly pleased. they seemed like the staple pant everyone is raving about. and they should have been.  problem one: they bag out. i got one wear out of them before i needed to wash and hang to dry (regained shape then).  problem two: the crotch split! in the front! i'm a teacher. i sincerely hope no one noticed! i read other reviews about this problem and don't know if i got a bad batch or if a similar fate is awaiting other
-1,This was so unflattering. the bust was too high so it hit me weird on the boobs. the green was a beautiful  vibrant color but the fabric is so delicate that one wrong move would cause a snag.
1,I've worn this shirt approx 3 times to work. each time someone comments on how much they like it. i'm attempting to add more color to my workwear. this shirt tends to swing so much i feel exposed. that is the biggest drawback.
0,I saw this dress in the store and absolutely fell in love with the fabric and just had to have it. i ordered it on line in my size and when it arrived  i tried it on (or tried to try it on) and it didn't fit some parts of my bday (mainly in the bust). i ordered the largest size  so there was no where to go from there except to send it back. others here have complained about a strange fit in the tummy area (i.e.  too much material). i never got to find out because i really couldn't get the dress
0,This dress is stunning  no doubt - a shimmering forest green under a black teardrop motif  thick material  nicely cut  with pocket panels that are forgiving to a belly. however  the fact that this dress has zero stretch (which is fine  if that's what you're looking for)  coupled with what is quite possibly the cheapest zipper ever manufactured  make this dress exhausting to put on. i'm normally a 14/16 at retailer  and i ordered the 16 just to be safe  and the waist is exactly the size of my waist
0,Bells out to much i had to send it back
0,This top has a really pretty pattern and is good quality  but was just too boxy for me. i also felt like the sleeves were a little odd/big.     the fit is tts  though slightly shorter then it looks on the model.
1,I bought this top in 2 colors. it was endlessly comfortable and easy to wear  so i bought it in the 3rd color. it's so versatile that i found myself trying to wear it in too many situations - travel  weekends  and work. the feel of the fabric is gorgeous  but it pills after wear. so when the top went on sale  i bought an extra set of all 3 colors. now i have a set for play and a set for work. i love this shirt.
0,These are absolutely beautiful pants. soft and wearable right away  but the other reviewer is right. if you are average or short  these will be way too long. they won't even look like cropped pants  just regular wide leg jeans. i am keeping them b/c i love the look and i will also have them altered to be shorter. it's disappointing that these were designed for the statuesque instead of the other 90% of us  especially considering the amazingly high price for a pair of jeans. so... i guess i am di
-1,I tried on this sweater...love the flowing top  and it looked like the seam would hit right under my bustline.  wrong.  the seam came right across my bust on a medium; sized up to a large  same thing. this shouldn't happen! not sure who this would actually flatter.  the sweater is high quality  and the colors are perfect. the fit needs work.
1,I bought this in aqua. the color is beautiful. the quality of the cashmere is great. i have worn this 3 times since purchasing! this can be dressed up or down. the cowl neck is not overwhelming and looks great with a shorter chunky necklace or even a scarf. flattering hem line. very versatile.
-1,In a word .. clingy ... and not in good way. long so you need it to flow not cling. liked the back  but front was just too clingy. back it goes.
-1,I ordered online. i sized up one size. it fit perfect. so flattering and so pretty. then i tried to take it off and the zipper stuck...badly. 30 minutes later i was sadly packing it up to ship back. the zipper is that awful.
-1,"I'm 5'7""  130 lbs. i ordered a medium-regular. the dress fell three inches above my knees. this model is taller than i am  and it falls to her knees....doesn't make sense. i think retailer sends petites in place of regular."
-1,"But like other reviewers said  it looks nothing like the picture of the model. i am 5'3"" and 110 lbs  i usually wear an xs in maeve and i ordered the xs petite - the straps are not adjustable so the top part of the dress is up too high and then there is just so much material  it looks like i'm 6 months pregnant. and i usually love loose dresses like this  but the way this falls really does make you look like you are hiding a sack of potatoes. so bummed  because the material is beautiful and i lo"
0,I think in general it is just hard to buy a bathing suit online  but i really underestimated the v-neck of this suit. i read the reviews and noted it was not recommended for girls with larger size breast. as i'm basically an a cup  i figured i would be fine. the top portion basically has no coverage or hold. even when tied very tight  the top still opened making me feel exposed and like my entire breast would fall out of the suit. needless to say my fiancã© was not a fan of the suit either. even
0,I have a mixed feeling about this cardigan.  on one hand  i like it; on the other hand  there are some minor things i do not like.  first  i love its knit pattern; especially the pattern on the back.  second  i like a soft color of this cardigan.  on website pictures  two motifs look almost the same.  in reality  brown motif is light pink-ish while blue motif is light blue-green-ish.  third  texture.  this cardigan is made of linen and cotton  so it feels comfortable to wear.  if there are flaws
0,Lovely fabric  color and embellishment but this shirt was so long i can't even imagine wearing it over leggings.  i felt like i was wearing a dress.  there are too many cute tops on the market to bother having this one tailored (i don't buy sewing or ironing).    disappointed.
0,It seems like most people love this tee  so you might as well. i returned it because i didn't like how the front hung. if the front was as long as the back  i would have kept it. or  if the front was short enough to wear with thick pants  untucked  i might have kept it (seems like this top would only look good with leggings or skirts). i do like the material  though. it's very thin and looks great in the shoulder and neck area. and i liked how the back of the shirt looked when i tried wearing it
1,This is a lovely dress. it is on the heavy side and lined  so i would not recommend for hot summer wear. but the material and style are adorable. the skirt is definitely a-line  not sheath  but i prefer that. it runs a tad too tight in the chest  so if you're between sizes in the bust  i'd order up. that said  a 6 would be too big for me. i'm 5'4  120 lbs and 34c and usually wear a 4.
1,This is a great light  free flowing top for the summer. i agree with the other reviewers that the top section hits in a weird area  but if you are small busted  you won't be affected. it can be dressed up or down with jewelry and offers a whimsical option to a plain white blouse for the summer!
1,This is soft to the touch and just beautiful.  it is a little roomy  but true to size. i love it that way.   totally on trend for the season
1,This lovely skirt absolutely hits the mark for quality. it is a substantial weight for fall  a deep vivid blue color  and just the right length to wear with boots.  it was a trifle snug in the waist. i would have kept it anyway  but the oversized pockets stuck out on either side in an awkward way.  at this price  it just wasn't right for me.
0,This is a beautiful sweater and a nice medium weight. however  it is an awkward length. i am tall and have a long torso so it's just not cut right for me and was not flattering.
0,I was excited about this dress because i love the colors and print. the dress has no shape though and not in a good way. it's not flowy enough for the look of a shape dress but its not fitted enough to be flattering.
1,This top is extremely well made. the fabric is so soft. the style is very stylish. it is very figure flattering and chic. a keeper! i'm petite and the style is not overwhelming.
1,I got this in the red and the black.i returned the red for it doesn't compare to the black one.i would have loved it if it was a red dress with white flowers.i didn't like it being a white dress with red flowers.the black one is the one to pick!
1,Count me in as a five star lover of this dress! the details are so rich and interesting  so be prepared to get noticed when wearing. i'm happy to say that getting the size medium regular (instead of petite) was a good choice for my top heavy frame. the chest is fitted but not tight  the length is a not-too-short above knee  the tiered layers swing so nicely  and the beads/sequins add a touch is whimsy to the design. my one negative is the tassels at the neck tie--soo heavy cumbersome to style. o
0,I wanted to love this set  but sadly it just didn't fit as i had hoped. the small was bigger than expected and looked frumpy and not sexy. returned.
-1,This is a beautiful vest. i love the color-blocking  the modern and structured style  and its versatility.  i bought it with a defective item discount because there were some stains. i promptly took it to the dry cleaners and was informed that the black would bleed onto the white paneling if they did a full wash. they spot-cleaned it  and it did bleed. although the tag says to dry clean this baby  the black dye will bleed to the white fabric. i'll be taking it back into the store today for a ref
-1,I fell in love with this dress but when i received it in the mail  i was really surprised to see that unlike the picture online  the slip underneath is a nude color. it fit well and i decided to keep it. i wore it for the first time today and felt great in it. i was driving with my son in the back seat  i turned to hand him something and the entire right side of the dress (where the crocheting is) ripped open!! i cannot believe how poor the quality is at this price!

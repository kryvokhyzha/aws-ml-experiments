0,I really liked the color and style of this dress  but the proportions were off. the top was too small and the waist was too large. if you are more uniform in size/shape and less of an hourglass this dress may be perfect for you!
1,I received this dress as a gift and it has become such a great addition to my wardrobe! i love that i can wear it to work and then out with friends. a great value if you're looking for one special piece that you can get miles out of - you can wear the two pieces separate or together. i love floral and felt this non traditional take on a floral was very refreshing.
0,I ordered the stress in an xl. i usually wear a size 12 in most retailer clothes. the pattern and the flow of the dress is very beautiful but it runs extremely small. also  i felt that i was choking. it is better suited for thin women.
0,This skirt runs very large--even in the petite line. there was also no shape to the skirt (at least as it looked on my body). the color was nice (in the pink-grapeish hue)  but ultimately the skirt just looked like a tent on my body (00p).
-1,I was able to get this on sale. when it arrived  it was missing half of the rhinestones. i am very surprised that this top would be sent out this way. it also was missing the little bag with extra stones. i'm reaching out and wondering if anyone else has experienced this and is there a store that sells rhinestones like the one on the blouse? any help from anyone would be appreciated. i hate to part with this  but where was quality control?
0,Super cute  flattering design but the material is itchy so it's going back:(
1,Very pretty dress! wearing it for a family beach portrait. it may run a little big but not terribly. it is also not super long as pictured. i'm 5'6 and it's perfect with a flat.
1,"I bought this blouse at the store today and i love it! they stylist brought it for me to try on with the green chinos and it was perfect. it will go with jeans or dark pants as well. very unique and flattering! i got a size 2. i'm 5'7'"" and 130 pounds."
-1,Even on sale  this was just too pricey for what it is  which is a glorified tank. i liked the straps  but it hangs very wide off your chest.
-1,I disliked this dress. it didn't fall on me the way it falls on the model pictured. i think it would work well for tall  thin women with a smaller chest. i am petite with a larger chest  and it accentuated my chest in an unflattering way and managed to make me look frumpy at the same time. not recommended for petite women.
0,Cute shirt but no worth full price for sure. runs small in the bust. and i am not busty at all. definitely order up a size. i am returning mine  however  because of size and price.
-1,I thought this top would be a little more form fitting than it is. there is so much extra fabric near the bottom it is almost like a swing style top. the fabric will most definitely snag  as it is not a linen or cotton top material but rather a silky type and also very thin - not very good quality. i got the smallest size possible and it was absolutely huge  everywhere but the neck.
1,"These ""jeans"" definitely look more like pants and are very snug  but stretchy. i'm 5'10 and ordered the tall  and mine are a little longer than shown on the model. they look nice on  but are a tad tighter than i anticipated."
1,"This is such an easy dress to wear and it looks very polished! it is not a ""cheap polyester"" fabric as one reviewer wrote. it is a rayon and nylon blend. it does wrinkle easily. i love that the belt is actually sewn into the dress at the back. i don't typically gravitate toward warm color palette  but the burnt orange color is really lovely. it can be dressed up or down very easily. and it has pockets! i typically wear xs in retailer brands  and the size 0 fit me well."
-1,Darling jacket/coat  similar styling as the beige with big flowers and lace-up back that i bought a few years ago and still love. i was considering this one  but the description says to hand wash. seriously? a coat? that's simply not practical. not sure if i will buy this one.
0,The tee is adorable in the floral print. the fit is true to size  as it is a casual tee rather than overly fitted. the cuffed sleeves are a nice detail. i would have bought this at full price  but it is quite see through in the white/yellow floral. i could easily see my nude colored bra and even my belly button it was so sheer. having to wear a tank underneath this completely defeats the purpose of a cute  casual tee you can just throw on. i was so disappointed that it was so sheer. i think the
0,Bought this shirt because i loved the cut and the stripes. had little to no shape to it. some may think it runs big but it appears that is the look this top is going for. i feel like being short  i just looked kind of dumpy on me. fabric is nice but borders on see through. it was just ok....nothing exciting.
-1,I am now the third person to try this dress and return it for the same reason. the empire waist is too high and hits across the bust instead of underneath it. i can't imagine how they got it to fit this model so well. i am petite and i really love the idea of a maxi with sleeves  so i decided to try it even through the two previous reviewers reported this issue. unfortunately  i had the same problem. i am a c+ cup size. perhaps this would work on a very thin figure with a small bust. i ordered t
1,Loving this jumpsuit! i normally a medium top small bottom i bought the medium it fits right. soft fabric and nice color.
-1,Purchased this item on sale-received it and it had two huge holes on the side.not possible to repair. very disappointed in lack of quality control. :(
-1,I've been wearing this very comfortable and cute coat for 2 weeks. it is already tearing at the seams somehow. the quality of this is very poor.
0,This dress caught my eye online and i had to have it. when it arrived it was still just as pretty as i remembered. beautiful  vibrant colors and a unique oversized floral on a flirty  swishy fabric. unfortunately the cut was really strange. after reading several reviews i went with an xs  but i'm not sure a s would have solved all the fit problems i was having. while everything from the waist down fit perfectly  the arms were cut too tight  the chest was huge and yet i struggled to zip it up. an
0,I tried this on in the store - i tried regular medium which was way too big except in the chest where it was really tight. the material was a little itchy on me (but maybe its because the chest was tight). the color is lovely (pink). im sure someone will love it but if you are petite  i would order the petite and maybe size up if you are busty.
0,I ordered this in the pink color. the fit was fine  but i didn't care for how thin it was. there is lining  which i suppose is there to combat the thinness  but it's only in certain places. the lining should have been all over. maybe if i had gotten this in blue  it wouldn't have been so bad.
1,I gave this in her brighter rose colored print and love it! i get many compliments on this top! i did size up from my usual small to a medium to accommodate the girls :)
0,"Like the other reviewers  i agree that this sweater is waaaay shorter than it looks on the model. i think she's wearing a large size and it's probably cinched in the back. still cute  though! i'm 5'9"" 145 and a medium fits well -- looks cute with high-waisted jeans (which i wear anyway)."
1,Love a gray sweater and this one is stunning. layered with a plaid tunic and worn to work  with many compliments. the only downside is the poncho shape  with the large wing like sleeves  makes it impossible to wear a coat over this sweater. if you wanted to wear in the winter cold  you would need a cape. also not an ideal piece if you need to lift your arms for any reason. keeping that in mind though  i still really like it for days when i want to look cute and won't be don't a ton of moving aro
-1,I have blazers in size 8 from this designer and they fit with room to spare. i understand this is a more fitted style  but it is still way too small. size 10 and size 12 were not much bigger. great colors and cute design  but just too small even if you do not plan on buttoning it. i hope they bring back this jacket but make it true to size.
-1,"In paper crown dresses  i wear a small or size 6  so for this top  i ordered a small. it was huge on me! for reference  i'm 5'7""  130 lbs  34a. it is very wide towards the bottom  and it flares out way more than in the picture. the material is also a little stiff  so it really sticks out. even if i sized down to the xs  i think the bottom would still look unflattering  so i'm returning this."
0,Great quality top. i do wish it fit me...i'm really long waisted and this top was too short. had to return
1,"Not sure why this says ""online exclusive"" as i bought it in green in the store. i also saw it in a mustard color at another location. but in any case  this is an adorable and flattering dress. fabric is kind of a chino. weighty but not too heavy. great color and design. runs a bit small. my normal size was snug and i thought that in the summer heat i would not want it that clingy so went up a size. i love it and would buy it in more colors!"
0,Color is beautiful but looks like a maternity top on. i found i could tuck it in slacks and it looked fine. now for the cons:  it is supposed to be peacock design but i had only one peacock under my arm  which could be seen  i guess  if i waved. the rest were parts of the bird. i would love to have the one in the photos!  next  who thought cheap white buttons on the back was a good idea?  if i had gotten a nice patterned top  i would have replaced the buttons. blouses that i like never seem to b
-1,These would have been the perfect black pants! great cut  love the wide band in the front  true to size  quality construction. but a zipper in the back?!!! i had to ask my husband to help me zip them up. perhaps they would be easier to put on if my bum were a little smaller  but the pants fit perfectly - they were just too hard to put on. sending them back  since i don't have an assistant to zip them up whenever i need.
1,Buy it. buy it right now! this dress is gorgeous  and would be on anyone. i don't care what size you are  it's so pretty  that you feel pretty in it! i loved wearing it  and since i am in florida  i can wear it all year long. so it's worth it. happy  very happy  with this purchase!
1,I liked this dress but wasn't sure about the color on me. i tried it on anyway. originally  i tried on the 0  but it seemed big so i ordered the 00. also usually i order petite  but this dress is already short (and i am not getting younger)  so i went with regular size this time. color was not bad on my pale skin  i think the hue was ok (surprisingly). one thing that might bug the perfectionist in me  the zig zag isn't always aligned  the waist  for instance was crooked  but if it is like that e
-1,I really loved this dress in the store when i tried it on the color and fabric were perfect for summer but once i got this home i noticed the placket wouldn't lay flat across the bust like shown in pictures. when i went up a size it was too large under the arms so this one will sadly have to go back to the store.
-1,Poor quality. i expected much more from the material.
1,This dress looks better when wearing  i am 5.8 regular size s or 6. cup 34 d and fits perfect. length and width. in the front is shorter while the back has that pretty extra length. the video that is showing here is pretty much the full length.  but in case you need to adjust you can shorten easily. i wish the slip is the same length as the dress. i want this dress for a wedding anniversary by the beach so i will need to add some extra fabric. i hope it helps.
-1,Bummer  i fell in absolute love with these gems until i realized how weak the stretch is by the end of the day. i purchased them on the 13th of feb and can't bare to wear them anymore.
0,I ordered a six 6 petite. the pant leg was still very long. and if i have it tailored it will not preserve the whole point of these pants having a flare. this is a slim fit. i have heavy thighs and this was not for me. i'm 5' 120 lbs. also the tag warns that the fabric may leave color on lighter clothing. which i don't get  because it's spandex blend. also wasn't too hip in the zipper on the back.
1,This is a fun dress to have in your closet! i ordered the 4p  and it was just a little to short for my taste. had the regular 4 sent  and it was perfect! i wore it the very next night to a party... feels great and lots of fun with the bel sleeves!
-1,This dress was adorable & fit great! regrettably  i had to return it since it wasn't lined.
-1,Really wanted to love  the top was very flattering and loved the material: very swingy and forgiving. but way to much material  i was drowning in it. sized down to x small but no go.
1,"This is so pretty! it was beautiful in white but i bought the blue because the fabric is a little bit see through. i'm 5' 4"" and weigh about 135 and this shirt fit just like on the model in the picture. it was a nice neat loose. not sloppy at all."
0,It's hard enough for women to find clothing that will make them look as beautiful as they feel but add a bigger bust size (i'm a 36dd) and it makes it this much harder. i ordered this top because of how beautiful it looked on the model and the price. when it arrived i was so excited! retailer does such a beautiful job with the way they handle their items! it was wrapped beautiful and no damage. i ordered a size 8 knowing that my chest could be a potential problem. the too itself is gorgeous! i did
0,"The fabric is wonderful  flows nicely and soft. i am 5'7""  145lbs and usually wear between a s and m. i ordered a s in this due to the majority of reviews and found it to fit my shoulders well and length was fine. after reading the reviews i was so excited to get it but for me it actually made me look larger. there was too much material for me on the bottom and it actually made me look like i had a ""pooch""  never a good thing. i thought of returning for a m as i thought maybe it would have hung"
0,I loved the design of these pants  and got them to go with the matching jacket. the problem with them is there isn't enough stretch to keep them up. i found that thru out the day i was pulling them up  as they would slide down. the pant fabric should have had more stretch or they should have put stronger elastic at the waist.
-1,"Runs extremely large. i got an xs and am 5'4"" 115lbs and this would have fit someone who typically wears a size 10-14 and is 5'6"" and above. very disappointed with the size. the quality of the fabric wasn't great either. i wanted it to work so bad but just didn't!"
1,"I love the color  which is eye popping without being gaudy. i am 142lbs  5' 4"" and got size 4. it goes beautifully on my slightly brown skin. the length is just above the knee and the fold of the dress in the front adds that extra touch of oomph. it does have wide arm holes so a bra  even a strapless one  could be tricky  although it wasn't a gaping hole for me. i think i could wear it over a green bikini-like halter bra and take care of the arm issue."
0,I love this blouse on the model online. however  i couldn't get it to lay right and the material was a little scratchy for me. did not like the glittery thread.
-1,I tried this shirt at my local retailer and absolutely loved it ...until i read dry clean only!!!  really retailer? i know you can do better than that...
1,This dress is really lovely in person. the fit was perfect and the length not too short. for reference  i'm very busty at 38f and the dress actually fit! (i'm an xl usually  and the fit was tts) the only thing i'm not crazy about is the slip  it's more of a flesh toned color. i'll probably swap it out for a white one please make more like these  retailer!
-1,And not in a good way. everywhere i went  i left a little of this sweater behind. within hours of having it on  i was picking balls of fabric off the couch  bed  and the sweater itself looked like it was molting. great style  fabric and fit (although a little on the long side ) but there's no way i can keep it.
-1,I generally don't write bad reviews  but there is a real discrepancy between the quality of this kimono and the cost. the design and colors are great  but the fabric is ripping on all the kimonos on the rack in my store where the manufacturer's tag is at the back of the neck. the material is very thin  so there are other small holes beginning throughout the garment. i shop at retailer all the time  and this is not a $98 item of clothing.
-1,Looks great  the material feels great but when i put this dress on for the first time today it fell apart at the seams in the rib cage area. total disappointment! i had purchased this on sale for my graduation and was getting ready to walk out the door when i saw two holes on each side!
-1,I actually had no problem with the neck hole of this shirt  even with the xs size. however  i had a huge issue with the bottom eyelet section. it's so tight! it stretches across my thighs and looks so funny  as the top part is still loose. i tried moving up to a size small and still had this problem. maybe just not for girls with thighs ... very strange fit.
1,I wear between a l and xl..i chose the xl which was the right choice..if you are a bit curvy in proportions  i could size up. the color is gorgeous...i just logged back on to order another if there were options  but alas  there are not. flattering arm cut! could be worn for work  or with jeans/ out to dinner. it's cute  you won't regret it! (as a side note  it is sheer...which you can see in the photo. needs a cami)
0,I wanted to love this dress. i bought the cranberry color and it really is gorgeous. the cut was wrong for my body type. it is a bit roomier than expected. but i wear a size 36ddd so the seams on the chest hit at a very awkward spot. i'm sure it would look great on someone with a smaller chest
0,Cute dress...but akward fit. sleeves are a bit sung but the rest of the dress is a little large for its size.
0,This is really cute but does run large  if your in between sizes size down. the fabric at the front is super bulky but with a smaller size could be ok? it is so itchy  imo uncomfotably so! i would have returned for a smaller size had it not been so uncomfortable  ugh why! i loved the sleeves  very cute bell. and the back hung nicely. they need to make this in a cotton  vocoder and no wool! loved bit couldnt bear it.
1,This shirt feels so nice  it's heavier weight and so soft.. i think it's lyocel... such a great drape to the shirt that is so flattering. i am 5'8'' 128lbs and 34c/d and purchased a size 4. found this item to be true to size  if not slightly loose  but i love the flow of it. highly recommend  the green is classic and timeless  very versatile.
1,Don't detach the collar unless you like getting frustrated. i made the mistake of taking it off just to see what it looks like without it (cute) but reattaching was the biggest pain! i have pretty nimble fingers but stretching the little loops around the little buttons tested my patience to the limit. so other than that--buy this sweater if you get a chance. it's stylish  flattering  soft  versatile  etc  etc...
1,I love this jacket so much  i bought two. it goes with almost everything and is a nice weight for almost any weather. i recommend you grab it while it's on sale.
1,I bought this top to match a maxi skirt and it was pretty close to perfect.  i got the blue color   which is more of a brighter blue than a navy.  i'm 6ft and wear a 10 top  but got this in a large hoping to gain some length in the torso out of the of a large and could have gone a size down.  the top was definitely long enough and i didn't have the problems with the gaping at the hook that other reviewers had. this is probably because i went a little larger in the sizing and i have a very small
0,I want to like and keep. at this price point i cant justify keeping. if it does go to clearance i will reorder. due to the thin material it seems more summery and casual than what i was anticipating. true to size. i ordered a medium and am 5'9 and 155 pounds.
0,The print is unique and fun. however  the longer length and heavier weight of the fabric was not the piece i needed in my closet.
1,I adore this top! the tencel fabric feels like a nicely worn out denim shirt that's been worn for years. it is a versatile piece that can be worn year round.  even if the sleeves are pulled onto the shoulders   it still works and looks just fine. i'm broad in the shoulders  and we'll endowed   but the large was perfect.
1,Cute sweater! the side panels are perforated so you may want to wear either a nude bra or a cami underneath..
1,I love this sweater  it's so soft  and it seems to mold to my body more every time i wear it. it runs true to size  but i have noticed that as i wear it more and more  it seems to stretch a little. overall  i am very happy with it and would definitely recommend it!
0,Although the design and quality were great  this did not work for me. it was boxy  square and overwhelmed my petite frame. if you are taller  or have a longer torso  this may be a great basic staple for your wardrobe.
-1,I tried this dress on in a 6 and a 4 (a 4 is a little small for me but it looked so loose and flowy i thought sizing down would be a good idea). the 4 fit in the outer layer  however as the previous poster mentioned  the lining is super tight. i couldn't even pull the 4 lining down over my hips. the 6 was far too big in the shoulders and arms and still too tight in the lining. not sure what when wrong here but it's a shame because it's a really cute dress.
-1,I wanted to love this sweater. the color is gorgeous  the pattern unusual  it is soft and warm  and would have gone with so many things. but the cut is awful. mainly the sleeves are way too big  making me look misshapen and my arms look huge. the body was a bit boxy but that would have been workable if the arms had been normal. too bad.

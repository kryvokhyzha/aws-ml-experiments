1,I only say that this sleep top runs small because it shrinks a whole size after you wash it. i'd recommend that you order up a size for that reason. otherwise it is cute. i am ordering the shorts to go with it.
1,This dress set my heart a-flutter  but i had quite a time figuring out the sizing. i literally ordered six different sizes  and when i put them on  they all seemed to look like a very beautifully embroidered and elegant tent. if only i could just nip it in a tiny bit at the waist! then it would look like the model does! (i actually think they probably pinned the back of the dress to get it to fit on the model).  so i played around with it and ended up putting in 2 small darts in the front. and v
1,I do love this shirt  but when it arrived  it had makeup around the collar  apparently from someone else who had tried it on. i was able to clean it up with just soap and water so no big problem  but it did make for a poor first impression!
-1,I wanted to love this  but instead of being a flowy kimono top as pictured- it was a thick blazer type garment. not at all what is pictured here unfortunately. also it was much shorter than pictured and i am only 5'4''.     love most retailer styles  but this one was a miss and a return.
-1,It is a beautiful sweater  but it is cropped and boxy.
1,I bought this tee becasue of the color and brand (my favorite tees last summer were by bordeaux) and am so pleased. the color is great for a fall layering piece  and the fabric is so soft....amazing! it may be better for layering  the fabric is very thin.
0,"So this is a gorgeous dress  but it seems to have too many elements. i wish they had left off the white lacy decoration at the neckline because it seems to make the dress more ""girly"" than ""sleek."" i am short  so perhaps the multiple design features would be better on a tall woman than on me."
0,"I am 5'-7"" and 135 lbs  i bought a medium petite as i wanted the dress to hit at my knees  instead of midi. this dress is easily 2 sizes bigger than expected. the pattern was not flattering on my although i'm sure it would be for others. i was happy with the length..."
1,"This poncho is lovely. i found it fits perfectly. im 5'4""  125 and got the xs/s..just long enough (loke jacket length) and the hood doesnt add extra weight (doesnt drag it down the back). arm holes are approriate size. very cool piece for any weather layering."
-1,I really wanted to like this jump suit.  i rarely have problem with retailer clothing.  i'm 5.6  hourglass shape  usually wear size 2.  this jumpsuit runs small  but that's not the only problem.  top part (shirt piece of the jumpsuit) is too short  so it's digging into my lady part.  the color does not look anything like the picture  so overall this piece is failure.  i hope that i find something similar but fits better.
0,While this is gorgeous in person  if you have a larger bust the v-neck will look really weird. because its so deep  it gets skewed(i'm a d cup). if only the v were 1 or 2 inches higher! unfortunately it's going back.
1,This is a very stylish cardigan but it runs small. i usually take a small but i took a medium in this. for reference i am 130 lbs  chest 36c. i fell so in love with it once i put it on but you have to watch for snags as it is extremely delicate. got the 20% off today and couldn't be happier with this purchase.
-1,This dress was really odd. i loved the quirky mixture of the blue stripe and the floral but that's about it. the shape was unflattering but honestly that could be because this dress ran large. i was just very underwhelmed with this dress. also the hidden button zipper at the front was an amazing idea but not the best execution. overall its okay just hated it on me.
-1,The fit on this shirt is bizarre--it very much resembles a nursing top (but wouldn't actually work for that purpose). the side visible in the picture is nicely draped  but the other side can flap open and is completely different. i tried two different sizes and both were equally unfortunate!
0,I found this dress to run very large. the fabric was substantial but rather coarse. also  the lighter color in the pattern is lavender and not white or cream.
1,I really like how this fits. it is soft and the eyelet details are very cute.
1,"I am 5'4""  170lbs  34dd and a medium fits beautifully in this top. the mint green is very pretty  and a nude bra under it works without showing and without it being see-thru. it is super soft and pretty  and doesn't cling. i love it!"
0,I was excited to receive this tunic in the red (more of a rose color) yet so disappointed to find out how large it runs. my usual size with retailer is a small (sometimes  xs). after reading through the reviews  i ordered an xs and even the xs is too big -- just too much fabric. unfortunately  the xxs is sold out and the xs will be returned.
1,Very comfortable  well made  great with leggings or skinny jeans.
-1,The good: the sloths are cute because sloths are always cute.     now the bad: the material is wretched. it feels damp even when it's not... it's see through and unlined... it's scratchy and wrinkly... and though the cut of the dress would be fine  the fabric is so limp that the high-low hem looks more like a tail.     i wanted to like this  but charging nearly 200 dollars for a see through piece of awful fabric with a passable cut was simple not acceptable. i returned it as fast as i possibly c
0,A beautiful blouse;however  i assumed from the photo that it had a lining. it does not and the blouse is very sheer. it seems to run a bit small also  and if i add a camisole it might be too tight. the length is adequate. i may be returning it although it is very lovely and feminine.
1,This top is great and perfect for fall/winter. i've gotten a lot of wear out of this so far...great with jeans and sneakers for a casual look  or dress it up with black jeans and boots. great layering piece as well. the fabric is soft and comfortable. the fit is nice and relaxed  but tailored on the sides to give you some shape. the colors are beautiful.great buy  i highly recommend!
0,This top is beautiful but beware there is a lot of extra material on the sides. it was not flattering on only because of all the excess fabric. clearly the model in the picture has it pinned behind her. it would be a keeper if it was cut closer to the body but sadly it's going back.
1,A really great basic that can be styled a number of ways. i bought it in tan and white and received many compliments on it. the slightly off the shoulder look is really flattering and perfect for a spring or summer look.
1,This sweater is one of a kind just like many pieces from retailer. the design is super cute the color is perfect and others dont like the sheer material however for me since it's not see through i really like it. the reason for a return is they sent me the wrong size..ordered a small (i checked my order) and i got a xs petite. so sad since large is the only size left.
-1,I'm returning this cardigan. it doesn't fit me at all. it's shapeless and loose.
0,"For reference  i'm 113 lbs  with a short torso so i was thrilled when i saw this jacket on-line. i was expecting a soft  comfortable and polished piece. i tried on a standard size xs and the color of the khaki is muted on line  it's a little darker in person and the finishings like zipper plackets are much lighter in contrast. also  it is a ""mixed-media/material"" type. for example  it's linen with soft leather accents  which also have varying tones on the inside of the collar  on the wrist area "
1,I really feel in love with the details of these joggers and they did not fail me when they arrived. i haven't worn them yet but tried them on and they seem like nice little relaxed wear with a tee shirt. i can see them being worn with a cami in warm weather or a relaxed tee shirt in a variety of colors. all in all   very versatile   and i recommend them.
-1,If you are going for a ridiculously high priced ugly sweater contest  this is the one for you. i normally like clothing with some character and juxtaposition  but this one did not do it for me. i cannot imagine the collar fitting right or flattering anyone  and the mixed layers end up making it look cheap rather than trendy.
1,This is the perfect sweater dress for any occasion. i dressed it up with a belt and necklace for a christmas party and wore it with boots to just kick around the house. it's a really warm dress too  so great for colder weather. probably would not want to wear this dress in warm temps.  it's so comfortable and it's made with high quality material. i'm curvy on the bottom and my only wish is that this dress had less material around my waist- it's a pretty straight cut.
-1,This picture does not represent these jeans .. the color is way off. they are more yellow toned and look much more worn than in the picture. they also run very small.
0,I loved this top when i saw it online  and i still love the idea of it. unfortunately  the execution of the design fell short. i'm 5'4 w/ a long lean torso. i ordered my usual small  and the arms on the shirt were so long! b/c of the way the sides of the top cut up and my 34 d chest  i don't think a petite would work for me. such a cute top  but it just won't work for me.
1,I bought this in black last year and i love it. i also like the two prints offered here but unfortunately the matching tops aren't really my style and these prints wouldn't be so easy to mix and match. please offer in other solid colors! i would buy all of them  this skirt is really that fabulous.     not only does it fit well and run true to size  it also comes up a bit further than other swim skirts i have tried on  and gives a little more tummy coverage. but not too much! somehow it hits me a
-1,This dress has beautiful lines. i loved the design on the material  but the fabric looked very cheap & even was already snagged when it arrived. unfortunately  i must return it.
0,I ordered two of these  the grey and ivory. i have had great luck with jackets and blazers from retailer. these were the exception. i just could not pull them off. the quality was great but they had little shape except being a bit boxy. i do have wider hips. maybe these would look better on someone tall and thin? for reference  i am 5'6 and about 138lbs. i ordered smalls and the sizing was perfect for me  the style was just off. i had to return both.
0,Purchased these pants that i had quickly tried on. when i got home  i re-tried them and felt they were too snug and the material had an odd feel and did not lay right. i took them back and tried them in the next size. they fit much better but the material did not lay well on me. i think that they are a bit too stretchy and ended up not buying the larger ones either. i would definitely recommend trying these in a store rather then ordering online.
-1,No. this is one of the most unflattering things i've ever put on my body. i'm a very well-proportioned hourglass - i tend to wear a small despite a booty and 36d chest - this made me look huge. don't do it.
-1,Dress was a disappoint. very thin and cheaply made  not worth the money at all. pictures make it look much better than in real life. top area is also made small so if you are busty  this is not the dress for you.
1,I love this tee! i bought the teal in store. rich colors. little details are perfect. the loose got was very flattering on me. i'm not busty at all and it hung so well. wore it to brunch and the flight home later!
1,Great pants. i'm 5'6 and about 130. the size 2 fit nice at the waist and loose in the thigh. they hit right at the ankle. the colors are nice/ muted. the details are great. overall great pants.
-1,First off  this runs very large. i'm normally an 8 and sized down to the 6 but probably could have done a 4. it looked like a tent on me. the top part is lovely  i just think the bottom is way to large and not flattering. this one is definitely going back especially with all the white dress options they have out now.
0,The jacket was nice and soft but it was too short on my torso with a cropped fit which i'm not a fan of that style. i returned it.
1,"I have so many compliments on this blouse. i love the style and design. i wear it with my long cotton skirt because it runs a little short since i have a long torso and i am 5""8 tall. i would love to wear it with my skinny pants but then it won't look right in the back kinda hang out. otherwise really nice quality blouse. i would definitely buy another just to have a back up."
0,Saw online and had to have. got it home and i was swimming in it! i normally am a size l in most retailer brands  but this felt so large! the actual top is lovely  with an airy artistic quality to it. not sure if i will go back for the medium or not.
-1,The print doesn't necessarily works for everybody.
0,It is a very pretty skirt but arrived extremely wrinkled and the waist is very fitted. overall i probably would not have purchased it if i had actually seen it in the store.
0,I purchased this shirt online. i thought it would be perfect for work  but when i tried it on  i couldn't even button half the buttons. it is also extremely see-through  and even a nude or white cami underneath would look really odd. need to return  unfortunately. if the top came in other colors  i would return for a larger size  but i can't deal with see-through work tops.
-1,I loved this dress online and was luckily able to locate it in a store about an hour away from me. i drove to the store to purchase it; however  when i tried it on  i was so disappointed! the print is adorable and it is made of great quality  but the swing style is definitely more than mini! i could have fit 3 of myself in this dress. it is definitely not as depicted in the photographs. also  the background of the dress is way more pink than appears in the photos  and the floral print isn't as r
1,I love the look of this shirt. it is super soft and has a great draping quality. i personally love that the mid-stomach seem is see through  but if you didn't like that  you could easily wear a tank under it. overall good buy!
-1,Agree with above review. these are described totally wrong. they are not 8.5 rise. they are very high rise  so much that i didnt even try them on...the color isnt good either  it looks like a cheap levi's color or just not a quality denim. if you like high rise  you might like them. i can't comment on fit..
0,The design looked super cute online  but in person  the material seemed cheap. actually  at least in the green one  the material is different in the striped and solid sections; if it had all been the striped material  it would have been much nicer.
0,"First  i love wool. if it's 100% wool  i love it. if wool isn't your thing  then this dress isn't for you. i ordered this dress online in the burgundy. it is not itchy. it falls above my knees and i am 5'3"". it is warm and cozy with pockets  which i love. with the sleeves being short  i am wearing a long  frilly cardigan over it. i ordered the small (did not notice a size chart with this product). i am usually a size 4 or 6. it fits great in the bodice  but runs large through the hips. however "
-1,This is an extremely flattering dress. i couldn't resist buying it  even though i didn't come into the store looking for a dressier dress  which i feel this is. once i tried it on  i had to purchase it. its one of those things that i know i won't regret because at some point  an occasion will show up that i'll wear it to. its soft  comfy and flowing and accentuates the body's curves without being too tight or clingy. its a classic!
1,The pattern is cute and vibrant  and the shillouette is simple  but the courderoy felt too heavy and stiff and it was too small around the chest for me (36dd).
0,I was really excited to get this top but unfortunately its going to have to go back. i am 5'6 120 and usually a s fits. however  this was really tight. also  the material is really really thin for the $90 price-tag. save yourself some money and avoid this one.
1,Runs large under arms i am typically a size medium but bought size small.
0,Ordered it because i am fan of floral dresses. i found that colors are not as bright as pictured  overall color looks beige in real life. fabric has nice weight  not too heavy nor too light  it is not itchy  but not very soft either. good dress for colder weather. the sizing was right  i got my usual m and i am 5'10'' 145lb. the dress has a side zipper  but i did not need it. the dress is slimming and close to the body. the cut did not work for me: sleeves were too short  i had to pull them up t
0,Way to v necked- other than that would be a nice go to top. needs a cami.
-1,Like some other reviewers  i  too  have to comment on the dress's fit. the dress doesn't fit right around the bust or the waist. as a seamstress myself  i know that the problem is that it doesn't have any darts in the bust  and thus the bust and the waist are just about the same size. this dress really just needed a few of these extra hidden details to fit right. while a belt helps  i don't think it helps enough to justify the price. it's too bad--i think the concept of it is cool  and i was rea
1,I agree with the other reviews! perfect color and weight to the dress. should wear well in summer and fall. i'm 5'5'' 34c 140lbs athletic and got the 6 regular. fit well and the length was perfect with flats.
-1,This dress either runs large or just has too much fabric. ordered my usual size  but it is too long and too baggy to do a thing for me. embroidery pretty  but background is more of a muddy gray  then denim as shown. if the smaller size in petite was available  i'd have exchanged it  but it is going back.
-1,Another tent-like tee. this shirt is thin but not in a bad way and the color and design are really nice. but...it is really boxy and i'm just tired of that look. the longer sleeves are a plus for fall.
0,I love this shirt. tried in on in stores. i'm typically a medium across the board. i'm 5'6  137lbs  34d. i went for the size 6 figuring the 4 would be too small. the 6 fit... but it's short like everyone else said. not crop top short but definitely raise your arms and stomach is exposed short. i didn't buy it for the $50 price tag because of the shortness. but now that it's 30% i might spring for it  regardless of the weird cut. it's super cute otherwise!
-1,This is a nice shirt  but i can't keep it. i ordered a 0 and i do have an athletic build with somewhat wider shoulders given how petite i am (usually wear 00 petite in all pants) and i think this size was perfect (fit across the back perfectly) when you lift your arms the way it is cut makes it really tight across the chest and shows your stomach. at the same time  the high low styling makes for a really strange shirt-tail in the back. i'm sure this is the trend but it really does not look cute
-1,So disappointed! beautiful dress in the photographs but the cut was incredibly strange. loose and baggy through the top and mid-section but tight around the buttock and thighs.
0,I am so sad that this romper didn't work out. it's just way too billowy and huge. i am usually between a small and medium so i ordered this small. i'm petite and somewhat curvy and i was absolutely swimming in this romper! might look best on taller girls. i am 5 '2 and about 125-130 lbs and this was like wearing a tent. do not recommend. such a bummer because i was a believer after treading all of the great reviews!
0,Pretty top  i like the flutter sleeve design.  the linen is thin- too sheer to not wear a cami underneath the white.  nice for the sale price.  can easily be dressed up or down.
-1,Great fabric and color but fits like a potato sack -- so sad bc i would have loved it
-1,I love the idea of this top  but wish there wasn't so much fabric. i am wearing a medium in the photos and for reference my measurements are 38-30-40.
0,These pants are so cute and comfortable that i ordered each color.  after wearing the black ones one day  they stretched out so badly that i returned the other two colors.  i wish the fabric was thicker with more stretch because the style and cut is really cute. bummer
1,First off  the moment i put on  i got tons of compliments from complete strangers. it truly is a unique and pretty. i am 5'3 and originally wanted the med petite for length. they were sold out so i got the xs in the regular size. that worked out good. it is a bit snug around the shoulders but not enough to go up a size. overall  xs was a good alternative to medium petite.

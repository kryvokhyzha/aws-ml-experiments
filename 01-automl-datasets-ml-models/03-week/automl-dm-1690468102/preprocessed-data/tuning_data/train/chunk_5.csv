0,I didn't have as much of a problem with the sheer fabric as the other reviewers  but this dress is incredibly long and large  especially compared to the picture. for reference  i'm usually a 4/6 in retailer dresses and the small was huge on me  particularly on the bottom half. i was very disappointed because this dress looks so cute online!
1,Beautiful shirt. the color is more navy than pictured. the middle of the moon is stitched embroiderer - very original and a fun texture. my only qualms with this shirt is the trapezoid cut - it flairs out slightly but enough to notice from shoulders to the bottom hem.
0,"This is a beautiful dress with unfortunate design flaws at the bodice of the dress. the fit at hips and length is perfect  falling just to my knee (i'm 5'5"" 142 lbs.) and grazing my hips. in that regard the fit is spectacular. but the bodice seems cut very oddly  which would require tayloring to correct. the armholes are large and flared at the bottom which leaves 'wings' just under the arms that stick out. since this dress has a side zip  to correct that would seem a major undertaking. the stra"
0,I loved the look of this shirt but full price was a little steep so i waited for it to go on sale and am glad i waited because only a l was left and it was perfect fit since i originally was thinkng of getting a small or medium which i usually do at retailer but this one was running really small compared to retailer other shirts. the fabric is great but when i looked at it carefully  the zipper construction is sewn poorly as well as the sewing at the buttons area...also  there were a lot of thread h
-1,Loved the look of the sweater and the the fit was as shown.  however this is a thin cashmere for the price.  returned.
0,If you like looking like a giant square and hide things this is the way to go. for me  it completely irradiates my shape  including my neck. this will be returned.
1,These tanks are perfect for working out! they have big armholes so could work with a bralette but probably not a normal bra. the material is soft but they do shrink in th wash
0,I ordered a large and it was skin tight  if that's the look you're going for..
-1,This sweater was pretty short. beyond that  when i raised my arms  the thickness of the sweater caused the shoulders to rise up and stay there when i put my arms down.
-1,Was super excited to try this on  but had to go up 3 sizes from my normal 6 and the waist was still too tight - i was swimming in the top as well. just a very strange cut and unflattering. such a bummer because it's so pretty.
0,This is super cute and the colors are so vibrant and its thin enough to wear with tanks for the summer but it already had a hole forming in the upper back shoulder.  i guess the material was a little too thin....$98 is a little too much money for something that gets holes so easily!
-1,This top is exactly what i was hoping for except it is missing the drawstring. so disappointing  mailing it back.
1,The most important thing is that my husband said he really liked the dress when i put it on.
1,Very cute shorts. sadly  after one wash they became a lint magnet so had to be returned. disappointing quality.
-1,This top was way too short (i'm only 5'1) and way too wide. the cut of this top was so wide  it looked like a tent on me. i really wanted to love this top because the material and style (sleeves  ruffle) are beautiful  unfortunately there is something wrong with the cut. i've have several blouses made by one fine day  which fit nicely  for some reason this top did not. i ordered in my usual s size  even going to an xs would not work because the cut is wrong.
0,But i didn't like the fit. maybe because i ordered petite and the length threw me off  but they weren't flattering in any way. the color and material were unique and pleasing. had to send them back though.
0,"I agree with the other reviewer who stated this sweater is very ""80's""!! online it looks minorly fluffy with muted colors  but in person it's a bad overly-fuzzy christmas sweater with super bright 80's colors!! if you're going for kitschy / tacky / retro this may work for you  but if you are looking for the sweater in the photo you'll be disappointed... :( it looked to be true to size  but to be honest i hated it so much i didn't even try it on."
-1,This is the tiniest blazer i've ever purchased in a size 10. i usually wear an 8  but sized up based on other reviews and it was still too small. it's very attractive but please size true to size
1,I tried these on in the store and didn't buy them with the other items in my 'yes' pile. i couldn't stop thinking about them and ended up ordering them. they are so cute. the fabric is a nice weight. they have little stretch.
-1,Bought the dress online and it only has an eye and hook at the top. the waist has no stretch and their isn't a zipper. you have to be a contortionist to get it over your head and shoulders. so cute in the pic but not realistic. going back.
-1,You have to be a contortionist to get this bra on. it slips over your head and i needed my 8yo daughter to help me pull it down past my elbows. ridiculously impractical. why oh why didn't heather give it a hook and loop closure instead?
0,"I am 5'8"" and 130 lbs and bought a size s. it fits  but is not as roomy as it appears in the model and the sleeves are not as long. the collar fits strangely on me. the deal breaker was that the sweater is not soft  but is itchy and kind of coarse. i am returning this one."
0,"I love this dress  but it is too short to keep. i am 5'8"" and weigh 124lbs. most of my cloths from retailer are either a size 4 or a small  but this dress is substantially shorter than other dresses purchased from retailer. it looks adorable on  but it is just too short (about 3 inches above my knees) to be considered professional enough to wear to work."
0,"I love ag jeans. i own several pair  and i think they wash well  and wear well. that being said  i'd never purchased a pair of the ""stevie"" cut before. they have the same quality one would expect from ag  and i like that the ankles aren't true skinny jeans  but have a little width. it's more on-trend for this season. for me  the issue was more with the color. i order pink. when they arrived  they were beautiful in the little plastic bag. my heart skipped a beat. hooray! cute new jeans! except  w"
1,So wanted to love this top. love the look entirely. but the medium was beyond snug  so i sent it back for a large. hopefully the bigger size will make it a keeper!
0,I really liked the style of this top but it's way oversized! i'm petite and drowned in this top even though i got it in an xs. the material is nice but i can't see i had a feeling for the cut because it runs so big. this one is going back to the store!
1,This dress stunning for the hourglass figure. the hips may be a little narrow. i bought the 6p and 4p and the 4p fit best. i read some reviews that said the hips were snug. it's true- a little difficult to sit down haha but the dress is so flattering. shoulders are a little loose  and i have pretty broad shoulders and a full chest. i'm 5'4  32dd  waist 27 and 130 lbs.
-1,Definitely agree with the other reviewers. this top looks great on the model  but pretty bad in real life. super boxy and has no give so everything just hangs. if you plan on ordering  i'd recommend sizing down.
-1,Matronly and unflattering. i think this may work on a very tall and slender body type.
0,"Lovely jeans  love the details in the cuff bottoms. the front of the jeans  the relaxed ""boyfriend"" part was just too relaxed for me - too much material there that it was unflattering. otherwise cute."
1,Love the material (more natural fiber than synthetic)  the pattern  and the colors. also  it is cozy! the one con is that it is really big and crazy-long. so long  that it may be a show-stopper. on the fence about that.
1,I got two of these when they went on sale because i hate paying $68 for a basic top like this.. but for the sale price they are great! comfortable  lightweight  and flattering. the black is a little sheer  but nothing a tank underneath can't solve. a good buy!
-1,So i recognized the fact that this dress was likely intended more for lounging than for wearing out and about  but i once had a lot of luck with dresses of this price point (and intent) at retailer  so i had hopes. i was just wanting it to be a great addition for vacations and beach days  but it's honestly so thin i couldn't even see it working that well for that. it's also cut smaller than i was anticipating judging by the way it fits the model; my usual small was way more bodycon than i was anti
1,This dress is a nice twist on a luncheon/work dress. can pair with blazer or sweater  and it looks really cute with hair styled up - almost throwback.    zipper sometimes gets a little caught on the lace top  but overall i'm really happy with this dress!
1,"I saw this piece and fell in love with it. the print is beautiful and is well placed on every piece! it is a little boxy  and is a bit warm for indoors  but it is unusual enough to overlook the flaws. i am 5'10"". usually a small  but sized up to a medium with this one."
-1,As other reviews have mentioned  this top has serious craftsman ship flaws. strings hanging off embellishments on sleeves and they begin unravelling as you try the top on. i wanted to love but sadly  returned asap.
-1,I loved the look of this dress online  so i was excited to order it  but when it arrived i found it was not at all how i expected it to be. i thought the material would be more lacy  but it seemed pretty cheap. there was also some boning at the waist which is nice in theory  but it made the material poof out just under the waist  making me look like i had a belly. no matter what i did i could not get it to lay flat. returned to the store and bought the embroidered perennial dress instead  which
1,I really likes these jeans. they are comfortable with stretch and look cute. the price is high but an investment for sure !
-1,I ordered this in size xl. the ivory was as pictured. the lace details were well-done. but  the length was much shorter than on the model. i'm 5 ft. 5 1/2 in. for reference. even the sleeves were on the short side  above my wrists. the main problem is how much it shed. just in trying it on  there was fuzz everywhere so i returned it. i love when retailer mixes lace into the knit of sweaters. this one just didn't work out.
0,I wanted to love this dress  but sadly i will be returning. the color looked fairly different in person than on the model. i thought it was a browner/neutral hue  but the dress is almost like a yellow seersucker-ish with brownish moth printing. was cuter than expected! the sweetheart neckline is darling  but that is where it fit me poorly. i have a 34c bust  and the cups of the size 4 were gaping on me in the front and all along the arm holes. the straps were also way too long and falling off my
1,It's a pretty dress  my only concern is the sleeve length. it's an awkward length and makes the dress look a little frumpy. i turned the sleeve up once and it looks so much better!. or  if you are a savvy sewer  you may want to tighten a little in the arms so the sleeve is a bit more fitted. overall quality and feel is very good. i usually fit into a 6  but for this dress i ordered both 6 and 8 and kept the 8. the chest is a bit snug and the button pops open if you don't order the correct size.
-1,They ripped on the inside upper thighs of both legs less than two months after purchase. i've washed them once  and wear them a few times a week  so they're certainly not worn out. i've never had a pair give out even close to this early. i loved the cut of the jeans and the softness  and they hold their shape well after multiple wearings. the color is lighter than pictured. i paid full price (the most i've ever paid for jeans) because i'd heard good things about jean shop quality. even at sale p
-1,I bought a petite medium and the length was right  but it fit like a potato sack. it was quite comfortable  and didn't look completely terrible from the front  but from the side  it was terribly unflattering. when i tried it on my boyfriend saw it and said it looked like i was wearing a nightie. i don't do form-fitting clothing  but this was the exact opposite and flared out every which way. it's got to go back.
1,Very nice top  fits true to size  a little short buy looks nice with jeans or work pants
0,I really wanted to love this everything about this piece. especially after reading all of the great review i was so excited and looking forward to getting this dress. unfortunately it just did not work out. i ordered a large and it fit fine but the dress did not give me the faltering shape i had read about and was hoping for. it literally just hung on me and made me look wider. sadly i had to return this.
0,First of all  the label on this dress is maeve  not nue by shani. second  i just wasn't impressed. the fabric is cool...it has a sort of embossed look to it and it's somewhat shiny  which sets it apart in a good way. but the cut is just boring. the top felt dowdy to me...overall  i was underwhelmed by this dress and returned it.
0,These are very cute leggings. i love the ribbed bottoms. as far as design and comfort  they are a five. but after only two wearings  they are pilling like crazy and look shabby. i'm very happy i only paid $23 for them. if i paid full price  i'd be more upset.
-1,I loved the fact that this dress is cotton. it is a thin cotton  and you can see in the photos that she is wearing a black slip with a thicker strap. mine came with a nude slip. i'm thinking they all come with a nude slip. i'm not sure why they showed the dress with the black thick strap slip unless it was to show the dress as a thicker cotton than what it actually is. the dress is adorable though which makes it hard for me to decide whether to keep it and hope mine won't tear easily or to retur
1,"Just picked this up in my retailer store and i love it. i bought the orange print and the colors are vibrant and perfect for summer. i am 5'5"" and  140 lbs. i took a small which is my usual size at retailer. could be worn unbuttoned as a sleeveless cardi over a tank. i will wear a cami underneath as it is sheer  but that doesn't bother me. another shopper was trying this on in the fitting room and it looked great on both of us. i will wear this all summer long. looks great with denim. happy find!"
0,I agree with the other reviews that these jeans run big. for my body  straight up and down  i ordered 2 sizes down  but would have ordered one size down had i been able to try them on in the store. the jeans i received were lighter  not blue  and more grey with very noticeable white whiskering. i need a new pair of jearns and i love the cut of these so i am keeping this pair  but  for me  because of the color they are just ok compared to the wow i was expecting from the picture.
-1,This top is very wide and shorter than in appears in the picture. it also has a strong chemical smell. i've had a couple pieces with that smell in the past and the smell never washed out.
1,In my opinion  the quality and uniqueness of this piece far definitely warrants a full price purchase. adorable cut and style  comfortable and cute. it's the perfect flexible top to wear to work with a skirt or more casually with your favorite pair of jeans. love this!
-1,It's such a pretty top but i felt that it looked maternity-ish so i returned it.
-1,I love the look of this dress but it runs very large. i am 5'2 110lbs. i ordered the extra small on sale & got a killer deal on it. i intended to use it as a beach cover up since it's sheer  but when i tried it on i felt like i was wearing a mumu. even for the price & for the beach i am going to return it. i'm sad because it is a beautiful cover-up and for what it is i think the quality is good.
-1,The material is cheap and looks torn. not as nice as the picture.
-1,So  ordered online. tried this on  boyfriend asked me if i was buying maternity clothes.   back it goes. super cute but huge.
0,The dress is beautiful  i wanted to like it and could hardly wait to reveive it. it fits beautifully  and snug except around the arms where it is huge. i could only wear it with a tshirt underneat.
0,These jeans fit well and the stretch makes them comfortable. i can't recommemd them though because they're see through. wish white jeans were better lined so that this isn't usually a problem!
0,Very nice fabric but disappointed in the stitching on the knees. it looks nice but makes the pants very uncomfortable and tight around the knees. too bad because i love the style and hoped they would work!
0,This skirt is not what i was expecting at all. for starters it runs large  i expected it to sit at the natural waist and it is definitely made to do so  but it was a good two inches too big and therefore wouldn't lay flat and gaped at the front. no bueno. my biggest gripe  though  is that the color looks nothing like it does in the picture. they have it paired with an ivory top and the two look like they match so well but do not be fooled  the background color of this skirt is not even close to
1,Fun   flirty  feminine!! love this blouse with jeans or with a skirt or leggings! i bought both blues i liked the first and after wearing it i ordered the navy with dots along with santuary black legging pants... just love !!!highly recommend. easy to wear.
1,"Love this top! i've worn it once and received several compliments. i'm 5'7""  127  and the small fit well. i'm happy with my purchase."
1,"I have an athletic body 5'6"". i have no curves and this dress made me look so feminine and long and lean. on top of it being beautiful   the dress has a very comfortable ""jersey knit type"" lining. so easy to wear and incredibly comfortable sitting and /or dancing."
1,"I'm trying to buy more basic  versatile clothes and this dress in gray is great for that. definitely runs large-- i usually wear an 8 and it fits in a 6p. i'm  5'5"" and the petite falls where it does on the model. the regular was unflatteringly long and sack-like. quality seems ok for the sale price."
1,This t fits perfect and looks great with just about anything. my only concern is the fabric is super light. not enough to be see through  but just enough to make me question the quality. i like it and i have worn it a couple of times now with no issues though. the drape is nice and not super revealing; discreet enough for work. i ordered the white and if it holds up i will certainly order another color because it is very versatile.
0,"I wanted to love this romper  but it just wasted right for me. i am 5'5""  135lbs  34c  curvy/muscular frame and ordered size small. i may have liked it better with more room in the medium  decided to return. i still recommend trying this product  but it wasn't for me and my hips!"
1,"This top is very pretty and you can definitely wear it without a cami with a nude bra if you're an outgoing person  especially for a summer evening. my only confusion is the too high neckline. if it was just a little lower  it would look and feel less ""chokey."" i keep wanting to pull it down. i'm a size 0 and needed the xxs which fits like most people's xs's as sizing continues to get bigger. really lovely except for the neckline. looks great over white or colored shorts and is a nice mix of cas"
1,I bought this jacket recently and i actually had been watching it in my retailer. store  but  they didn&#39;t have my size.  someone must have returned a size small and i scooped it up.  i probably would have bought the xs but  it was gone.  i went with it a little oversized and love it!  great quality and workmanship on the embroidery.   more like the items that retailer used to sell in 2004 and 2005!  super cute  love it!
1,I ordered the correct size due to reading other reviews who gave their height   weight  and chest size. thank you all for that! i am 5 feet 5 3/4 inches tall and fluctuate between 135 lbs and 139 lbs. i wear 36b in bras. i ordered an 8. fits great! the coverage is adequate on my backside. the rouching is very nice in the mid section for self conscious women like me. the color is fun and beautiful. the quality is excellent! i love the bra support! there are real bra cups sewn in! it was pricey bu
0,This is a beautiful and warm sweater  well cut and easy to dress up or down. the biggest problem is the extreme shedding which looks messy against darker clothing  especially against wool or cashmere winter coats.
-1,Had to return this for a couple of reasons: 1) was too small! it's made like one of those tiny mittens that stretches to fit any size hand. i didn't bother to order a size up because i wasn't sure whether to go from a small to a medium or to a large. 2) the main color isn't grey  like the picture. it's a black and white checkered pattern. so  it doesn't look at all grey irl.    i'm still recommending because  if you get the right size  and like the colors  it will be a nice  light and comfy swea
-1,I loved this dress. it fit perfectly everywhere except for the sleeves. the dress has an overall relaxed fit  but the sleeves were way too tight. i had to send back because of sleeves.

0,I really like this dress but after looking at the photo  it doesn't look like this  well at least on me. granted  i am 36dd so that might be part of the reason  but this dress is definitely trapeze style. i love the look but am cringing at the thought that someone is going to think i am pregnant. because of this  a belt is a must. plus it is the only way to achieve the look in the photos because it is a lot fuller in real life.     another nice touch to this dress is that versatility with the ru
-1,I really wanted to like this shirt the quality is amazing and much prettier in person but it is hard to take care of. if you wash it the wrinkles are horrible so it has to be dry clean only. also the back is ridiculously long it looks very odd from the side view.
-1,Runs very large. ordered a smaller size due to other reviews but should have ordered several sizes smaller
0,I wanted to love this shirt but it quickly lost shape and a hole was created in the middle of the shirt after just a few washes. not worth the price. poorly made. you need to wear a shirt underneath bc it is so thin. the shirt looks better int he picture. i like it but it wears terribly.
1,"I purchased this dress in blue and paired it with the seychelles forward platform wedges in cognac. the fit is amazing  the length is great (i'm 5'5"" and it hits me a couple inches above the knee)  and it is a great spring staple. my only issue with this dress is that is wrinkles so easily. easily fixed with a quick steam or low iron."
1,Love my jeans  fit great and very flattering. they are a tad snug in my usual size but i think with time they will stretch a bit. receive compliments every time i wear them. if they go on sale i will buy another. :)
1,Great skirt  can be dressy  work or casual  love it!
1,Love this skirt ! i thought it would be much shorter but when i tried it on it was the perfect length and super cute!! the material is thick but not uncomfortable and very move able!
-1,"First problem-i would not have ordered this at all had the description been correct. the fabric description is cotton which the dress is most certainly not. secondly  it has a really funky  cheap  unfinished  raw-hemmed slip which is simply not fitting for the dress. the keyhole in the front is super long-again  does not seem to fit the dress. i am not happy with this piece at all but it did fit tts. length is just above knee. i am 5'5"" 142 lbs 34d and the six was a good fit. sending this home t"
-1,I had high hopes for this dress  but unfortunately   was disappointed and returned the dress. it flares out with too much material under the gathered waist. it's so odd.
-1,I purchased this to wear on the same day. it did have a strong smell ! i tried airing but didn't help much so didn't wear. tags are cut so will probably give a try after washing (by hand  my fault for not checking this part). it is a bit over my price range for a casual top  so hoping i'll end up loving it!
0,This dress looks so beautiful on the model and i couldn't resist ordering it on-line. i have an athletic build -- read small hips -- straight. i'm 5'5' and 135 lbs. i was very disappointed when i put on. it's made for a curvy build. the dress was just too big  especially around the hips. i think this dress is probably beautiful on a curvier build!
-1,I really loved this top online and wanted to love it in person. it is soft and the patter is okay in person. the neckline is higher than i am used to. also  there are two buttons in the back that must be unbuttoned in order to wear the top. it is difficult to button them behind your neck with the top on. unfortunately i had to return this item...
-1,This blouse is a disappointment! it runs so large  it looks ridiculous. the cute is super wide and flared. they must have it pinned on the model. it is not flattering at all. i really thought this could be cute. not worth the money either! it's expensive and ill-fitting. for reference i am 5'3 and 123lbs and wear a 2 or 4.
0,I bought this jumpsuit in a size medium (32d  31 waist  38 hips/butt). i have a jumpsuit in this style but it's silk so i was looking for one i could wear anytime. that said  even i need a heel with this jumpsuit. the problems were these: first  it was very hard to get on. very hard to tie the back  get all four panels even  tied  hiding my bra  etc. lots of fussing. your may need a partner to help. if i hadn't been doing a lot of yoga  i may not have managed. once on  the style looked great. as
1,Cute  comfortable  easy to wear  even on my hourglass figure. can't decide the best shoes to wear with this - so it doesn't look frumpy.
0,I liked the look of the tunic sweater  and it was very soft. i am 5'7  115 lbs and tried on the xs. the arms felt a bit tight  but overall it fit well and i liked the length. i did not like how high the hem was split though- i would ideally like to wear these with a pair of leggings  and wish the hem was split just a little lower and not right at my hip. the material was very soft  but i felt like it was a bit cheap for the price.
1,I saw this at a store today and am so glad i tried it on. i'm usually xs in retailer tops  but for this shirt i preferred s for a loose fit. the lace detail is elegant and very pretty.
0,This is not worth $128. it looks cute on but....there is no support in the bust area. just a slight tuck in the fabric -it also is very flowy which is great and it is comfortable but for the price and the thinness and lack of meatiness to the fabric itself i cannot recommend and will be returning. i'll look for something else. i haven't bought from retailer in a dogs age and i hope the quality hasn't slipped - i will look for another option.
1,This dress is adorable! it fits loose and is not at all fitted  with the exception of the under cami lining. the picture showing front and back is being pulled to fit. :/ it fits like the model wearing the purple. my local store was out of my normal size so i sized up which really made no difference at all. the biggest difference would be the under cami. the dress is flowy and airy. one of the best casual dresses retailer has had in a long time. obviously  the blue is sold out till may. this can b
1,I ordered a size up after reading the reviews  but i wouldn't of had to. it's not a snug fit at all. although  i am fairly small busted. soft fabric with a little stretch that will be great for lounging around the house or running errands.
-1,This dress ran large--maybe because the pleats made this dress too roomy. the dress hung on my right shoulder but the dress did not hold up at all on the left side of my body  maybe because i have a short torso/petite frame. i loved the yellow color for summer--it would have made for a nice dress to wear for a wedding. unfortunately  i had to return it.
-1,I bought this dress to wear to an out of state wedding. first time wearing  when i tied the strap  the pull through at the top of the halter broke with minimal stress. i sewed it back with a repair kit from the hotel but was worried the whole night the dress would not hold up. if this is all that is holding the dress on  it should be more secure with reinforced stitching. beautiful material and comfortable.
-1,Only one sleeve is folded twice and sewed. meh.
-1,"I so loved this dress online. not so much in person. first of all it didn't fit my build. i'm 5'4"" with a 32f bust and the waist line was just a bit too high to be flattering. mainly i'm returning it because of the fabric. the petticoat netting does rustle as another buyer pointed out. my main fault is that the top fabric is synthetic and cheaply printed. basically it's the lining fabric of a better made dress or coat. if it were cotton voile or silk it would have been beautiful. why they made i"
-1,Unfortunately  this dress is shaped like a sack and has no shape to speak of. i have sent it back for a refund :( too big  too shapeless.
-1,These look much cuter in the picture than in person. i found them to be very thin and cheap looking. i am pretty sure you could find a similar pair at a budget department store.
-1,Love the look of this and the fabric  but runs way small. i usually wear a 0. ordered the 0  then 2. just got the 4 and it's still too small. will be returning all 3.
0,"I love the pattern (red motif) but the sizing of this dress is way off. the top fit fine but the hip area was so tight when standing with my legs hip-width apart. the only way it looked normal was if i stood with my feet together and thighs touching. i ordered my usual size 10 - for reference i am 5'9""  170# bra size 34f and 40-41"" hips."
1,"These jeans are extremely soft to the rich  as well as stretchy and flattering. they do not lose their shape after a whole day of wear. i am 5'3"" and the ankle length fits me as full length. i am a big fan."
1,"This dress is perfection it is extremely comfortable and versatile. great for dressing up or down. i am large busted (36g) so was delighted that it stretches as this is a problem for me finding clothing to fit allover. i am petite 5""1 with a curvy figure and a regular medium fit great!"
1,Love this sweater! it can be used for both work and casual wear with ease. very soft and seems durable. i highly recommend it!
0,This style is very pretty and flattering. i love the flow of the material and the open shoulders are nice for the design
-1,I bought this suit based on the great reviews. i was so bummed when i tried it on. the top fit so well but the bottom kept bunching up. my torso is on the longer side so maybe that's why the bottoms keep coming up. every time i pulled the shorts down  the top would come down too  and vice versa. i am 5'5 and 120lbs and bought a 2 which is my normal size. i did like that the top had a bit of padding but that's the extent of what i liked about it. i will be returning it.
0,"Love the shape and cut of this top but it is so sheer you could see my belly button through it. if it was a dark color i would buy it. wore my regular size small. i'm 5'5""130lbs  and 32dd."
1,I love these jeans! i wear them all the time. i love the way they fit and the price is great. please make these exact pants in more colors!
0,"I love the pattern of the red/orange dress. i bought this online for easter. i'm bummed. i felt frumpy. the dress fit. i'm 5'5"" athletic build and i bought the xs. it is just not flattering on my frame. i looked like i had big hips  the waist band was not creating a waist for me and i need that... i wanted to keep it but sadly i will be returning it. my husband agreed i should return it."
-1,Ii loved the idea of this summer top flowing in the breeze... then i got it and the selves did nit give as much slack as i would have hoped #spandex so #returned!
1,I'm 5'4 with an hourglass shape. i love this dress. it drapes nicely  the material won't be hot for summer and the color is perfect for my olive complexion.
0,Very pretty top. however you absolutely need to try it on before ordering. fit well in the chest area but way too big in the sides - i looked pregnant. had to return.
0,I'm undecided about this shirt. this design is absolutely beautiful. but the shirt is very very sheer and the front comes down so low in a curved hem line. so  when you wear the necessary base layer  the shirt extends several inches beyond that and it looks kind of odd. i really wish tiny would make some beautiful shirts like this that aren't sheer and have a shorter front. i purchased my regular size and it fits a little smaller than other tiny shirts i have purchased. since the shirt is so bea
1,I love the way the neckline is open not too low ! it also falls on your hips just right.    great buy
0,I really wanted this to work. the embroidery detail is very pretty. however  the inside of the sweatshirt is a bit scratchy from the embroidery so i would recommend wearing a cami or tank. the sweatshirt is also on the short size. the small hit the top of my jean waist. in the end  i decided to return it:(
0,This shirt is nice in theory but you need to have pretty long arms to make it work. you also need to be average to tall in height.
0,I was disappointed that this dress had no pockets  as every picture on this website suggests. otherwise  it is a great color and shape. still sad though...
0,This is absolutely huge.  it felt like it was at least 2 sizes too big - the empire waist wasn't even semi- fit.  36d chest and size small was like a tent.  however  the embroidery was beautiful
1,I loved this at first sight  and ordered it in a 10  12  and 14 to make sure i'd get one that fit me. (i ended up with the 12). i wear a 32 dd bra  so usually braless is not an option  but this actually offers enough support. and  if i do want to wear a bra it's got a well placed strap across the back that will cover it.     it's super flattering  and really fun to wear out day or night.
0,I wanted to love this because it's all my favorites: simple  chic design; pure silk; gorgeous color. in reality  the dress was 100% see-through  very thin  and poor quality silk. i posted pictures of me wearing this dress with a nude slip on underneath that i brought along for shopping elsewhere for business dresses. despite the thin quality of the silk  i was still considering spending this dress (despite it's unreasonably high $$$ for the quality)  but after trying it on i was really disappoin
1,This dress is very comfortable  not itchy at all and looks great. runs on the large side and is a tiny bit unflattering in the middle but it's still a worthwhile buy!
-1,The dress ran big but is tight at the bust  material is sooo sheer and the shape of the dress is off. you can't see the ruffle/ flounce that runs the bottom of the dress.
1,This shirt feels amazing  it is the perfect length for leggings. i have it in long sleeves also. i don't love the pink color i bought  it looks very different from the color pictured.
-1,This dress fits awfully. it's not short  as pictured in photo. it hit just above my knees. it looked like sack. i would've  also  felt like i was choking  all night with it clasped around my neck. it  potentially  may look okay on someone who is very tall  skinny  and lanky  but i have my doubts about that too.
-1,Here's an example of lowering a hemline and slapping the term 'petite' on it. too much fabric  was bulky  and ran too small. the fabric was thin and pulled awkwardly over the bust. returned..
0,Unfortunately  this is a lot more boxy in person than it shows on the model. it hung on me like a potato sack. also  the color isn't the rich red it shows but more of an orangey rust.
-1,The color is darker than shown (i ordered the denim looking one). the flower things are not very visible as it all looks one color. it must be great for the tall skinny model   but if your 5'4'' and pear shaped like me  it's a no go! took it back to my local store.
1,"I love the length of this top and i love tops that don't cling in the tummy area. it fits well and the crochet detailing is nice. for reference  i'm 5'.4.5""  150 lbs  34dd and the m fit me well. since i'll be wearing this with leggings mostly during colder months  this top is a little bright and the material is not meant for cold days. since i live in texas  i can get away wearing it even in colder months."
0,"Okay  i love the blouse this brand has in the same material  so i thought i'd delight in this dress. i am a 5'7"" hourglass but have a longer torso. i ordered the large in this  usually a 10 or 12 fits me.. but the waist hit much higher than my natural waist  and yet it was somewhat tight and completely rigid. the bust area was a little loose  and i'm a 36c. then the bottom flared out in sort of a flower fairy poof above my knees which reminded me of a navy blue oompa loompa dress.. and i love my"
1,Adorable! very pleased with the quality of the fabric and the very comfortable fit. i'm sure i'll wear this with jeans  as pictured  but can also see it with a breezy summer skirt.
1,Love this jacket.  it is quite stylish and comfortable at the same time.  i was surprised at how affordable it was.  my only complaint is that it could wash you out if you have pale skin and get the peach color.
1,I ordered this as a gift and may order myself one. it is so comfortable and pretty.
1,I love retailer sweaters! always great quality and design  this one is no exception. i have the navy blue one and it fits well  true to size.
1,I love this sweater! timeless--classical with an edge! i will have it until the end.
0,I want to love this dress. the colors and the fabric are absolutely beautiful. it is definitely a swing-dress. much wider than i expected...and i sized down. there is also a strange pooch in the shape around the middle. i am keeping it because i am in love with the the colors and print  and it looks very flattering when paired with a black denim jacket  just not alone.
1,This sweater is so beautiful on. it is thick material  but does not make you look boxy. it fits so nicely and is flattering. the design is just gorgeous. if you are considering this sweater-- get it  you won't regret it!  i'm normally a small (4-6) and i ordered a small. it fits true to size. the fit is *perfect* so if you want it slightly more relaxed  order one size up.
-1,It is a beautiful top but runs huge!!! i followed other reviews and ordered a size down hoping it would work but it was totally unflattering! i wanted so bad to love it but there was no way i could keep it!!
0,"I bought this online in my usual size (petite xxs) for in-store pickup. when i tried it on  the kindest word to describe it would be ""voluminous""--it was at least 2 sizes too big on me. i looked like i had taken grandma's tablecloth and constructed a homemade blouse. the blouse comes with an attached cami  which was also way too big for me. the color is not white (as described)  but rather an ivory/cream color--definitely not the best shade for my light olive skin. i do think that it looks lovel"
0,I love these pants but they run super big and still stretch after wearing. i am usually a 2/ 26 and had to get a 0. also the pocket flaps stick up on the corners and ironing doesnt help.  still comfortable but i would have never paid full price for these if i had known.
-1,This is a great cut and looks good on. it is a very poor quality material. it balled and frayed in two wears. i returned it to the store.
0,This dress pattern and material are great - it's just way too big. i even tried an xs and it looked like a huge sack on me. too bad  it had some real potential.
-1,I really wanted to love this dress. i love the colors and the design of the dress. unfortunately  i have to agree with one of the other reviewers that this dress makes you look pregnant. it's so voluminous that it's not flattering at all. also agree that the lining is scratchy.
-1,I originally bought this dress in the store. however  it ended being a size too big. so  i reordered the smaller size online (although it was backordered for a month). when it arrived  i noticed the sleeves were not cinched (like they are in the picture as well as the original dress i had purchased in-store). i thought maybe it had been a fluke so i returned the dress and reordered it again because it is a great dress. the second one just arrived and the sleeves are not cinched as well. this may

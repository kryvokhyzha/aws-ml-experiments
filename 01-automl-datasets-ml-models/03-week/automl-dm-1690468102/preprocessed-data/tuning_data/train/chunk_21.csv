-1,I purchased this in the yellow for my daughter and she has not seen it yet. the style is very cute  but the fabric is quite thin. she will have to make that call  but if i had bought it for myself  it would be going back. i'm not willing to wear a camisole under a t-shirt. it also feels like the kind of knit fabric that shrinks and skews when it's washed  so that remains to be seen.
0,I own the essential slims and love them  so i figured i could order these in my normal size and they'd fit great. i was way off. they were uncomfortably tight in the calves (which is understandable - i'm a runner so my calves are disproportionately large) and uncomfortable in the waist. i decided to order one size bigger and pretty much had the same problem in the calves. the high waist was also still unflattering and uncomfortable. these might be great for hour glass shape with skinny calves. t
1,I love this sweater! i was nervous after reading the reviews  but ordered it anyway and i'm so glad i did. i got it in grey- the tie back/v-back feature is my favorite part-- flirty and feminine  unique but also subtle. i don't think the material is scratchy. it may not be as soft as some of my other retailer shirts  but i wouldn't call it scratchy. it was perfectly comfortable to me. i will say that it's a little short though. i vary between a m and l  depending on the shirt (5'9  long torso  36c
1,I bought this for my sister. it is perfect for your favorite cat lover  the print is adorable up close but not overwhelming to secretly hide your crazy cat lady intentions. i love this myself  the material is soft and it's a perfect flowy blouse for day to night.
1,The materical is wonderful and light and the color is gorgeous  but the large was absolute gigantic. i'm returning it and sizing down possible to a small  which is unreal  since i wear a size ten normally! i am petite  height-wise  but more than length  there was just so much room width-wise. it swallowed me! the dress itself is lovely  though  so i'm definitely exchanging for a more reasonable size. but definitely size down!
0,"1. i'm 5'5"" tall  140 lbs and 38 (36d) - 32- 40. i'm normally a size 10 in most brands  and in maeve in the past. this dress was too tight across my waist and hips in a size 12  so it runs very slim.  2. this dress is very long waisted  so the top bunched up funny.  3. the horizontal bar in the back is in the wrong place  and will not hide your bra strap.  4. there are bra strap keep loops in the shoulders  but this is an off the shoulder top.  5. the underarms bunched funny.  6. the dress has h"
1,Beautiful top! the body flows nicely and the colors are wonderfully vivid. it goes with everything and looks great for work or going out. my only gripe is the sleeves are really tight. i struggle a little to get on and off but once on it looks awesome.
0,"I really thought i would love this dress the style is really nice and the material is great. however  the length made me feel like i looked short and kind of stumpy. i feel like this dress would look really good on somebody that is more like 6ft  not my 5'6"" self."
0,"I loved the actual design on the fabric. the flowers are gorgeous and i was really looking forward to wearing them  but the fabric was much too thin for me. i was surprised because another review said they were thick. to me  it felt like tights material  almost. however  they were not see through  which is great. overall  they just didn't look great on my body. 5'9"" size 6/8 curves  medium was a bit too loose."
1,Great dress. fits perfectly. will be perfect in the winter and with leggings.
-1,"I was a huge fan of these lovely swing dresses from last year and bought all 3 colors. when i saw this new one  i was thrilled and ordered it immediately. what a disappointment! why did isabella sinclair mess with a good thing? the fabric is a very loose weave sort of ""homespun"" look  which wouldn't be a deal breaker  but i could see it would be very vulnerable to snags. last year's styles had a removable light knit full slip that allowed the airy fabrics to move. this version is fully lined. yo"
-1,I agree with the other review. the fabric and pattern are adorable and well made. the fabric is not sheer at all and great quality;however  the shirt is very wide. i am a 34/26/36 and the small is way too big. the arm holes are perfect but the bottom is uncomfortably large and awkward in appearance.
1,This dress is simply gorgeous. the slit is just right  the colors are great  and most of all the fabric is very comfy! i highly recommend!
0,The snake and the studs  they make the dress. sadly  the snake is hard to find  as mentioned in another review. this dress also runs large  i'm usually a 12 and went down to 10. the images are misleading too. two pics show a small  fitted look  and the other two show a full  swing look. i'm trying to make this work but it may have to go.
-1,"The black and white photo of this sweater makes it look absolutely beautiful. the color photography looked to be a beautiful rich burnt red color. it simply did not match. it was more of an almost faded version of the rich color. the fit was ""ok"". just didn't love it."
-1,Didn't like the dress. look pregnant in it. this dress is going back.
0,This skirt was cute on  but not particularly flattering. i thought the denim was a little too stiff. typically  a-lines are flattering on my figure  but this was a miss.
-1,I was very surprised to see such dark blue sequence on this dress. it did not appear as it did on the photo. i was pretty disappointed by the color. the photo of the dress is much more impressive.
1,This is beautiful tunic for the spring and summer. great paired with jeans or white denim. runs large and is a true tunic length. very pretty fabric and built in camisole  too. only downside is that it probably needs to be hand washed/line dried to keep it looking like new.
1,"Saw this one online and when it came it did not disappoint. i ordered a xxs in black  and it was perfect. i am 5'3"" and 110 lbs. it definitely has a lot of volume to it  but i still found it flattering because the shirt is very sheer  so you can ""see"" through it to your thinner figure underneath. it comes with a comfortable but fitted camisole to wear under it  which makes it flattering. another reviewer mentioned the beading turning. i have not seen that on mine  but now i will be looking for i"
1,This tank i am in love with. the color is great to go with jeans or any color i have in my wardrobe. it works with skinny jeans  culottes or a skirt and perfectly compliments the current shoe styles. my gladiators  summer booties  and my espadrilles are all equally cute with this outfit topper. it is made out of the most beautiful lightweight material and will be great for the 100 degree plus summers that we have here in texas. the bra thing is a bit of a problem because a strapless bra dose not
0,I ordered this top because i liked the look in the back  however  the top i received looks nothing like the back. online it shows that the back has elastic & is gathered. also online it shows thin straps (that look like a bra strap) but my top has no thin straps & no elastic~ extremely odd!! i called customer service but the lady i spoke to didn't have any information or complaints about the top. i'm holding on to the top because it is cute from the front  but i was really wanting the back to lo
0,When these shorts arrived i loved them and was so excited to wear them on my upcoming trip to the beach. the high rise waist is very flattering and the material was extremely soft. the floral detailing was a little more orange than in the picture but i still loved the contrast. the first time i wore these i immediately noticed threads coming loose throughout the day. it was minor but still concerning for an item that was so costly. the real problem arose in the evening when i put on a jacket on
0,I really liked the fabric and the design of this sweater  but the sleeves hung at an odd length (no way to push them up like on the model) and the sweater was large on me. i have broad shoulders but am otherwise petite. unfortunately i had to return this. glad others are having better luck.
1,The top runs small  it is a very sexy and slimming top. i tried in l  it was too small so i have ordered it in xl. i hope it fits because it is very fitted and i am worried that the bottom will roll to the top with a fabric like this. but it is a very sexy  good looking  and slimming top. i love it!!
-1,The back of the shirt has a tag stitched in with red thread that goes through to the outside of the shirt. it is very visible and looks terrible - especially since the back is the focal point of the shirt. do not recommend
-1,Beautiful top  loved the color but shoulders were totally messed up and not sure if it was from  hanging at store or the way it was sewn.
1,The embroidery on this was beautiful but didn't hang well on my athletic/small chested upper body.
1,These pants are great. the pattern is beautiful and the fit is perfect. they pair well with a s front tucked shirt or fitted colwyn neck sweater. another great find from retailer!
0,Lovely color and sweet top  but the fabric was so itchy i couldn't wear it.
1,I was not sure if they would be flattering with the waistband  but i love them. they feel wonderful  yet they are so light. perfect for warm weather. the print takes them from day to night.
1,I got this for my daughter (teen) who had been wanting this plaid look but didn't want to look like a lumberjack! this is feminine and can be dressed up or down. it has the high low look that she loves and it is comfortable and machine washable! she will get a lot of use out of this purchase! new item but black friday discount! yay! purchased in red color.
0,Lots of pairs of the pilcro serif-- and for some reason  after 5mo or less of normal wear  these have bit the dust.   i don't dry my denim and do wash on gentle cycles... this pair just doesn't seem to be too happy. began pilling after two washes  just seems to be a different blend of fabric than the others?     super bummed and now there's no way to replace it. wamp wamp.
-1,"This dress has a beautiful fabric  i really hated to send it back. it was just so unflattering  absolutely no shape to it. i bought a 0p  i'm 5'5"" and 117lbs and it looked like a maternity dress on me."
-1,This looks so cute...but don't be fooled. it is so poofy. it does not look in real life like it does on the model. it poofs way out on the sides and looks ridiculous. i was so disappointed.
1,Super cute jacket .perfect for fall i can't stop wearing it
1,Loved it. i have receive so many compliments when i wear this. it fit great.
0,So small! i was a solid size 12 in skirts but recently lost some weight. i was still nervous to buy a size 10 so i bought the 12 thinking i can always take it in if i have to. the 12 - which should have been big on me was tiny. this skirt is built for someone with non-existent hips. returning.
-1,It is definitely pinned back on the model in the photograph. it made my 5 foot frame look short and wide.
-1,Oh boy...i didn't get this one  and it runs small. too bad.
0,The top as with most of ap's tops is well stitched. material is very uncomfortable. if you have large bust it is a little divulging. this may prompt you to wear something underneath to look modest and change the shape of the top!
0,"I recommen only becuase i like it on other people  but not on me. the pull on style didn't work  i need xs petite to fit lenght and waist  but the waist wasn't elastic enough to ""pull up"" (i have let's say a booty#. i kept hearing hte stiching give... it also looked a little too poooofffy on my frmae  i am 5'1.5"" and it stuck more out than on the model. nice idea  btu not for me. #i am 115 lbs#"
-1,I loved the cut and the stretch in the material made them comfortable  however i found that the material was unflattering for thicker thighs because it tended to cling to the body. it would have been better with some sort of lining as it would have prevented the flimsy material from highlighting imperfections. bottom of pants are not hemmed  so if you want a clean look  you may not like the edges. these were returned immediately as it just did not work for me.
1,Pretty delicate lace top...love it! hits right at waist so not unflattering at hips.
-1,This top really is lovely. i had high hopes of it looking smashing with black jeans. i wash everything before i wear it. though this garment says it needs to be dry cleaned  there was nothing so delicate about the fabric that it had to be dry cleaned. so i hand washed it with delicate soap. when the lighter colors came into contact with the black  the black immediately stained the light color. i tried putting some stain remover on the black stains  rinsed and hung it above my bath tub. it is cur
1,I'm glad i listened to the other reviewers...i ordered a large instead of my usual medium. it's roomy enough for a sweater underneath. i love the denim! it's very soft and has some stretch. my other denim jackets are stiff even after years of washing. i also love the darker denim.
-1,I have a pair of mih jeans that are the only jeans i own that i absolutely love. everything about them. this jumper looked versatile  useful and fun  so i splurged during the 25% off dress sale.  my experience with mih is that the sizing runs true  or european  and thus small. i ordered this in a medium and it is gargantuan as well as virtually shapeless. it looked horrible from every angle: front  back and sides. i cannot imagine it having more fit even in a smaller size.  the fabric is nice  p
0,I love belted sweaters  but this was way too low in front. it hung almost to my knees in front. i'm not a fan of that look.
0,Loved the look of this top. sadly it runs quite small and was very tight where other non-swing tops in a large do not. the item ran out of stock far too quickly. i normally wear a large but feared that the large would be small and wanted to order up but it was already put of stock. the quality and style are great especially for a larger chest. length is great for taller women.
-1,I bought the yellow pair on vacation last week and loved them! i wore them home on the plane and had a pony tail holder in my pocket (basic goody binder)  and there is a circle stain where the binder was! so strange! i sprayed them with spray and wash and washed them. the stain is still there and now it is discolored in the area i treated them! they are ruined! i am so disappointed and i only got one wear out of them!
0,I bought this in navy and love the multi textures and look. i'm happy it was on sale because it is so cute but i would not have paid full price on it. it runs small. i plan on wearing it for casual errand days.
-1,Does not look like the picture. lined with a cheap denim fabric inside that shows when arms are rolled up. i normally always fit in mediums and this jacket is so small in the arms as well as body that it fit like a xs.
-1,I was so excited to try this sweater on when it arrived but to my disappointment  it was overly large! i was pratically swimming in it. really love the design and the way it looks on the model. just didn't work out that way on me.
-1,I was so excited to get this top in the mail. i loved the colors  print  cut  everything. i put it on and was so disappointed  the top looks so much better on the model. i don't know if i should have gone down a size (i go between an xs and s)  but it looked terrible on me! my husband took one look at me in it and said that's being returned. still disappointed
1,I honestly bought this shirt on a whim the other day in my local retailer. i was drawn to the color and the swing. first of all  this shirt is incredibly soft and lightweight. i love the flow of the loose peplum. the straps are nicely placed  because they're wider and accentuate my arms (and cover my bra straps). i love the little v neck detail. it shows a little cleavage when bent or hunched over  but the top stays conservative when truly upright. i wore this shirt 3 days in a row last week  and
0,"As previously mentioned  this dress runs very large. i ordered accordingly  and the small was the right size for my frame  but it was just not flattering. i'm pear shaped  and i found the shoulders to be large  the neck a bit too high  and the overall cut to hug my figure in a very unflattering way. i'm 5'4""  140-ish  and maybe if i were a few pounds lighter and a few inches taller  it could've worked. i so wanted to love this  because it's soft and comfortable and cute  but back it goes."
1,I ordered this skirt online in a size 8 but returned for a 10 so it could sit a bit lower.    the fabric is so beautiful and a bit heavier so it can be worn all year long.  so glad i made this purchase.
0,This is an adorable piece but the fit is a gamble. the crotch hung way too low for comfort on these so since i got a great sale price  i had them altered. i haven't worn them yet but i'm sure i'll get compliments when i do. so if you want to take chance on the fit and/or alter them  go for it!
0,This top is beautiful! but the fabric is really stiff and itchy. in addition  it's rather cropped or short. the real disaster and heart break for me was when i washed it. the tag recommends dry cleaning  but allows for hand washing. i should have dry cleaned - it shrunk even more when i washed it on delicate setting in cold. too bad  because this looks so cute the first time you wear it. if you're up for a dry cleaning bill and don't mind a little stiff scratchy material  you'll be fine buying t
0,"I love the designs of tiny blouses. but i wish they could make them more durable. i have owned several blouses in the past where i have to use a little pin to secure the button line from pulling at the breast area  or that after a few delicate washings have come apart at a seam. and ironing or steaming them is a must. this blouse was no exception. it went back because of pulling at the bust. i'm willing to take some extra care of my clothing out of my busy schedule  but i shouldn't have to! 5'7"""
-1,This is not a kimono. it's a cocoon. there's a huge difference.  it's also not made very well.
-1,This top is really cute  but the threads underneath the shirt scratch your torso. i suggest wearing a tank underneath to protect your skin.
0,I ran to the store to try to this on after seeing it online. i'm usually between a small and medium on tops depending on the shirt; the 6 fit true to size. everything about this shirt fit perfectly and it is beautifully designed  but it is just soooo sheer. i had a nude bra on and you could see every detail of it through both the front and back. i couldn't wear this comfortably without a cami. disappointing as i had the highest hopes for finding a crisp white shirt for the summer!
-1,I ordered this dress in my usual sz 2 it seemed to be tight on the hips   then i tried the next sz 4 and it was tight because  i realized that the lining was very sticky  and would bunch up underneath making the dress look defective on me  not for curvy on bottom. i think if you are more slim down below this will maybe work but i had to return for this reason. i was considering cutting out the lining because it was so cute  and i really liked the look of the dress  if it goes on sale i may purch
1,True to size  very pretty.  as pictured expect that it is more peachy and not this light.  i like it and will keep it but just be aware that it is not a pale pink as in the picture.
1,I saw this dress in the store tried it on and   love! it is so hard to find a white dress that is not too fancy or frilly. this dress fits great and flatters my full figure (size 12 to 14)  plus it has pockets! the woven material with the big fun flowers is accented by the plain band at the bottom which falls just above the knee. the center of the flower adds a nice three dimensional touch. i brought it in a large and i will wear this lovely feminine flirty beauty all spring and summer. from fun
-1,I really love the idea behind this. however  the fit doesn't work for me. i'm usually a s or xs in retailer tops  and i often go with xs for sleeveless tops. this one runs small though - the xs was a bit too small on me based on length and width. the neckline was very high (higher than it looks in the model photo) and the armholes were too big. so i don't think sizing up would improve matters much due to the armhole issue. the other criticism is that the front is not lined.
1,I bought the red motif for my summer wardrobe; i'll be on the road for most of the month of august and wanted to create a super comfortable capsule wardrobe that would launder without ironing. this top is well made  super soft  and works well with jeans  capris  skirts  and leggings due to its longer length over my posterior. i should have read the other reviews first though  this is a tad large and i needed to us invisible tape to keep everything from hanging out the front. i ordered a medium a
-1,I should have heeded the previous reviewer's advice. but i'm really short so i thought i'd give it a try. there is something really wrong with the bust. first  it's about 3-4 inches higher than it should be. the bottom trim cut across the middle of my bust. even if i hoisted everthing up in there to fit the cups  they are really only designed to fit cones  not curves. from the side it looked hideous. too bad  because the fabric and fit everywhere else is gorgeous.
0,I purchased the grey in a medium  i normally wear an 8 or 10 in tops  36 c.. i found it to fit quite well  but it has the shape that seems common at retailer lately in that it is shorter and more boxy. so if you have a longer torso(like me)  you may not be the happiest. i loved the lace and didn't have an issue with that area being sheer  but the non-lace part is very thin. i did try it on with a black bra and it was obvious i was wearing black all around  you could even see the width of th
1,Love this top-i love the colors  flow and that you can wear with a regular bra and straps are covered. i was torn between the xs and s but went with the s due to length. have already worn several times with a casual white jean summer skirt and crops. love love love.
0,The quality of this shirt is great and the colors are pretty. it just made me look super wide. i feel like the waist is too high - not quite empire and not quite at the waist. it just wasn't going to work for my body. maybe a different size would work but i don't like it enough to try.

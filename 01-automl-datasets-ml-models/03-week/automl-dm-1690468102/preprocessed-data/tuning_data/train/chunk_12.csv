-1,This is a great dress if you don't want to leave the house or you want the world to see your nipples.
0,This dress is beautiful as pictured on the model. but on me  not so much. i am normally a size 0/00 with a 32b bra size. i ordered this dress in an xs and it was just too big and boxy. i also thought the material was going to be thicker  but it was very thin and didn't seem to fall right on my body. beautiful design  just not the right material or fit.
1,My favorite pants! they do run slightly large so i sized down. i have 3 colors and will continue to add more!
1,"I saw this vest the week it came in the store. i was hesitant  thinking  ""what do i have to go with this?"" i left the store and had to go back and purchase it. i'm so happy i did! it really does go well simple tops (dressy or casual). it is also perfect for the ""winter white"" trend happening this year!"
0,This top has too much fabric! i would of liked it more if they had a smaller size but the small seemed like a medium or large!
1,"Bought both colors - nice quality top  but they do run large. for reference  i'm 5'4""  115lbs and xs is still kind of big on me. wish they have xxs."
0,I love the style of this top. i just wish there were a slimmer version of it. unfortunately  this top doesn't suit my long  slim midsection. it is so wide  it completely hides the waist. i think it would look adorable on a different body type.
-1,This sweater looked so promising with the tie waist and pretty lacy edging  but turned out to be a disappointment. it was much shorter than it looks in the photos and barely came to my hips. and the plum color was much darker than i expected  more of a dull brownish-burgundy.
0,I wish his dress would have worked. it is beautiful!! however  the waist and bust runs very small. the bottom of the dress does flare out a bit but the waist is so tight that unless you are a stick  everything at your waist and hips will stick out.
-1,I was so excited when i purchased this top! it was going to be my go to for running around  as it looked super cute with leggings and boots! the softness alone made me feel like i was wearing my pajamas.....so comfy! that all changed after one washing......it is now pilling and not nearly as soft as before! makes me sad  but it is going back!
0,"I'm still on the fence with this shirt. i have the grey - it almost looks like a cheetah design up close. i'm 5'3"""
0,This dress is well made and of good quality it just looked a little too old on me. the skirt was heavy and the fabric was cozy  perfect for a fall outfit.
1,Overall i really like this dress. the color is vibrant & unique. the top of the dress especially the shoulder straps seem loose so i'm getting it tailored.
1,I love the oversized look of this jacket--my building is kept freezing cold so while at work i am constantly fiddling with cardigans and scarves and a space heater to try to keep from freezing while working and i thought this jacket would be a great jacket that basically functions as a blanket while still looking professional. (my boyfriend doesn't quite get the 3/4-length sleeves but that definitely keeps the look of this jacket polished--if they were longer i think it would be too much just li
0,I love these leggings - they look and feel great  but i can't wear them out of the house! there is no elastic in the waistband  so they are constantly falling down. i won't dare wear them out  for fear they will fall down when i walk across the street. everything else about the leggings is exactly what i was looking for: style  comfort  and warmth. they are great for curling up to read a good book in front of the fire; not for doing anything active.
-1,"The color says red but it's more like a rust. i'm 5'3"" so it was long and would need to be tailored and the fabric is so thin i was afraid it would rip if it got caught on anything.    finally returned it without it making it out the door :("
-1,This skirt fits in a strange way. there is one pleated area but it is on the side so it is not flattering and i kept feeling as if i wanted to straighten the skirt.. the elastic looks frumpy. unflattering.
0,I wanted to love this dress. i went into retailer in sb to try it on and when i saw it on the rack it looked beautiful  both the print and the material. then i tried it on and it fit like a tent. i am just under 5'5 and it hit right below my knees  not like shown in the picture here. on that note  i passed on this one due to the fit. i think this would make a fantastic maternity dress though.
0,I really wanted to like this  but like other reviews say  the knit fabric pills easily and i don't think the tank feels or looks as good as it would were it cotton. a good deal on sale  but i don't think it will hold up very long. i got the teal/white  as black/white and coral/navy were sold out.
-1,I ordered a medium in this and it definitely fits more like a large. i liked the color & the sleeves  but tying the tie at the neck looks silly on me and leaving it open shows too much cleavage. overall  it is just shapeless and too much fabric on me. i'm sending this one back.
1,The color is deep coral and perfect for fall to top jeans or leggings. i love the big slouchy look so the drapey quality is a plus.
1,I got the top in green  it is very soft and comfy. it does flare out a little if you wear it untucked but looks really cute tucked into jeans or a skirt.
-1,This looks great on the model but when it arrived  i couldn't believe it was the same jacket. it looks a bit like a really loose garbage bag on me and no amount of adjusting drawstrings is going to fix it. i really wanted to like it  but even the xs/s was too baggy. also a bit worried based on other reviews that it isn't actually a rain jacket and wont keep you dry.
-1,Totally see through.
0,This shirt is so cute in the picture but not so great in person. i bought the short sleeve version this summer and loved it! this runs really big so maybe a smaller size will help.
-1,Not a tunic unless the model pictured is 5'1. barely covered my backside and not as advertised. design on top is interesting and the fabric is soft so it's a good buy if 50% off or more.
-1,These jeans are adorable! i'm so sad they didn't fit. my legs are bigger than the rest of my body  but i usually have good luck with wide leg pants. if you are looking for wide legs  these are not the jeans for you!
-1,I loved the shirt until i washed it! awful fabric quality. cheaply made.
0,This is soooo much more cropped than it looks in the picture. the fabric is super soft and design is cute. i really wanted to like this  but it just doesn't fit as shown. the back is halfway up by back and i am shortwaisted...
1,I love this jacket and have worn it to work with a deep chocolate brown t-neck and straight leg pants. i get a lot of compliments on it. i am happy that the double breasting does not bulk up my silouette as that can happen with the style. the boiled wool is fine quality without being thick. the color is true to what is shown. the fit is perfect and what i expected. i highly recommend the purchase.
0,Couldn't wait for this sweater to arrive. i love oversized sweaters for the fall! unfortunately this sweater is extremely itchy that it has to be returned :(
1,I recommend this product if you are tall. the pants fit great but they are too long. im 5'7' and they drag on the ground.
0,"I tried on the grey version in store  and it was significantly longer than pictured. the back came down to just below my knee  which looked awkward with the split sides. i am 5'4"" and this was a regular (not petite) size. however  the overall quality of the fabric was good and it seemed durable."
1,Purchased this for new years eve and an early january wedding. can't say enough good things about it! the lace fabric is soft with the perfect weight. the style is slimming and flattering. although i am short  i have a full bustline and ordered regular rather than petite and it fits perfectly. pants are very easy to hem if needed. needs very little by way of accessories because the lace edging is so beautiful.4 seasons appropriate!
-1,I love these pants. bought them in both black and burgundy. but the burgundy pair split in the butt before i even made it to work in the morning. they weren't even tight. so disappointing. i will be returning them.
1,"One of the more beautiful pieces retailer hags carried in a long time. i instantly fell in love the second i took it out of the box. the only problem is that it runs short in the torso. i ordered the xs and it fit perfectly everywhere except it gave me a wedgie. for reference  i am 5'6"" 120 lbs  and a 34b. i returned the jumpsuit and ordered it in a small. hopefully it's long enough!!! everything about it is true to size except torso length. i have an average torso  so someone with a large torso m"
-1,"This top is crazy in the front and just way-off when it comes to a cross-over drape. the top did not lay flat and the drape over has one snap which seemed to ""bloop"" open constantly. the bottom in the front is a strange combination of layers that i couldn't get to look good.  i'm busty  but this isn't the reason this blouse is just a disaster of a fit on me. the blouse fits tts and everything was covered  so it's not like it was too small and tugged. that's not the case. this blouse just didn't"
-1,"Sadly  this has to go back. i am 5'5""  128 lbs and this shirt is super short on me. very short. and it's so wide it's almost a trapeze cut. the overall effect is 50s/60s style maternity shirt. which is disappointing because the fabric is beautiful  the detail is nice in person  even the sleeve cuffs are great. i am not very tall and i'm fairly thin on top so i can get away with a lot of styles  loose and tight. the combo of short and trapeze is just unflattering."
-1,I tried this on in the store and i couldn't keep it on my body for more then 30 seconds. it's extremely itchy  which is a pity  because i do appreciate the design. :(
1,I love this shirt! it's such a beautiful striking color  yet still simple enough to not take the spotlight. the peekaboo shoulders are totally cute. i bought another one of these when it went on sale. so now i have two just in case;) haha
0,I have been searching high and low for some good quality jeans. sadly i don't think these are it. i love the design and style of these jeans. great length  great cut  great color unfortunately in the 3 weeks that i have had them they are balling and looking like i've had them for 3 years. i'm so disappointed. and will have to continue on my search. apparently they don't make jeans like they used too?
-1,"Would be flattering on someone who is slim with all the right curves. i'm average size and a mother of 3. the medium was not a true medium. the fabric was amazing. the arm holes were too open/low cut for my taste.   i'm 5'7"" and 140. this landed mid calf. not my preference.     retailer accepted the return with a hassel free refund all under 2 weeks from receiving it."
1,"I got so many compliments from friends  i bought another one in different print. packs and travels well. i'm 5'6"" and a heathy 160 lbs  carry my weight in the middle. this dress is very flattering and fabric feels like pj's. also east to wear with regular undies and racer back bra. living in a warm humid climate  it's my new go to dress. the fabric is so stretchy that i found the medium a better fit instead of my usual large."
0,"I just received this dress in the mail today. i ordered an xs and it was huge! there is no way that i could wear a bra without it showing due to the size of the arm holes. i'm 5'2"" and 117 lbs with an athletic build for reference. i love free flowing dresses  but this was over the top. i ordered the plaid version in an xs petite and that fit much truer to size. i reordered this in an xs petite to see if that will work better. the dress itself is lovely. the green color is vibrant and the embroid"
1,I love this dress so much! i got petite and the length was perfect. it was so soft and so pretty. perfect for a wedding.
-1,I read the other review that said the shirt was boxy  i didn't think it would be a terribly big deal. unfortunately  it is. normally i wear a size s  so i sized down o an xs. the shirt fits in the sleeves and neckline  but the shirt is still very box and now super short. unfortunately  this is going back. not a good fit. adorable details but the fit is terrible.
0,Frustrated that the details don't mention there's a side zip. for whatever reason  i have the hardest time fitting into dresses with side zips and so i was annoyed that the details say it's a pull-on style when that's not the case. there's also no give in the waist. besides the fit not working for me  it was a pretty dress but overall a little too much going on.
0,"This top fits like shown in the pictures. however  i bought the rose color and thought it was a little ""off"". would have loved to find the ivory in my size."
1,Easy to wear and very cute  especially for curvy ladies. but  i think it looks best worn with a best  or a blazer on top  something to emphasize the waist a bit more.
0,Beautiful color and softness  very warm  but the front is way too much material. it just wasn't flattering the way i wanted it to be. perhaps on a taller woman this would work.
0,"Agree with other reviewers: this runs narrow in the skirt. the top is also quite low-cut  and it's already lined so i can't see wearing a cami or slip. i like the black-and-white print and the shape  and might have tried a size larger in the store. finally  it's an awkward  unflattering length. i'm 5'4"" and it hit below my knee."
-1,The fit on this is so strange. the middle string is definitely too long and the thin halter top offers hardly any lift. the print is lovely and the quality nice for the price. the cups are padded  which is nice i suppose  but would barely cover anything bigger than a c cup i'm guessing. i'm a 32dd  size 8 in pants  and size 4/6 in dresses and i ordered a medium. i also have a long torso  which probably didn't help.
1,Got these in my usual size and they are wonderful! the gray goes with everything  i'm hoping they come out with some greens or blues too!
-1,This dress is so cute but it's going back. the zipper is horrible and all of the other reviews are true - you'll need to size up.
-1,The neck is so big on this sweater  i couldn't make it lay right. the shape of the sweater is odd. it is really wide on the upper torso  but tapers near your waist. it did not look as depicted on the model. the sweater is a lovely color  i liked the two-tone  but overall the fit was too weird for me. material is soft and it felt really nice on  but just too oddly shaped and a crazy big neck.
0,This sweater is beautiful  especially in the bordeaux color. the cable knit in varying directions makes it interesting and unique and the length is great for us short waisted ladies. my big issue with this sweater is the sleeves. there really are no sleeves  just arm holes at the same level as the hem of the sweater  so you feel as if you need to keep your arms pinned to your sides to keep from lifting the sweater up to expose your midsection  or pushing the sleeves way up  which then results in
-1,Well made dress  but too much fabric for my taste. it lays a little heavy on the body & does not give a slimming affect. the colors are vibrant & pretty  but the dress is too long  as well. as other reviewers have said  the front is too low cut  but turn it around and it looks & feels better. didn't work for me  sadly  i'll be returning it.
1,I received many compliments on this top. it's very cute and versatile. a pair of jeans or a skirt or capris all can work well with this.
-1,I purchased these pants on 12/2/15 as a more fashionable alternative to yoga pants while traveling southeast asia starting february. after about 10-15 wears (with little washing in between as i was backpacker style traveling) the pants wore through in between my legs. the fabric first started to develop little fuzz balls everywhere and then literally disintegrated in places. i tried to sew them to continue wearing them while traveling but alas the fabric had become so thin that the thread could
1,Can't go wrong with these new charlie's by cartonnier. they fit amazingly. the fabric is a textured cotton but doesn't seem to wrinkle. just shook them out of the bag yesterday. the fabric description says cotton and spandex so they have some give (just a little) but are not going to stretch out after wearing for an hour. paired it with all sorts of different tops. side zip is slimming. lined pockets. substantial fabric. nothing bad to say. if you haven't tried a pair of charlies you should. you
0,The skirt part of the dress falls straight and accentuated my stomach. you can't really tell from the pic. but if you have even the slightest bump of a stomach the dress might make it look worse instead of better because of the way that it is cut. i'm pretty slim - 5'5'' and 114 pounds and it wasn't doing me any favors! the top of the dress is beautiful! i will exchange it for something else. i ordered it online and couldn't try it on before purchasing it.
1,I adore this sweater....  so happy that i was able to get one.  get random compliments from strangers all the time!
1,Gorgeous linen blend tee. purchased in grey and white. classic timeless staples. fits baggy which i love. for reference i am 32a 5'1 105 lbs. love love love!
-1,"There's something majorly wrong with the way the armholes are cut. i can't move my arms in this dress. otherwise the fit was fine. the a line cut of the dress is great if ur trying to hide a few pounds. other than that the does nothing for your figure. i found this dress to be true to size in an xsp im 107lbs and 5'1"". don't buy it. i know it's tempting with the sale price."
1,"This top is beautiful on. i did not find it to be sheer in either the black or the ivory  of which i tried both on. i purchased the black as it was more stunning. i am a medium and it fit absolutely perfect. it has a nice pleat in the front  in case you have a teeny bit of tummy. i found it to be very flattering and will wear it as a date top. it will look awesome with skinny jeans or ponte ankle leggings. the body fabric is a lighter cotton. i am 5'4"" and it hits at hip length. it does not have"
1,"These jeans are an even dark color that can be dressed up. the material is soft and they fit perfect. they are mid rise which is a little different for me as i mostly where low rise. the only problem is that they are really long. i am 5'9"" and they are too long for me which never happens. so i need to get them hemmed and wont be wearing them for a few more weeks. i look forward to rocking them with a pair of booties or heels."
1,I bought this dress because i love the cut-out shoulder look and had been wanting to find something with this trend that i'd feel comfortable wearing. the dress fits well and the shoulder cut-out gives it a trendy look. i love the classic navy color. i was originally hesitant to buy it because of the slub material - which i've always thought to be a cheaper  thin cotton. the slub is more substantial than other slub tops i've seen elsewhere  so i was happy about that. still  it is made with slub
-1,I thought these pants were cute! when i put them on  they fit perfectly  and were comfortable  however i wore them for about 20 minutes and they were a completely different size  and looked awful!
0,"This is a beautiful lined jacket  with a much more structured fit than a typical kimono. it hit me at the high hip  not low hip as shown on the model. given how structured it is  i don't think the ""one size"" will work for anyone larger than a small if you want a drapey kimono fit."
1,"I fell in love with this as soon as i tried it on. it doesn't look nearly as good on the hanger  so definitely worth trying on. the fabric is high quality and super comfy; the fit is very flattering. i am curvy  5'7"" and got the navy stripe print in size small. it's very forgiving  fitted without clinging to any ""problem"" areas. i also love how versatile it is--you can wear it as a dress as shown on the models  or as a tunic over tight jeans or jeggings/leggings. love it!"
0,"The fabric of this skirt is absolutely beautiful. however the fit  albeit unique  is not extremely flattering in my opinion. it may be because i am somewhat of a pear/hourglass shape rather than a more straight shape  but the fit is a little off imo. i am 5'8"" and 135# and ordered both the 6 & 8 and felt the 8 fit a little better."
0,Pretty disappointed in this sweater. should have sized down because it's quite wide. i also didn't like the stair step. the back clung to my rear. not attractive. the colors seemed to be striking online but in reality are not. returning mine.

1,This dress is perfect for my florida lifestyle because of the fabric and the design. it is not the color pictured on the web page which was a disappointment. the color is a lot duller. i tried it on in the store and found it to be tight across the chest  another lady who also tried it had the same problem. i went home and ordered a larger size. that dress was baggy and not as cute in the back. i realized because of the under slip it could be left open to the waist and work just fine. i ended up
1,Lovely dress in bright teal color. the zipper was a bit sticky as the other reviewers had mentioned. unfortunately i sized up (6) based on past reviews and had to exchange for a smaller size(4). the fabric does have a bit of stretch so i'm really not sure why so many people had sizing issues. this is really a great buy with the current sale. tempted to pick up the red version too.
0,Disappointed this didn't fit better. the pockets stuck out on the sides  and it was baggy through the middle. you could also see the pockets through the outer layer of the dress. the color is more like a chartreuse than the picture. it's really pretty!
0,There were no reviews when i ordered this tunic so nothing to help gauge fit. it is very cute but the fit is strange - very narrow in the shoulders and chest.
-1,This cardigan is made of nice materials and is lined  but it is boxy and totally un-fitted. i swim  which means i have large shoulders  and this thing makes me look like a boxing champion  well a fat boxing champion as it has not waste-line. the sleeves are too long  and as usual  retailer saves on money by using little cheap hooks instead of buttons as a closing system  so if you choose to close this cardigan  it just looks awful.
-1,Looks like a pregnancy top. a lot gathers in front and back. added 10 pounds to me. not flattering on  much longer than on the model. and the color is not white. it's white with a weird tan/ taupe stripe.  i returned it same day i received it  which was disappointing.
1,What i like about this is the yellow color peeking through the white  it makes the tank look sunny/happy.  soft tank  fabric is really comfortable  fit is loose and casual  i was undecided but thought i have so many nice pieces  i don't need this one . xsp was a good fit. i am 115 lbs  30 dd.
0,I purchased this sweater because of the cute unique diagonal design. however  i was largely disappointed by the fiber of the sweater  it is rather coarse to the touch and a bad fit. on the model it looks nice  but it was large around the torso  yet short at the same time creating an awkward and unflattering fit. i shall be returning it.
0,I put a lot of hopes on this pullover. i needed something for the spring  and it seemed perfect. plus  the sale price is very attractive compared to the regular retailer prices. but... i am not exactly disappointed  but i'd say surprised.     i would still consider this sweater good for spring. it's thin enough to be tucked into a skirt or pants if you like. the pullover is very stretchy - frankly  i would prefer it to be less stretchy  but that might be a plus for someone more busty. the quality
-1,Adorable foxes  i was smitten in the store but the fix is bizarre and the foxes don't come up very high so you're limited in the length you can wear. i bought the m/l based on salesperson advice and i can't imagine trying anything smaller  i usually wear a size s or 4 bottom  these were super snug. back to the store they went.
1,"The patters/colors on this dress are much more stunning in person. it is lined and feels very well made. the pockets don't add bulk to the hip area as many times they do  which is great. the fit can be tricky if you have any semblance of curves. if you can  try this one on in a store before buying. for reference: i am 5'7""  have broad shoulders  am pear shaped (i have hips and a good sized rear end)  34b bust  weigh 145 lbs.  and generally wear a size 6 or 8 for tops and bottoms. the size 8 fit"
-1,This shirt had an overpowering vinegar odor when i took it out of the packaging.    the mint green color was appealing but the styling did not look good and the smell was too much.
0,I so wanted to love this jumpsuit but unfortunately the fit is so off. it runs small and the crotch is to high. the color is beautiful and the design is great. it's really sad i waited two months for this and it was definitely not worth the wait.
-1,I wanted to love this top. perfect weight  length  and shape. unfortunately  the seam goes right through the bust and just does not look right. if you are tiny on top  this will be lovely on you.
1,The color of this dress is sublime. so is the fit. ruching in all the right places. made me feel glamorous. it's a dress that you can easily wear to a holiday party and then still rock it a couple of days later with a sweater coat  vest  or cropped jacket. the material feels so nice against the skin too. it's a must have.
0,This coat is so lovely  it is the embodiment of 1940's classic movie star style. the color  the style  the collar add a subtle flair of drama that you definitely want in your wardrobe .... if only it weren't for those pesky buttons! like other reviewers  i am disappointed to note that within a month of owning  the top button popped off in the middle of a dinner date on a rainy night in a french restaurant. that same night  i noticed a button was missing from one of the sleeves. alas  i am as yet
0,Unfortunately i didnt read the fine print when i ordered this re: dry cleaning only  but this in itself wasnt a total deal breaker. it did fit well -- i am 5'2  32c  107 lb and the xs petite fit very well  definitely form-fitting  not long in the arms or waist. the grey heather design was not my favorite look  actually thats the main reason i am returning it -- there was a dark grey splotch of the heathered design on the chest  and it looked like i had a huge dark stain.
1,Beautiful dress  i like the length and cut. nice material. runs a bit big. i think it'll look nice with a belt. great colors.
-1,I was so excited when i ordered this  i love comfy clothing this looked perfect! when i received it  there was a weird smell with the top. convinced that this could be from storage or something  i washed it. the smell did not go away. i have washed it 3 times now and the smell will not disappear! i have not yet worn but as i have washed it  not able to return it. the top looks and feels great - just the weird smell. now i am 'stuck'!!
1,"I felt compelled to write a review to tell everyone to size up. i am 5'4""  130 lbs  34d and normally wear a size 4 (give or take). i debated between the 6 & 8 after reading the reviews and went with the 8 and so glad i did! if you're in doubt between sizes even after sizing up  go up one more  especially if you're bigger up top. mine fit *okay* in them but probably could have even done better with a larger cup. what's weird is that they sew in liner cups so you can't remove them without cutting"
1,This is a beautiful piece--and a really great deal on sale. it is sheer  but with a simple slip underneath it will work well for a comfortable but special-looking summer outfit!
0,I was disappointed in this bordeaux top  a brand i usually enjoy. i ordered a medium  my usual size in their tops. it was very very big and did not fit at all as pictured here. also  the fabric is somewhat sheer and while i tried it on wearing a darker bra  the combo of being way too large and a bit sheer was enough for me to return it.
0,This sweatshirt is very comfortable and the length of the sleeves is very generous! the bodice is short so you may have to wear a camisole or tank top to avoid exposing your tummy. i usually purchase medium sized tops but had to return for an xl! this runs very small.
-1,Ugh! i am not sure how anyone is giving this good reviews. i tried small  medium and large on and huge huge huge  boxy  fabric bunched at the shoulders and did i mention it's way too boxy? the fabric and pattern are so pretty but the fit is just awful. i would try this one on before purchasing.
0,I was hopeful my size l would fit after another pair of leggings from antrho in this order was too small. these went on easier and i was feeling good until i reached the lower abdomen and everything came to a screeching halt. i'm not sure they are too small  rather  i believe  they are styled to be low-rise. not sure why anyone would want that in a legging  but i'm new to this athletic-wear trend. regardless  i won't be wearing these!
0,I bought the grey t with the design around the yoke. it's cute  but the fabric is a little on the thin side. kind of cheap. i'm glad i didn't pay full price for it. runs true to size.
0,I purchased this blouse in my usual size xl. the wine color is very nice  sort of a rusty cranberry. i so badly wanted to love this blouse but i have to return it. there is so much fabric in the back that it makes me look like a giant cranberry. it is not flattering at all on my full figure. maybe if i was very slender  the massive volume of fabric wouldn't matter but sadly it needs to go back. on a side note  this is a cotton blouse and i believe it is going to require ironing since i badly wri
-1,"Saw this on line and decided to ""splurge"" for the holidays. arrived today and is going right back. runs very small especially in the waist. trim is a cheap ribbed fabric with a zipper. fabric is not elegant looking as in the picture  appears cheap and very itchy. sooooo disappointed."
0,I ordered the light pink version in size xl. the details of the top and the shade of pink are pretty. but  the shirt fits me much shorter than on the model. i'm not quite 5 ft. 6 inches so it should have worked. the material is thin so i was able to stretch it out to give more length. it does look stretched-out now though. i washed it and it shrank a bit so i stretched it again. this is a top that i kept to wear under vests. the pretty colors and the softness of the material make it worth keepin
1,I went ahead and ordered a size up based on previous reviews  but i should have ordered my own size  as they're a bit loose around the waist. the pants are adorable and the pinstripes very flattering  so i definitely recommend them!
-1,Dear retailer & designers:  just want a nice dress that isn't made from polyester! don't mind paying bigger bucks for quality fabrics  but please- enough of the polyester!   love   your customers
0,"Love the cut and the way they drape. size 26 and 5'6"" 135lbs fit great until you wear them for an hour. all of a sudden my 26s became 28s. they were practically falling off. i plan to wash them to see if they shrink. i wish they held their shape since they are so cute."
1,I love this jumpsuit! it runs a little large but still works for me. it makes it super comfy and a great piece for every day!
1,I ordered this on a whim and am so glad that i did. it's a great color shirt and the embroidery is perfect. i like the length of the shirt.
1,I really love this shirt for its versatility. it looks casual with jeans and dressy with a skirt  or even jeans and heels. the shirt itself is super soft. it's boxier than it looks in the picture  but not to the point of crop-top. the shirt still hits at my hips.
1,I wore this sweater last weekend and received so many compliments. not only is this a very pretty style  the poncho is comfortable. i really glad i purchased.
-1,The quality is good  as is the design idea  but  practically  it doesn't work. ordered an xs and the top still ballooned out stiffly. this top is not soft or flowy  it is stiff and very wide.
-1,I agree that this shirt is boxy and has no shape; it doesn't look at all like it does on the model. i returned it.
1,This is a beautiful blouse. great colors and detailing - i absolutely love the design in the back. will look great with white skinny jeans. it does run a bit on the short side but i have a long torso and it still works. i waffled between the 6 and 8 (am usually an 8 and a full b cup).  in sleeveless tops i really like the arm holes to be snug enough to cover that unattractive part between the underarm and breast  so i was considering the 6 but ultimately decided the 8 did so with a bit more comf
1,"I really love this dress! the fit is flattering and comfortable. the fabric has a pale art nouveau background  with indian and middle eastern prints over it. the beadwork does ""really pop "" and the whole is greater than the sum of its parts. for lovers of etro's bohemian style who don't want to spent thousands of dollars on a dress . . ."
1,Was hoping i was going to love this top and i did. its a fun piece to dress up or down.
-1,Guess i should've looked at the pictures more closely. i ordered the white version and in the pictures you can't see that the sleeves are split - and it barely shows in the picture for the blue version. it also would've helped if the detail of the sleeves were noted in the item description. anyway  i will be returning this top because i don't like the way the sleeves look each time i bend my arms. looks a bit pirate-like to me.
-1,"I purchased this and another eva franco dress during retailer's recent 20% off sale. i was looking for dresses that were work appropriate  but that would also transition well to happy hour or date night. they both seemed to be just what i was looking for. i ordered a 4 regular and a 6 regular  as i am usually in between sizes. the 4 was definitely too small. the 6 fit  technically  but was very ill fitting. not only is the dress itself short  but it is very short-waisted. i am only 5'3""  but it fe"
1,"I discovered seea bathing suits last year and fell in love. i currently own two - the hermosa surf suit and the . seea zuma. for reference: i am 5'7""  135 pounds  34c  28 waist. dress size 4-6. pants 6-8. jeans 28. if you have questions about sizing  there is a great reference on seea's website on how to size. if you are taller than the reference sizing they provide  but still the same measurements as another size mentioned  they suggest sizing up as the suits are typically made for surfing/padd"
0,Loved the fabric and details. the cut was a tad looser/bigger than i expected.  perfect dress for fall.
-1,Pretty design and good quality but the medium was very balloony at the bottom. fit my chest alright (34c) but flared out way too much at the bottom.
-1,I was really excited for this jacket to arrive but it's going back. because the fabric is coated  it does not drape or hang nicely at all. i expected it to be boxy but it sticks out so oddly in every direction that it looks horrible. i'm usually an xs and ordered an xs and it looks ridiculous on me.
0,I've been eyeing this top up in the floral pattern for a while and finally ordered it when i had 15% off. i really don't think it's worth the price and it's not very flattering. i think it would look better on someone less busty - it seemed to accent my bust. it's definitely not my favorite piece and unfortunately i will be returning.
-1,If you have anything larger than an a cup  this shirt will likely not fit right. it is very pretty but the seem on the front runs directly in the middle of the chest. it literally runs right through the center of the breasts. what were they thinking? if it had been three inches higher or lower  it would have been perfect. for reference  i'm approximately 105lb and have a dd cup.
0,"I have several pairs of coh and love them all. when i saw these go on sale in my size i quickly purchased them. however  when i tried them on at home and looked in the mirror  i was pretty shocked that the back pockets were extremely long. meaning  they go well below your butt cheeks (like 3""# which means they look like they are sitting too low on your body-and they aren't they are actually i little higher waisted than most coh!     i thought perhaps it was my perception that day  so i waited an"
-1,I was so curious to see this skirt. it looks just like pic. really gorgeous bold pattern and a faux suede like fabric. my only problem was that i thought there was too much fabric. i love maxi skirts. i am 5&#39;8&quot; and 136 lbs. it was a bit long on me but just had too much fabric. i have slim hips but this made them look larger. skirt is almost ballroom gown like in its fullness. loved it and someone else might love it but for me  it was too much. wish it worked!
-1,This shirt is purportedly made of silk  but it is extremely low quality. the material is coarse and scratchy. it's not even worth it at the extra 40% off sale price. returned.
0,It didn't work with my frame at all  but is very nice!
0,This top is beautiful to look at but did not fit me like the model. it was tight across the bust but very poofy at the bottom  which normally i like  but not this time. sad.
1,Love this blouse in yellow! fit is true to size  and it looks a feels great.
-1,I absolutely love mother jeans  but i unfortunately had to return these ones. this particular style seemed to run pretty small. too  i always size up in white jeans  and even the size up that i had ordered were just too tight. i typically wear a 28 in mother  and ordered a 29 in these.
1,This top caught my eye in the store due to the beautiful print and lovely fabric. the photo really doesn't do it justice. i happened to have on a pencil skirt when i tried it on and the top looked great with my skirt though i will probably wear it more often with jeans or pants. it's a stunner!
-1,There's just nothing special about it. it runs small and the fabric is itchy. the design with button caught my eye  but i didn't like it well enough to keep it.
-1,I loved the style so i ordered on line. it runs small and the arm inserts are so low its awkward to wear. i wish the cut was better cause i love the look but not the fit. i am returning this item..
1,I absolutely love this dress... tried it on one size down from my usual...it fit but my size would be perfect and 8 and 10 are out of stock. it's stunning and i love it... i badly have to have it... please bring it back retailer:)
1,I was trying on the cream knit turtleneck midi dress in the store  and wanted the shearling vest shown with it to work for me. the dress is sleeveless  very good looking on  but the vest on me was too much  looked like i was being swallowed by a huge shearling taco. i wanted and needed something to stay warm in without the bulk of a full coat. the stylist brought me this jacket  and it was just the thing for me. its classic and modern  warm without bulk  and the two tone complimented the dress a
0,"This top is a tough one. i ordered my usual medium. i'm 5'7""  165 lbs  34c  and wear a 10/m pretty much all the time (tops and bottoms). let's begin:  the bad: when i tried it on  i found the bust to be too small  and the darting on the sides puckered in a very non-flattering way. the ruffle at the neck stood up more like a mock turtleneck (which is not my scene). also  the fabric seemed a little thin for chambray.  the good: the pattern is adorable. the sleeveless design would be great under bl"
-1,This dress is huge. also  i was super disappointed in the fabric. i thought it would be silly like a georgette. but it was coarse  more like a poplin  and thin. i thought it looked cheap.
1,This top is perfect! very comfortable and flattering for any body type.
1,Although i loved it i feel like its too hip for me! love the material  style  just doesn't look right on me!
-1,This shirt is not a good look for a gal with hips. the fit at the top is tight (i ordered a small) but there is so much material at the bottom and if you are a little taller (i am 5'7)  it hits at a place that is not flattering. i was hoping for something that hung straight down and would be good with leggings. this is not it...also the material is a little stiffer then i was expecting.
0,I really wanted to love this suit  but it honestly looked really matronly in person.
-1,I was disappointed with the style and quality of this dress. it poofs out funny in the waste and it just looks very unflattering. i'm sending it back.
0,Overall  it's a beautiful dress  and i really wanted it to work. but the material feels cheap (at least not what you'd expect for the price)  and as other reviewers have mentioned  it's just a tad too short. for reference  i'm 5'5  125 lbs and the 2 fit well  but hung well above my knees. there's no way i could wear this without unintentionally flashing a few people. sadly this dress will be returned.
0,"I agree with a previous reviewer who said that it was very nicely cut  but unfortunately  the materials are so cheap. the ""fleece"" material that it is made out of feels like the cheap polyester fleece blankets that you get at the discount stores. it will pill easily  and is noticeable even in the dark color. i must have gotten one shipped straight from the store  and it was already starting to do some gnarly pilling. i do love the cut of it  but i can't justify keeping it because this won't last"
0,I was looking forward to trying this on after seeing it in the catalog. i wear an xs or small in retailer tops and tried this on in an xs. it was huge. reminded me of a maternity top. it was much more flowy on me than it looks on the model. the material was nice  thin but not see through. the macrame detailing seemed well made. i'd recommend this if you're looking for a flowy top but definitely size down.

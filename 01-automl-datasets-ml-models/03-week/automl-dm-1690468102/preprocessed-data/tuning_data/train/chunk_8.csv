-1,This shirt was on sale  and it was a good price. that is where the goods ended... the shirt was not flattering. i sent it back asap!
0,I loved this jumpsuit. it fit well on my curvier/athletic frame. i did prefer a belt  which emphasized my shape. unfortunately  it is not lined and a bit sheer. this was a deal breaker for me.
1,I love these pants! they are comfortable and dressy enough for work! the wide leg is the perfect size and the higher waist is professional! these are also nice and long for wearing heels. i ordered a size 27 and they fit great. i normally wear a size 6 in us sizing.
1,I really loved the uniqueness of this dress  and i was hoping to be able to wear it to work  but it was just a little too fitted for the office!
0,I love the pattern and style of the dress  but unfortunately  it's doesn't fit quite right. the top is too loose (the clip doesn't work well) and the waist line of the dress sit above the waist. and the sleeves are tight (which is shocking to me because i have skinny arms).
1,Kicky looking pants  that i got at a bargain basement steal. i'd be kicking myself if i didn't buy them. can't wait to wear them once it warms up. they'll look great with a lightweight  boxy sweater and flats. i tried on the 4 and the 2 and the 2 is perfect. the fabric has a nice  fluid feel to it. i always swore to my husband i'd never wear plaids  but i guess i lied.
0,"I think i received a mislabeled vest?? when i opened the package  i thought it was some sort of joke!  i was expecting what the stock photos show  a longer length flowy sweater vest.... mine was literally child sized. i'm not a big person at all.. i'm 5'6""  135 lbs  and wear a 6/8. i ordered this in a m/l  thinking i would like it loose. i tried it on thinking  maybe it will look longer once on.. no.. not even. i looked ridiculous. the front hit above the waist of my jeans and the back hit middl"
-1,Love the top  but very small to the size. ordered a medium and had to send back in exchange for x-large.
1,This is an amazing dress. beautiful fabric and color. comfortable too. it's like wearing air. sorta chameleon like because this print  literally goes with anything and looks unforgettable on. it's slimming too. i got the large and it flows so nicely over my body. the back is completely open. it closes with a tie at the neck and the waist that drapes beautifully and looks great from the side view. the fabric is a bit sheer so i ordered the white cotton slip by this designer  which is slightly snu
-1,"When i ordered this online  i should have paid more attention to the picture. the dress comes to the knees of the 5'10"" model. i was swimming in small petite size. i checked the label and wondered whether i received the wrong size. nope  it was ps. either the dress was mislabeled  or this is cut huge. returning. too bad because the shape and color are cute."
-1,After reading the reviews i sized down to a 6. once i received it  i loved the fabric and color  however it was so ill-fitting. it's like the designer didn't even use female measurements and used a box to make this top--too wide. i liked it so much that i sized way down to a 0 and it still fit horribly. it is too wide and not long enough. both are going back!
0,This is a lot shinier in person  and the elastic band is really tight but i still selected true to size. there is a hi-lo hem going on that doesn't flatter my legs but it looks fantastic from the side. due to the stiffness of the material and the tightness of the band  it can get crumply on the side if you don't get the right size. the material feels a little thin and scratchy.
0,"I was very excited about receiving this dress. unfortunately i was a little disappointed when i opened the package  as the color was darker than on the picture.  i live in florida where the sun is always shining and although this dress has a beautiful simple design  it isn't for me as the color is too ""winter""."
1,I bought these leggings for yoga. i love them. the material is so soft and also seems sweat wicking which is a plus. the back detail on the calf is a nice touch of flair compared to basic leggings. the waistband is wide and did not fold over during practice! for reference  i am 5'4  130 lbs and i purchased a m. fit was great. i normally wear size 27-28 in pants. would recommend.
0,I found both colors and jumped on this shirt. then i got it home and realized that it was pretty much useless. there is no way to put a sweater or jacket over it  it is too hot to wear in the summer  putting a tee under ruins the look.  i am very flat chested so it hung well  but there is lots of shirt. both went back in exchange for two wearable items.
-1,"This dress did not work well on my figure. i have a small waist and broad hips  and the dress (size m for 140 lbs  5'8"") was too boxy. i didn't have objections to the fabric  like other reviewers - honestly  even if there were a snag or two  the fabric is kind of rustic and i don't think a snag would look terrible  depending on where it is. i should note that one of the ornamental buttons immediately fell off the dress upon arrival. my friend got the same dress in a size s and it worked better f"
-1,Agree with other reviewer that this is massive even for a cape. unflattering overall. i normally wear a size 2 of 4 and bought this in an xs and two of me can easily fit into this with room to spare. unlined and it itches!
0,I took this too to the register thinking it was marked down to same price as another tee by the same brand. it wasn't so i ended up paying way too much for a thin tee. will probably return.
0,This top was so pretty online! unfortunately it did not work for me- the front was a bit more shapeless in person  though the back was gorgeous  with a button gather at center. the color appeared yellow online  but was a bit more green in person. also  the armholes were very low  so it would need a camisole or no bra.
0,I agree with the other reviewers; this sweater was strangly shaped in the waist  in an unflattering way. the rest of it was beautiful though. looks too much like maternity  even in a petite xs  so it's going back.
1,I bought this with the intention of taking it on a very warm trip - and i think it'll do just fine! it's a wonderful open-gauge knit - delicate and light  but substantial enough that i don't fear snagging it constantly. the cloth has a nice weight and drape  and while the fit is on the loose side  it does look intentional. wonderful as a pullover or by itself. i have the minty blue-green color  and it's divine. definitely worth the price.
1,Wore for the 4th with white jeans super cute love the ruffle
-1,Runs large. very boxy. white fabric on lower portion of the shirt extremely thin. it did not look as good as in in picture. very disappointing!
0,Sheer and lightweight. perfect for summer. great detail could not justify paying full price.
1,I got this dress on sale (under 20 dollars) but i would pay more!  it runs very large - i got a medium which is roomy  irl i wear a large (vanity sizing i suppose!).  the colors are so pretty  it is lined so you don't need a slip or cami.  highly recommend!
-1,"I agree with the other reviewer that the belted part definitely gives some great definition for those with a defined waist and that it's a much lovelier color in person  but that's about it for me. thoughts below:  _____________  pros:  - tts. i ordered the medium for my 36c  5'9"" frame and found it sufficient.  - the color is much nicer in person  as the other reviewer mentioned. it's a richer brown. think ""mocha latte"" in terms of color.  - the belt really helps tie it all together and keep it"
-1,I was really excited when i ordered this dress for na upcoming beach vacation but was very disappointed when i finally saw it in person. it reminded me of those christmas nightgowns from the 90s with the red and white ruffles. pass!
-1,I really wanted to love this but the cut was very wide  short  and crooked. after it was washed once  it was completely unwearable because it hung all wrong.
0,Yes  i bought this dress in anticipation of wearing it right away. it's not mean for everybody. it would look good on a stick figure. if you have some hips  they balloon out.
1,"I'm 5'8"" small 115 pounds. ordered the xs. this dress is gorgeous! my husband loved it! i tried several sticky bras... nothing worked. i'm 32dd   i gave up. if your ok with no support  you'll love this dress. sexy back  perfect length  so light!"
-1,Huge bummer. this top is definitely a crop/midi-top. plus  it's cream  not white like shown in the photos. i'm returning it today.
1,I really love everything about this cardigan. the detailing at the bottom part of the arms adds a lot  the color is highly versatile  it is a thicker fabric so it keeps you warm  and my favorite part is that it is long. i like longer cardigans that you can easily pair with skinny jeans. the only drawback is there is no way to close this cardigan  likely if i end up purchasing this i will also purchase some sort of broach to pin it with or pair it with one of the belts i have from retailer to
-1,I had a dress that felt like this in 1993. it jiggles  even if you don't. no amount of spanx can cure a dress jiggling of its own accord. the neckline that i had thought would be classic instead veered into frumpy. all in all i felt like it belonged in a discount store surrounded by polyester brethren.
1,I tried this on at antho today and loved it! the pictures online are not doing this garment any favors. it is flattering in person. the fabric is a light fabric-i was a little disappointed in this since i like things to be a little warmer  but this is probably better anyway with spring coming (it is coming  right?-today it's snowing) i like the under-layer that is kind of silky which i think adds a special touch to it. it is versatile and could be paired with anything.
-1,I'm so bummed! i absolutely loved the pair of these i bought in the bronze color great fit  great color  so comfortable! however  i just washed them and could tell right away when i laid them flat to dry that they had lost color in areas where they had wrinkled in the wash machine. so  now they have strange lighter lines running along them. not acceptable.     i will say that the two lighter colors may not have this issue. for reference  see my stats. i bought a 26.
1,I adore this skirt - it is so soft and flowy. i was not sure if the mesh would be a bit stiff  but it's not at all. the dots are soft as is the main fabric. i could wear this all day long and be very comfy. the underlying fabric is a bit more taupe than gold in color. i am between sizes to i sized up and was glad i did- no pinch at the waist. i love that it's feminine yet funky and could be worn formally or in fun. it is midi-length  as you see on the model. absolutely a great buy!
-1,"I have been looking for an off-white vest and thought this one would be perfect  except it is going back. i am 5'9"" 150 lbs. medium is my normal top size  but this medium was tight even though the design looks relaxed in the picture. no buttons  so no way to close it. unlined and the design and fabric look more casual than the photo. not worth the price."
-1,"I purchased this swimsuit in the mint. gorgeous color combination. i'm 5'5"" and weigh 117 lbs. i purchased a small. the fit is true to size. i love the front design; however  my husband promptly brought the back of the swimsuit to my attention. the chevron was off center. the design should have been centered with my back; however  it was on the right side of my back. i immediately called retailer assuming the product was defective. the item was sold out on line; however  a supervisor was able to l"
-1,While the print is cute  the fit is a disaster if you are a c cup or fuller. the bottom band does not lay flat as pictured on the model (it rides up under your boobs) and the whole cup area tips forward - it's not really molded like a bra  more flat foam insert. immediately went back. hopefully  if retailer continues to do swimwear  they'll take a look at adjusting the designs to make sure they're also workable for fuller cup sizes (underwire please!)
1,I ordered this dress looking for something to wear out for an evening. after seeing the other reviews i wasn't sure about it  but i was very pleased when it arrived. i find it is elegant and sexy  but also modest enough when i sized up by 1. i normally wear an xs in dresses but found the small fit perfectly. it is form-fitting particularly in the waist and back without being too tight. i'm excited to wear it and think it would look beautiful with a long necklace.
-1,The dress is beautiful in pictures  but all the reviews are dead on...it was full of snags when it arrived! 8 snags to be exact. and the fabric was heavier than i expected. sadly  had to return.
-1,"This is a really cute dress  just did not look flattering on me at all. i suppose i could have gone down a size  however i just did not love it. i am 5'3"" 130#  athletic build  36dd. i read the other reviews and everyone loves this dress. here is what i did not like. there are pockets  which i cannot figure out the purpose  that lay oddly all bunched up right at the hips. due to the shape of the dress  it bunches out. on my short frame  it made me look shorter and wider. the fabric is a lightwei"
1,This dress is great! the fit is perfect and very flattering. the two colors and asymmetrical hem on the front make it different than you average sundress. looks great with flip flops  sandals  wedges or booties. will be a great piece for summer but the darker colors also make it the perfect transition to fall dress.
0,I got this dress in the mail  and while i loved the concept of it  it really is too boxy. the tie is very superficial and does not really nip you in at the waist  it is more so for show. it is fully lined which was interesting  and to me  made the dress seem boxier. the quality is good  but i am an hourglass and this was completely unflattering. i would have had to size up to make it look like the model shot  but it would have still been a shapeless dress  just bigger. it does fit true to size 
1,"These are the best trousers i have bought in a long time! i'm 5'8 and 145 pounds and the 8 fit with a bit of extra room in the waist--not enough to size down. i love that they are not ""skinny""--so over the skinny fit. i plan to wear these with black heels  white tee  and the vegan black leather jacket i purchased at the same time--oh  and a statement necklace--always a statement necklace. these are a must for every fall wardrobe! more pants like these  please!"
-1,This looks cute in the web photo  unfortunately it is absolutely huge in person. i got the small and have to return it because it is not wearable for me.
0,I love these pants -- bought them in the mustard color. my only complaint is that they are not colorfast -- i washed them in cold water with other colored items -- most of which belonged to my husband. not good -- and pretty much ruined an entire load of laundry except for these pants. retailer -- please color test your garments. there is really no excuse for fabrics like this to run in this day and age!
0,The dress fits true to size and is pretty comfortable. i did look kinda matronly with my 34d chest. it's a good basic to have on your closet  but i ended up returning the one i bought. it didn't feel special enough to keep.
1,I love this top soooooo much! i love straps and i love tops that will show some of my sports bra in the back  since i tend to buy some that have some strappiness. i love that this top has it all-it is lightweight  and it has some character so it is more attractive than an everyday kind of workout top. it is comfortable  even for classes like body pump where you are constantly moving your arms. i love that the colors are not bold  i am sick of neon!!!!
0,For the price of this tee the beautiful front lattice work should have been extended onto the back. would have been a classier  more finished looking garment. if the cost is not an issue then this tee makes a nice neutral addition to a neat but casual summer look.
0,Ok so this top is as cute in person as it is online. runs very small as theres no stretch or give in fabric. i normally wear 12 and i couldnt even halfway get this on lol. i may consider a 14-16 but the stores didnt have this yet to try on. the ladies at the counter were crushing on this top though! if you can find your fit this top is great for layering!
-1,It's thin knit with a unique and pretty neckline  but unfortunately it's scratchy will not last. i just received it and it looks like it would fall apart after a few wears. it's a nice shade of offwhite at least. for me it's a no that will get sent back straight away.
1,"I think this top works best for a petite person. i am 5'1"" and 106 lbs. the xs is perfect for me. i love it so much  i purchased it in more colors. i machine washed and line dried. it washed beautifully."
-1,This blouse is a disappointment . fabric is cheap looking and the cut is very off. just odd. sleeves awkward . the back of the white shirt on the on-line model is not the same as the white shirt i received. mine was plain in the back like the blue shirt on line even though my shirt was white. no ruffle. returned.
-1,"The fabric  colors and concept are fabulous but the pleating is overdone is it looks huge not swingy! i am 5' 9"" and 135lbs. and even an x-small was too billowy to be cute. too bad- it's otherwise so great!"
0,"I have this suit in the ""tile"" pattern and i love it. i am a breast cancer survivor and this suit is perfect for as it covers a little issue i have on the left. so i ordered the ""mint"" pattern. the colors are beautiful but the pattern is off. the ""v"" pattern on the front is not centered. as a result  my body looks a little lop-sided. i looked carefully at the suit on the model and noticed it was slightly off center on her also. however my suit is quite a bit off-center. it's too bad  because the"
0,"I took a risk on this dress despite the multiple reviews about the pouffy skirt and revealing neckline  because i loved the look of the blue motif print. alas  the adorable print  the handy bra-strap holders  and super-soft fabric were the only things that worked for me. i'm 5'3"" and 120 lb  small up top  not especially curvy but not straight either  and i ordered my usual 2p. yup  the pleated skirt was much too full (i felt as though i was wearing a cheerleader's skirt) and the neckline was way"
1,"I am so in love with this dress. i think it is made of high quality fabric and very well designed. i am 5'6""  about 145lbs  34d and the 4 fit perfectly! i bought it for my upcoming bridal shower and could not be more excited to wear it!!"
-1,I have other stevies  and these are nothing like them. the quality is very synthetic to a point that the material is shiny. the pants themselves run very small in the waist  approx. two sizes too small compared with other stevies. additionally  the cuff is sewn like that in place  and hits at an odd spot if you are taller or have strong calves. see how it gapes in the cuff on the model? like  a rounded bottom? that is way more emphasized in real life. buyer beware!
1,I ordered this shirt last week  it's beautiful!!!!! it's even prettier than the photo. i'm 5.3 120lbs  i ordered the petite 6 and it fit perfectly!!!! i wish it came in more colors  i'd order another one in a minute!
0,I have a dress very like this from retailer's fall line.  i love it  so i decided to try this one. the fabric is thinner than the other dress  which is good for spring  but it also seemed not such a great quality. i also didn't care for the texture. if this doesn't bother you  the pattern is very cute and the style is flattering. it is cute with a blazer.
1,Great as a beach coverup. i paired it with a slip underneath and a belt and it looks amazing! can't wait to wear it on the beaches of the bahamas soon!
0,I love all whimsical prints and shirtdresses and wanted so badly for this to work!  i'm an athletic person with more of a pear shape so a-lines really work for me.  i got my usual size 2 in this dress  and while i felt like the waist was true to size  the top gapped so badly (i'm a 32b) that i had to return the dress.  a tailor probably could have done something to it  but i decided i did not want to mess with the extra expense.  too bad  because the fabric is a lovely weight  the length was per
-1,This top was too big for me. 5'4  135lbs and ordered xxs. fit was fine and wanted it too work  but too overwhelming on me as well. will be going back.
1,Love love love this mock tank!!! goes fabulous with everything! it's flows nicely the mock neck looks fantastic! you can probably go one size down.
1,Wasn't sure whether i would like the top from the online picture  but it is so much more flattering in person. can be worn as a casual piece with denim skinnys or dressed up with a pencil skirt.
1,"Nice fit and color and i love the tall cuff but you will need to size up at least two sizes.  as the previous reviewer stated these jeans do run extremely small.  i usually wear a 27 ag in jeans  sometimes a 28 for the ag legging jeans but the 28 in these were still very tight all over  and uncomfortable.  i don't like my jeans skin tight so i had to go up to a size 29 but they fit and look great.  sizing definitely off on these.  i am 5'3"" 115# for reference."
0,Not a huge fan of this dress  will be returning it. fits too big and not flattering. fabric is thin and shows any lumps and bumps you may have. color is not as pretty in person as in the photo - the photo looks like a nice rust color but the dress is actually a boring brownish olive.
0,I am so in love with this skirt  but unfortunately it runs at least one size small...since i am a 16 there is no sizing up. the color  quality  and style are perfection but i would say this runs as more true to junior's sizing than a regular women's size. so sad because it will be going back.
1,This dress is comfortable  hugs and skims at all the right places  and sports a perfect length for a shortie like me. wish the other patterns weren't sold out.
0,More importatn  super soft matieral and comfortbale  hwoever  when i put it on  ilfelt like i was wearing a robe... i do like the detial in the fabric  but jsut dind't feel right as cardigan. maybe purchase if you are looking for a light robe.    true to size  tried on xs  maybe petite would work too.
0,I order this shirt because it looked like a shirt you could dress up or down. when i got it the shirt was really wrinkled. therefore  i knew it would have to ironed a lot. it was quite boxy and was shorter in the front then in the back. i didn't realize that this shirt was two different fabrics. overall i think this shirt would be more flattering on a woman that was petite.

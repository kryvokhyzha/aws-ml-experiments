1,"Upon entering a local retailer store  i saw this top almost instantly and decided to try it on.   fyi: 36c  broad shoulders/back  high waist  5'3"" (almost)  and i normally wear a 12 in a fitted  button-up shirt. i can go down to a 10 in a loose-fit one  but with the buttons i wouldn't expect this to be ""loose-fitting"". i wear a m or l in a knit top. i tried this on in 12  but it was too big in the armholes and chest  causing the top to stand out too much from my body. when i tried on the 10  these"
-1,I was sooo excited to buy this top and it was such a bummer. this top hangs so poorly and is so droopy under the arms. it's clearly poorly made and the sizing was way off on me. i ordered my usual medium and it was so large and wide that i had to return it. it weirdly fit perfectly in the shoulders and arm length as mediums do for me but was so wide and unflattering for my figure (5'8 and athletic). i really wanted to like this top and considered ordering a small to see if it would fit better bu
0,I got the m/l and it's huge. usually wear a large. so size down! it's a striking top. but i decided not to reorder because i don't really need another short sleeve top. i tried it under a cardigan and of course it looses its appeal because you can't see the floral design. had to return.
1,Absolutely adore this jacket. i'm typically a true medium at retailer and the medium fit perfect. the small actually fit really well to and had a little room for sweaters under it but i decided to stick with the medium just so i could bundle up if need be. so perfect and beautiful  the embroidery is gorgeous  i feel so feminine in this coat
0,I can't believe how small these are. i almost wondered if the size was marked incorrectly. these are so pretty and such a shame because i love them. the rise in the crotch is also very short. very full in the legs and one is longer than the other:( the stripes don't line up in places which is also disappointing for this price!
-1,I purchased this top on sale and was really excited about the style. it fit great the first time i wore it. i washed it once  according to the care instructions. after washing it in cold water and allowing it to air dry  it was basically ruined. it shrunk up in length widened out about two inches. i'm pretty bummed about it because it was cute.
-1,I wanted to love this as i love holding horses but it fits weird  slender in arms but baggy in the torso. i will be returning
1,So super soft and comfortable - great to throw on to run errands with ease while still looking stylish - the lace up front makes it more special that just a standard tee shirt dress
1,Best beachy summer tunic in the store. can be worn knotted at the hip or worn straight. can be worn over jeans  shorts  a bathing suit  take your pick. wear it with a tank/cami underneath or not. it works wither way. asymmetrical cut. great for us long-legged tall people. fabulous buy. only con is that it's a tad delicate. unfinished hem and loose-knit. will easily snag if you aren't mindful. i recommend hand wash  air dry.
-1,This sweater did not flatter a sz 12 with 36d chest. it's very well made but not for the curvy girl. this is my very first review and felt compelled to share my thoughts since i heavily rely on others' reviews before i purchase.
0,"I bought these in the blue. i sized down  as other reviewers mentioned  going for an xs. i'm 5'5"" and about 130lbs and would usually buy a small. at 5'5"" the length was too long for me  hitting me below my ankles  rather than how shown on the model. strike 1. then  i felt the material was pretty thin - strike 2. and lastly  they hung a little funny on me  rather than being a bit loose like jogging pants should be - strike 3. despite the great sale price  these went back!"
-1,Pilcro stet roll ups are my fave! i have about 5 or 6 pairs and i needed a replacement for my light wash so i went in the store and tried these on. wow has the quality changed. the denim is a lot lighter in material  now  the wash isn't as real  almost like i'm wearing jegging shorts. these were my favorite but now i'll have to look for light wash denim shorts elsewhere because these new ones just wont cut it anymore! why  pilcro?? the sizing is about the same  they run a little large due to the
1,Just gorgeous . this is one beautiful top. the colors are pretty and vibrant. i wear either a large or xl and the large was great in this top. dress it up or down.this top flows and it drapes beautifully in the back. it looks fantastic with jeans. as a bonus it is lined so no need for any type of piece under it. it's an all year round top. throw a cardigan or wrap over it when the weather cools down and you are set to go. a great top for your wardrobe . i would not hesitant to buy it.
0,"I think the model is wearing a larger size  per the first review. i am 5'2"" and 105 lbs and the xs fits about the same in length but not nearly voluminous. so you should order up if that is what you want. this will be perfect for some long summer flights instead of a wrap  since the sleeves will be more convenient and i always look schlumpy rather than elegant in a shawl! if it had some cashmere or another softer fiber i would be totally in love with it."
0,I wanted to love this sweater but the fit is off slightly. i ordered my regular size xs and the chest/shoulder area fits nice but the waist comes very tight and not flattering to wear unless style similar to the model with a tucked in look. nice color and decent quality fabric but not my favorite fit. going back to the store.
1,I saw this skirt online and immediately went to the store to hunt it down.  is perfect!  one of the most beautiful items of clothing i own.  was worried the waistband would be unflattering since i'm short and curvy but it's very flattering.  can dress up or wear to the beach.  i love it!!
0,"I wanted to love this dress. i am not comfortable wearing dresses much above the knee and i liked the length and the way this looks on the model. however  in person this dress is cut like a sack. it is not tapered at all in the waist and there is just too much fabric when you cinch the belt  at least on me. it was oddly shapeless  even with the belt. it seemed a size too large. i ordered the xxsp. for reference i am 5'1"" and 107 lbs. i ordered the neutral dress and i really like the fabric and c"
0,Was not flattering on my body - i have a fuller figure  and this just made me look like i was pregnant.
1,"The quality of this vest is outstanding  and the warmth is exceptional. i have worn it as a jacket on milder days  in work as a warmth layer and brought on vacation to act as both plus a bathrobe. it is a very stylist piece that can be worn open or belted. it runs large by style  but i am 5'1""  100 lbs and i can carry it off."
1,This definitely works for you - think fabric  great quality  and i'm 25 weeks and i think i'll be able to use this to the end. got my normal-ish size. would never have kept this if i wasn't pregnant  cause you can definitely accommodate a pregnancy (or maybe go down two sizes if not). this is not my first baby either! love for my pregnancy.
1,This top is light and airy  but substantial enough to wear with shorts away from the beach. its definitely not too sheer to wear without a bathing suit. i was actually pleasantly surprised at the flattering fit. it runs slightly big  but the top is fitted enough that its not shapeless. the colors are beautiful and the embroidery makes it special.
1,So simple to throw on with jeans  or you could dress it up. the ruffles give it a little extra flair. nice and soft  really comfy. i haven't decided which size i am going to hold onto. i ordered in a small and a medium. small fits me great  and i am usually a pretty standard medium. i think it just depends on what look you are going for.  wish they had it in a lighter color  like an ivory or pink.  i think the ruffle detail would look nice with a lighter shade.
0,I am totally on the fence with this shirt. like the other reviewers  i sized up because my normal 14 was too tight in the chest (a common problem for me). the arms are strangely tight and i didn't get much more room in the bust with the 16. but then the bottom of the shirt tents away and hangs funny. this is obviously meant for those with a very small bust who are on the slender side. i love the pattern and material though  so i'm going to visit my trusty seamstress and see if she can place dart
-1,The pleats on the bib make this look like something from chloe sevigny's wardrobe on the set of big love. and the shoulders are cut for an offensive lineman.
-1,Unfortunately this one is going back. the fit is very flattering and the underlying layer is very revealing in the back.
-1,This shirt looks nothing like the fit in the pictures. it is short and very wide. i had read the previous reviews and thought i could take it in on the sides some but it is literally the shape of a trapezoid.
1,"I can't get enough of maxi dresses and i can't resist tracy reese. this stunning dress caught my eye immediately  but i was worried that the back cut out at the waist would make my backside look flatter. i'm so glad i took the plunge to buy before it sold out. this dress fits perfectly  it's flattering to my figure  the print is beautiful  the fabric and drape do not cling to my figure flaws and i'm just so happy! for sizing reference here are my stats: 5'3"" 140# 36dd and i purchased the medium"
1,Very different. i love the unique design and it is appropriate for various settings .
1,"This is a very cute and unique cropped jacket. the attention to detail is excellent. i am normally a small but had to size down to an xs as the style is a bit boxy and to make it more fitted/tailored  an xs looked better. i am 5'5"" 118 lbs  34c  slim athletic build. it is a chic alternative to a cardigan on a cooler day."
0,This shirt is really pretty but the sleeves are so small. i normally wear between a 4 to a 6 or a size medium and i could not get this shirt on. i wish it fit but a size large would have been way to long and loose.
0,This fit well  but the top was very see through. this never would have worked for me. i'm glad i was able to try it on in the store and didn't order it online. with different fabric  it would have been great.
-1,"This is a very lovely looking sweater. unfortunately  it runs incredibly small. i'm only 5'3"" and the size small hit me above my mid-rise jeans. it doesn't fit at all how it's shown on the model. it's also a very delicate fabric. seems like it would snag easily. i was really hoping it would work as i used my birthday discount to purchase it  but i'm sending it back."
-1,This could have been an amazing chemise but it is too short even for bed- perhaps it could be used for a tank. i am 5'3 but do have a long torso. it did not fully cover my booty.
1,I am amazed this is still on sale. it's so comfortable and fabulous!!
1,Nice  thick material. cream has lining underneath which i appreciated so that it's not sheer in the light.  flattering design
-1,I love love love this print and had to have it when retailer had their 25% off sale. i think regular price is way too much for this dress as the dress isn't even silk or a better material. but once i got this i was so disappointed  i ordered my usual size and it was just a balloon/tent on me. i felt like i was wearing a maternity dress. plus the ruffle at the top which i thought was a sweet feature felt really awkward and like it was grazing my neck and chin in an annoying way. i don't even want t
-1,I bought this dress online and was hoping it would be a great comfortable staple.. it may be the most unflattering piece of clothing i have ever tried on ever! i let my sisters try it on too  to see if they wanted it or liked it better  but it was awful on them as well. i ordered the xs in blue. it was beyond enormous and was just plain and unflattering. i am 5'7' and 115. i love swing dresses i just don't think is cut well.
-1,I loved this skirt on the rack. but it was not lined and super scratchy when worn. i could barely wear it for the length it took to try it on. so sad. such a gorgeous skirt.
0,"I wanted so badly to love this sweater. the colors in the blue motif are fabulous and the yarn is soft and warm. but it does not fit me in a flattering way. i can't recommend a size  because the s and the m were exactly the same size and fit. the neck is broad and bulky and overwhelming  the sleeves have bulky cuffs that come down to my fingers  and the sweater slides across my shoulders. i'm 5'6"". it appeared overstretched  and i feared it would only stretch out more over time and not be worth"
0,I normally wear regular s  but even the xsp is too wide on me. it is really maternity wear.     also  since the material is thin  the ivory is too shear for my liking.
1,While shopping with my daughters  i bought this tee in white. i immediately felt guilty for spending too much on a white tee that was thin and see-through enough that i'd need to wear something underneath. i returned the white  but then retailer had a sale weekend  so i ordered the blue with a discount  so less guilt and the color is beautiful. i don't need to worry about wearing anything underneath - the fabric is very thin and super soft and feels so nice.
0,I purchased these in large which is normally my size on bottom. they are a little roomy and the waist is so high on me that i am going to tack the waist down. they are ok. good quality but not the best pants in the world.
1,Another cloth and stone success! love the back! denim goes with most anything!
-1,I usually buy xs or s in retailer clothing and the pieces usually fit perfectly. this time i purchased my first petite item because i was worried the length of the pant leg would fall at an unusual spot if i didn't. i'm 5'4 and i ordered a petite small. i was swimming in it. the elastic in the back was so loose you could see directly down my pants. i wanted to love this but unfortunately the size did not work for me.
0,I'm a pretty solid 10/12 in this brand. i went with the 12 since some thought the top to run small...and i agree. while i can wear it and think it will actually stretch out with wear  it's tight in the shoulders and chest. for the record  those are 2 areas i never have problems with. i'm a 36b and it was flattening my chest. it was also quite short on me. i have a short torso and it was barely hitting below my belly button. the shirt felt more like a size 8 than 12.
0,Such a cute dress it was just way too big in the back of the dress  too much fabric  it just hung with  no form around waist. it appeared more fitted on the model than the one i received. dress was quite  a bit longer in the back so i felt like the front was riding up just in the minutes of trying it on.   sadly i have to return it. it did come with an underneath slip which was necessary as the fabric was very  thin.  recommend with caution to sizing.
-1,Loved the colors but the fit was less to be desired. very wide under arms & too much material. looks more like a maternity dress. i ordered a small petite & would have needed the xs but now it is no longer available. oh well. returning this.
0,It seems this coat could have been manufactured under a smaller spec size because the size large looses shape and where it hits on the waistline is unflattering. quality is high however
-1,I know this is supposed to look oversized  and i own a few oversized ponchos  but this takes oversized to a whole new level.  i ordered it in my usual size and it was just waaaaay too much fabric - i do not think sizing down would have made a difference.  if you are looking for that  it seemed like good qualify.
1,I absolutely love these sleep pants. they are very comfortable and the cute tea cups print makes them fun. i have washed them and put them in the dryer and they didn't fade or shrink. grab a pair while you still can you won't regret it.
0,I liked the product shots of this cardigan  but when i opened it up out of the package i was kind of ...unimpressed... the green wasn't quite the color i was expecting  the fabric was rougher  the lace was scratchy  the fit was boxy  and the sleeves are very dolman... none of which translated through the pictures online... i still think it's cute  but it has a much more casual look to it than i was expecting. i might reconsider if it hits sale  but for now it goes back...
-1,I generally don't spend this much on jeans but wanted a nice black pair so rolled the dice during the sale. who can wear these? i'm an average size 12 and struggled to get these size 32s over my hips  buttoned and zipped. i looked like a stuffed black sausage. best for thin frames and even then  size up.
-1,This jumpsuit is so cute and it looked amazing on. i had to return it because of the poor design. it was extremely hard to put on and take off! there are so many buttons to do and undo which are not as easy as snaps! the fabric buttons definitely make a great look to the jumpsuit but there should be a zipper on the side for easy access  or use snaps instead of the loops for the fabric buttons. what a shame of a lovely and classy design on a good quality material  but not worth it if it's difficu
-1,Retailer consistently provides unique  sophisticated and quality made clothing. with the exception of an occasional purchase at their sister companies  i shop with them exclusively. i suppose that i can't expect 100% perfection from retailer-but 99% of the time-that's what i get. this is that 1%...this sweater is truly awful! i cannot (or find it very difficult at least) begin to describe what this sweater is like but it is so unlike retailer that  had it not been for the distinct pattern on the front
1,This was another unusual choice for a larger busted woman like myself  but i couldn't say no to that sweet little back detail. i'll attack the waist with a cropped jacket. for those looking to add volume or flowy fabric  you've found your answer and then some!
1,"Looking for the perfect camisole that smooths the flab  keeps you warm or cool as appropriate  doesn't ride up  and looks good? this is it! it takes a bit of extra effort to get this cami over your head and pulled down  but once you do  you say ""ahhh!"" it feels good and is a blessing--a seamless bit of control of middle-age  middle-body flab. for sizing: i wear a size 4 in most clothes  and in this cami  i can wear a small/medium or a medium/large. the former pulls in more  but the later gives m"
-1,Maeve is one of my favorite retailer designers. usually fall in love with a blouse  only to look at the tag and discover it's by maeve (go figure).  this top is just atrocious though. does nothing for girls with a larger chest. very boxy and unflattering. gorgeous colors though  and the sleeve concept is cute. however  where the sleeve meets the shirt looks cheap and thrown on. not impressed.
-1,This skirt looks/lays exactly like the photo. i bought a size small and i usually wear a size 4. it was maybe a smidge big  but nothing that affected the look of the skirt. the material reminded me of felt/wool mixed together  almost like sunday school felt cut outs (but stiffer) (not a fan).. i was underwhelmed - it looked plain and simple  and the color washed me out. definitely not worth the price (for me anyways). good luck!
0,I really wanted to love this dress  but it just wasn't flattering on me. i have curves and i was hoping this would hug them in a joan on mad men way (sometimes these dresses that just hang on super thin models can look beautiful in a different way on a more voluptuous woman) but it was pretty shapeless on me. it also dips so low in the back that i would have to get a special bra to wear it. might be right for a more slender shape or someone who can go braless  but it didn't work for this short 
0,This jacket runs very large. i usually wear an xl but probably could fit into a medium. i have long arms  and the sleeves were way past my hands. i love the jacket  but it's just too sloppy.
1,Soft and cozy  not itchy at all  and it has pockets! i am 5'3  120lbs  34dd bra and take this in size small.
0,Dress looks awesome when your arms are down like the model. but don't you dare lift your arms. i'm kinda tall and the dress barely covers my bum when arms are raised. keeping the dress but will have to keep my arms down ;) maybe?
0,The fabric is nice and could pass for silk even though it is viscose-rayon. the pattern is pretty and flattering. sadly  the fit was just off- big in the center but tight at the hips. if i size up the v-neck might be too wide. i'm disappointed that i'll have to return it. it probably would look great on a different body type. i would recommend it for apple body types but not for pear body types.
1,I really wanted to like this dress on me  but it was not to be. the color is one of my favorites  but the dress accented all my problem areas. sadly  i returned it. i'm sure that someone with less substantial hips will look great in it.
0,I almost bought this skirt yesterday in store  but decided against it because the fabric was subpar. the skirt i tried on was snagged and unraveled. i selected another skirt  which i purchased. as the sales associate was folding the skirt  i noticed that this one was also snagged and unraveling. despite loving the style and fit  i had to be realistic with my lifestyle and decided to return it then and there. if there were two severe snags on two skirts before even leaving the store  how would th
-1,I had hopes for this shirt but was disappointed in the fabric...it's very stiff and heavy for a summer blouse. will be returning it.
0,I ordered this in blue  and loved the color. i'm not typically into the flowing top style  but i tried a few items on my last order  this being one. it's unseamed at the bottom  which was my primary reason for returning it - i couldn't see that in the photo online - but if that is your style  this item is good quality  soft  comfortable material  and a great spring or fall blue.
0,I was very disappointed to receive this and to note that the blouse has no ruffle down the front as pictured. there is no ruffle anywhere on the blouse. i am likely still going to keep it because i like the pattern  but the ruffle was what interested me for a cute work blouse and i want other shoppers to know that the blouse actually includes no ruffle when you order it.
1,"I saw this top online and loved it. i wasn't sure about sizing and because i don't live near a store i decided to order two sizes. i'm 5'8"" and typically wear an 8 or medium in tops. the 8 in this top though was much too tight in the shoulders. i sized up to a 10 and it fit beautifully!"
-1,What is going on with maeve sizing this season? in the past two months  i've purchased two maeve dresses that run very small--particularly at the waist.  having many maeve items from past seasons and other recent retailer purchases  it's impossible to ignore that maeve's sizing is quite off. that aside  the vibrant summer colors and material quality are great. the skirt is lined but billowy and fuller than ideal. strangely  it's a lot of dress yet not enough at the same time. there bodice h

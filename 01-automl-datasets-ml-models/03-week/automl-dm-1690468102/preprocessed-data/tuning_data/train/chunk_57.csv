-1,Oh dear. the elastic waistband just ruined this skirt for me--it made it look so cheap. i assumed from the photograph that the skirt was a knit over a structured lining with a real waistband with a zip. instead  it's a sweatshirt knit with no lining and elastic. it looked cheap and hung a bit baggy from the elastic waist  making it a no-go for me.
-1,"The chevron pattern on the mint/seaside version needs to be centered in the front to look right. mine was totally off so i returned it and had them overnight me a new one to my vacation address. unfortunately  the 2nd suit i received was also ""off center"". that one is going back too. would have loved this otherwise! a quality check on this is definitely needed.... beware."
0,"This dress looked so cute on the model  but unfortunately not so much on me. it appeared so much more fitted in the picture than it actually is. i ordered the xs and it is huge on me. definitely a tunic/swing style  rather than streamlined. my husband said it looked frumpy on me. it is also longer than it appears on the modei. for reference i am 5' 4""  i wish this would have worked  but i need something more fitted for my body type. if you are looking for an unfitted tunic style  this could be s"
1,I love this crushed velvet dress in the rich blue color . i plan to wear it with short peep toe boots and also with ankle leggings and flats. so glad velvet is in this year!
0,"I think these jeans are good for people with long lean legs. i'm 5'7"" 155 lbs and the wide cuff made my legs look short and stubby. the weight of the jeans is a little on the heavier side - i usually like soft denim. i usually wear a 31 and thought they were true to size."
0,The fit is quite strange on me as the tie is very high on the waist. this makes the jacket look odd and quite voluminous. i was very impressed with the fabric though but will have to return. i wish retailer would post what size is the model wearing. maybe she is wearing a larger size than usual which falls lower.
-1,I wanted to like this but it just didn't have much of a shape  not flattering at all. maybe if i was taller?
0,The body is huge  while the arms fit. being returned!
1,"I purchased this jacket in a pxs  as i am 5'2"" and 110lbs. the sleeve length is perfect! the fabric is soft and lightweight  which is perfect for living in southern california. i don't feel any itchiness either. the rest of the jacket fits me perfectly and hits right at the top of my hips.       there are two cute grommets on each side at the bottom by the hem  which add nicely to the look. i like how the sleeves are ribbed  giving it a comfy sweater feel. there's also two zippered pockets  whic"
-1,I agree with all of the reviews. the design and fit are wonderful if you can get it on.! the buttons are a nightmare! whoever made these clesrly sewed the loopholes on the buttons closed with no thought as how to open them or get them off. ridiculous! they need to put a side zipper on this as i will probably check into since i really want to keep it. so so so disappointing
-1,I agree with the other reviewers - the fabric is beautiful - although i wish they would start making blouses again that didn't require you to wear a cami underneath because of sheerness. i mean for the price shouldn't it be lined or something. when did our expectations on fabric quality get so low. but i knew going in that it would be sheer so i can't really complain too much. plus they are so loosely sewn on that after 20 minutes and only half the buttons undone one fell off. i gave up at that
1,I think the model photo doesn't do this dress justice. it's comfortable and perfect for a summery day. i wear it to work with a light grey cardigan  and of course it works well causally. i'm busty --d on a small frame -- but there's not gapping. the colors are pretty with blues and pinks without being childish.
-1,I am a size 2 and the skirt fit however it is so thick and voluminous  it looked like a pirate sack. it's unfortunately going back.
0,.unfortunately it hit at the widest part of my hips  so it wasn't very flattering. the point in the back was also kind of odd  and off center. i had to return. pretty color  though.
1,This dress is so cute! will you be bringing it back retailer?
1,Love this sweatshirt! will look great with gray pilcro jeans i bought recently. xs fits perfectly and i am usually a s or xs.
0,Nice quality and feel to the fabric but they are super lightweight and do not come down to the ankle. they fall at a strange place on the calf - a better cropped summer pant  perhaps.
0,I was so excited to get this! the fabric is beautiful - comfy soft and a great wash/print of blue. it reminded me of the ocean. however  the fit was off. the waist was too high  the length too short  and the straps to long. i was very disappointed. i considered taking it to the tailor before returning. ultimately  i decided to return.
-1,This dress is very cute and well made. unfortunately it was too short waisted for me and runs small in the bust. the arm holes were too big yet the bust small  very weird fit on me. i am six feet tall with 38c bust  maybe if you are shorter with smaller chest this dress will work for you. it has a thin lining and is not see through even though it is white fabric. i love the dress it just wasn't made for my tall figure.
-1,Gorgeous  but so big. i got eh pxs and it's like a mumu. i wiill return
1,"I tried these on in the store today and fell in love. they fit/drape beautifully and are incredibly comfortable while looking stylish. i'm 5'7"" and 128 lbs. and the 27 (a 4  i guess) fit perfectly. sadly  i can't afford them full price so will keep my eye on them in case they go on sale."
0,I'm 5'2 and 105 lbs; normally a size 25 petite for most jean brands but learned after receiving my online purchase that these jeans run large. i exchanged them for a size 24 petite and thought they fit okay at first but after testing them around the house  they kept stretching and i felt like they were going to fall off my waist! didn't want to wear a belt with these because it distracted from the relaxed style. sadly had to return my purchase.
0,This was so large on me that it looked awful. huge armholes and a baggy mess. material was nice and i loved the design. not sure a smaller size would even help.
1,Gorgeous dress. perfect for something special. paired with black heels. runs a touch large. i normally wear a small (5'6 and 140 pounds) but i'm expecting so i sized up to a medium and it's very roomy. the sleeves do cap out a little too much but it's just so pretty i don't care! def a keeper.
0,"I saw this in that postcard ""catalog"" and it drew my attention immediately  so when i saw it at the store  i knew i would try it on.  this dress is gorgeous - the lace is sturdy and won't easily be caught on things  the chambray is substantial but light. it's put together well and the slip covers greatly. the material isn't stretchy  but it keeps it shape and i like that. i'm 5'7"" and it hit me right at the knee  so it's a good length if you wanted to wear it with a cardigan to work as a spring"
1,I'm a 36ddd and although that's pretty large  i don't generally have trouble fitting into most retailer clothing. (the tracy reese amoret dress  for example  fits just fine in my regular size.) so  i ordered this dress in my regular size. well  i tried it on  and the right and left sides of the front closure on top were literally about 10 inches apart. there was *no way* this would fit  even if i went up 3 sizes. it's crazy! this is a terrible shame because it's really a lovely dress and it fits j
0,The collar on this sweater is too stiff for my taste. the color and fabric is really nice. just wish the collar was different.
-1,Contrary to the first review  there is a zipper so while it wasn't easy to get on  it did fit over my bust. i found this too small and high waisted  and i already have a high waist so i can imagine it looking empire waisted on a normal torso. what i hated was the ridiculous inverted pleat in the front of the dress which is almost impossible to see in the online photo. it made my already busty frame even wider and more unflattering. the lining was nice and soft and the sleeve length and hemline l
1,This dress is very lovely - ivory fits as pictured (slightly below knee) in ivory not as the black is depicted (much shorter). fits a little larger than expected and material is very stretchy.
1,This garment is beautiful because the fabric has great drape to it. i am probably between a small and xsmall  but ordered the xsmall. it is snug  but i have decided to keep it and can wear a cami underneath  just in case the buttons gap just a little. i am concerned that going up a size with leave the neck area too gaping. it is also a little snug in the elbow area.
1,"I love this top. very comfortable fabric and it can be worn in multiple ways. it is tight on the bottom. i usually wear an xs (5'4"" and 120 lbs). had to exchange for a small. very flattering. liked it so much i ordered it in both colors."
-1,I bought the bronze color which was nice but the cut just hung like a dust rag  no fit   no drape very unfinished looking. though i bought it on sale on sale  it is not worth keeping. over all it was not a worthwhile blouse to keep.
1,Crazy soft and comfy.  light weight so will be great for spring/ summer and layering.  so happy i bought it.
0,I wanted to love this shirt and thought i would based on the reviews. it runs really large however and while i love how flows it is i also looked pregnant. i am keeping though- looks nice layered under a jacket or sweater but alone i feel it looked sloppy and big....... which is sometimes just what you want so it is staying in my closet.
-1,I'm 5' 7 and bough a size 8 regular. this is so short that if you wear with jeans you can see a midriff. cute pattern  but i'm returning it.
-1,"Tried this dress in a small. i am 5'6""  135lbs  34c. the small was huge - the sash helped some  but looked like a potato sack on me. also  i noticed the fabric was piling slighly in the store. i had high hopes for this dress but left this one in the store."
1,Love this top! i tried it on in the store and instantly loved. i wore it and ordered it in another color. i bought my usual size but decided i'd like to have it slightly smaller for the next one  so i ordered down. it can go either way  it's quite flawy and roomy. cool for summer and supper flattering.
1,I laughed to myself  as i pulled these jeans on in the dressing room  expecting them to look ridiculous. instead  i was amazed at how well they fit  how cool they looked  and how comfortable they were (two sizes smaller than my usual).  yes  this 66 yo woman rocked these jeans!  i love the intricate whiskering  raw leg opening  and worn  dirty wash.  usually i do not like the dirty look  but this is good dirty. try them on:  you may just fall for them.
0,Everybody else is correct. the dress is adorable but the fit is weird. i am usually a size 2 (134lb  34 c) but got the 4 based on the reviews. the waist fits perfect  the top is huge  especially the armholes. if i get a size 2 then the waist will be too tight. however  the dress is so cute i am considering taking it for alterations and keeping it. definitely it has fit issues.
1,Great fit and extremely comfortable.
-1,"These were great pants that fit well  had good rise  perfect stretch for my curves  and i was really happy to get them on sale. (i'm 5'10""  165lbs  with a pear shape).     after only three months of occasional wear (about once a week  at most)  and following wash instructions perfectly  they started deteriorating. the pockets are becoming unsewn  the fabric has over-stretched in little sections that bunch  and the bottom hem is coming unraveled. these are the most low-quality horrible pants i've"
-1,This dress is so pretty  a true cinderella dress  that's why i can't find a reasonable explanation for such an amazing dress to be made out of plastic. i don't understand much about fabrics  but the dress feels like a waterproof camping tent. i bought a size 14  which is what i wear in moulinette souers (i usually go one size up since i find the rib cage small in this brand)  the fit was perfect and the cut was very flattering. i will anxiously hope for a remake of this dress with a better fabri
1,I'm 7months preggars and this top actually compliments my belly. extremely comfortable.
0,Got this in the mail today and while the design is cute  it's not as soft and comfortable as i would like. the front clasp takes a bit of practice to get on and off. the straps are a bit thin and hurts a bit.
0,"Just so i'm clear  the only reason i said it runs large is b/c of the top portion  but the bottom or waist. loved this romper when i saw it online  it was however too big in the top portion. the straps are adjustable but the back is too low for a bra and it ""gaps"" too much in the front unless you are standing straight all day.    also b/c i'm 5'8  the small was just a tad too short  definitely no bending !    i'm 5'8 tall  127lbs with an average size chest #34c# i ordered a small and the bottom"
-1,I got this shirt in a medium  my normal retailer size and while the short fit  the front is cropped! i am a fan of the tops that are shorter in the front and longer in the back  however this was just too short in the front. my belly button was exposed  and that wasn't the look displayed on the model. unfortunately this top is going back to the store.
0,The top was very nice and i liked the material. my problem was getting it on with the cami being attached to the top. it took me a while to figure it out. and for that reason alone i returned it.
1,I ordered this on a whim as i though  hey  i don't have off the shoulder tops let's try ti  looks cute...  i ordered the nude after debating  but glad i did  it is a bit warmer in color  and i need warm colors to complement my pale skin. teh nude almost has a slight pink hue to it (maybe i am seeing things). it is soft  not sure there is wool  i am not that sensitive to wool  felt soft to me.    size: i ordered the xxs as i think lately  retailer has been making things baggier  and on a shorter pe
1,Love the dress! feel it fits true to size or slightly larger...knocked off a star as my dress arrived without the slip liner. i luckily have a slip that works from another dress...the beading is a lovely surprise! subtle and just enough sparkle in the sun  but not too much.
-1,Yikes!  quite a smell off of this one- like wet/hot wool.  the color was beautiful  but the sweater is enormous!  strange fit under the arms as well.  this one went back the same day.
0,I just loved this when i saw it in store. beautiful fabric  lovely color. i ordered a small petite because petite xs was sold out. i imagine it might be a little better if it were a size smaller  but there is sooo much fabric in the pleated bottom  unless you are blessed with exceptionally long legs  it might end up looking like a witches coat. at least that is what i was told by my daughter.
1,The fit in the skirt is flexible because the waist is elastic and the shape is flattering  it doesn't stick out too far over the butt. the brocade texture and gold and blue colors are very fall. looking forward to wearing this with boots and tights. i'm usually either a large or medium in skirts and i went for a medium in this one.
0,This top fit me great across the bust - true to size there  however  it was very loose other than that (outside of the peplum of course). it did not seem flattering for my body shape/did not give me much shape on top. i was wider than i should be/am. this may work on some body types  but did not work for me. it was a nice feeling  comfortable top however.
1,This is a throw it on and you're cute.  so easy and comfy  requires barely any styling to look cute in this.  and it has pockets!
0,This suit itself is adorable. i usually have to get a size large for length but in this case the cups are way too big. it says light padding but there is no padding. just a giant empty cup. i'm going to order the size medium.
1,Just received my second pair of pilcro legging jeans; having bought them last year as well. great for work  girls night out  date night. so comfortable  with lots of stretch; fortunately they hold their shape and don't stretch out. they feel like pjs  but are nice enough for work. my pair from last year have held up well (color-wise)  however some of the leg seam stitching unraveled-- hence the reason for 4 stars in quality. hopefully  these will fare better.  regardless  i highly recommend!
0,I believe that this sweater is by moth and not knitted and knotted as noted in the description. for me  this tunic was just ok. i didn't think that the quality was great and it just didn't wow me  especially at this price point.
1,You make classy stuff. this skirt is a nice take on a tweed skirt.  colors: can't tell from the picture  but there is red and pink thread as part of the tweed  very fun and happy  yet appropriate colors for fall and winter. the cut is very flattering  the scallop part is interesting though  it is sown at one part of the skirt  in the middle  not sure why. i ordered the 0p  and that fit me like a glove. (26.5 in waist  35-36 in hips  115 lbs).    length on the petite was above the knee  like show
1,What can i say? this is a winner! it is stunning  gorgeous  a perfect summer dress that looks like sunshine and orange sorbet. it is classic  early 1960s look  which is exactly my style! i am usually a 14 or a 16  so i went with a 16 based on the reviews  and it fits divinely. i don't need another orange dress  but this is a keeper!
0,I'm not much for ponchos  but this one looked unique. it is thin  kind of a felt material - that was expected - but i was surprised to find it was shorter at waist than how it appears online   and it was wide horizontally. the colors were more muted and the design was slightly off center unlike pic. the turtleneck was thick and itchy. it was a return.
-1,So disappointed in the abundance of polyester fabrics that retailer carries these days. especially at this price point. the pattern and style of this dress is beautiful  but i will never spend two hundred dollars (or even half that) on a poly dress. please add more linen  cotton  and silk!
-1,I saw this dress online and really wanted to love it... unfortunately it wasn't at all as expected in person.  as the previous reviewer mentioned it is extremely itchy material  which was already pilling on many of the dresses displayed in the store. the neck was extremely tight; a problem i've never encountered with any retailer dress. additionally it seems to have a kangaroo pocket located right underneath the bust line  which protruded in an unflattering way. the pocket is not at all not
-1,I love tiny button down tops. this one didn't work at all for me. i was excited about the mix prints but on it looked like i was wearing a vest over a striped shirt. also the arm was frayed on the shirt i tried on.
-1,I thought this would look great with skirts  but all my skirts are too dressy for this t-shirt. that's really all it is -- a nothing-special t-shirt. and it runs so big! i'm usually a large or xl in tops  but for this one i bought a medium  and it's still too big. i think a small would have been fine. but  as i mentioned  it doesn't go with any of my skirts  so it's not worth looking for a small.
0,"40% sweaters...i couldn't pass it up. unfortunately  when i raise my arms  my tummy shows (i'm 5'6"")  so i had to return it."
0,About a month ago i purchased the pilcro hypen chinos in moss size 28 petite. i loved the color and fit so much that when i saw free shipping being offered i decided to get another pair. this time i ordered the color ?pink? and of course size 28 petite. well the color really isn?t pink and unlike the moss color it does not look the color online. the color is more like salmon or apricot definitely not pink. what bothered me more is the fit. this pair was too big. it?s mind-boggling why the sizing
-1,"I got this dress and the material was super fuzzy and itchy. the prior reviews stated it was ""warm and cozy"" and not itchy at all  but i found it to be uncomfortably so. the dress was true to size for me and the length was good. i loved the plaid in the material just wished the material had been more soft and not rough. the material reminded me of mohair."
0,I saw this online and loved it. plus after reading the reviews i thought why not. but if you have a big chest beware. i am a 34ddd and a pretty solid medium. the volumous front of the vest added way to much to me and i sized down to a small. had to return.
-1,I ordered a small and it is enormous; i usually wear a size 10. it is short but the fullness in the body and the sleeves made me look like a sumo wrestler. also  it is a very heavy knit which would be great for up north but too bulky for atlanta unless the temps are in the 40s. i'm sending it back.
-1,I loved the dress  but just not dressy enough after rethinking what i needed. very easy order and return. thanks!
1,I just received this coat and love it. the only downside is that online the color looks like a royal blue (which i wanted) but in truth the coat is a basic navy. this was not a deal breaker for me. i love the details. it is not lined as someone mentioned earlier but it's not meant to be a heavy winter coat. i can't wait to wear it with jeans  boots and a striped or plaid tunic.

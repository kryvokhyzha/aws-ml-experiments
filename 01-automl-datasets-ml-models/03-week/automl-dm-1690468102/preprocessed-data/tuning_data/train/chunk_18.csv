-1,"I loved the print and fabric of this dress when i first saw it  but trying it on was a very different story! the photo seems to show a wider  more well-defined waist  with just a small amount of ""blousing"" on top  but this was not the case. yes  the waist fit  but it is a narrow band that was covered completely by the hanging over of the ill-fitting top  turning the entire look into a shapeless and very unattractive fit. sadly  this is going right back!"
0,I'm not sure i recommend this shirt but i did purchase the plum yesterday. i'm always always a m and had to size down to an xs on this one. that's how large it was! even the xs had plenty of room; i'm 5'6 145 lbs 36b for reference. the material look like it will stretch out even further but i got it anyway. it was on sale plus 25% off and for that price i can use it for casual days on the weekends. it's comfortable on and loved the lace detail.
1,Overall this is a great shirt. the material is soft and a little sheer  but not sheer enough to have to wear something underneath. the only negative is that the v sits a little high so i felt like i was constantly pulling the shirt down through out the day.
1,Love this top. work appropriate and dress down worthy. i also like the fact that it is not clingy around the waist. comfortable fabric.
1,Love to just throw on this shirt with whatever accessories and skinny jeans. easy to wear and very comfortable
0,I wanted to love this top- the pink color is wonderful and vibrant. however  like many tops lately  it is short waisted and ended up looking a bit boxy. i am 5'8 and found it about 1-2 inches too short.
1,I really like this sweater. i would suggest ordering a size up. i could had worn my normal size but a size up was much more comfortable. i have a burnt orange skirt that i wear with this and it makes the flowers pop.
0,"I really wanted to like this dress. i am 5'3"" 125 lbs and this dress was about 4 inches too long. the hem created a puddle around my feet. i've bought other maxis from retailer without this problem. sadly it went back to the store."
0,This top has gorgeous embroidery  very very nice  looks good in both wine and grey. it runs large. i kept it around not sure whether i should keep it. i usually wear xl  i ordered l and it still was loose at the bottom but fitted at the top. i have a big bust  and the embroidery ended at the top of my bust making the entire look unflattering  because the bust juts out in a strange way below the embroidery. the arms also tend to look wider due to the style. i don't like the fit at all.
1,Super cute and comfy  perfect for fall and winter (apre ski!). great with skinny jeans or leggings and ankle boots.
-1,I wanted to love this dress  it looks beautiful on the model but it isn't the flattering  even on sale i am not sure if it would be worth it  it it runs pretty big.
-1,So i'm not sure if its just my body type or what  but this did nothing for me. the bottom  which i thought would be too big was actually too small in both the small and the medium (i'm a size 8 bottom) and then when i sized up to the medium it was still too tight and then the top was loose. i just think this one is going to take the right body type. it could look really beautiful on the right person  just not me.
1,This dress is amazing. nice material  comfortable and really flattering. slightly tight in the arms but otherwise perfect. highly recommended!!!
-1,I couldn't wait to try this on this sweater.  sadly  it was too large in all ways.  the sleeves are adorable  but the ruffle overwhelmed my arms. this was much longer on me than the model.  it stopped mid-thigh.  the quality seemed fine  but it is a thin sweater.
1,I had been on a white jeans hunt for some time. pilcro is one of my favorite brands  and i can buy online with confidence knowing they will fit. if petite had been available  that would have been better in length  but it was not so i had them hemmed.
-1,"I ordered this in the ""plum"" color  which in real life just looks like a very  very dark brown. that would probably be okay  but the dress is actually about 3 inches shorter than the listed measurements. i ordered the regular length  but the shortest part of the hem hits me only about halfway down my thigh...way  way too short. i am 5'5""  for reference. lastly  i think the fabric is just awful quality  especially for this price point. the slight texture makes it want to cling to itself - worn ou"
0,The pattern and fabric on this dress are very nice. there is just too much fabric. it's much too baggy but could make a nice maternity dress. i'll be returning it.
-1,I got this in a l  and probably i am a m. however  the waist pretty much fit  but the bodice was baggy in a really bizarre way. i don't think a human could actually be shaped a way that would fit properly in this dress. this dress is well suited for a woman with a very large bust  but a small waist.
1,I just received this jacket in the cream color. it is so cute! you can change it from 3/4 to full length sleeves. i ordered both an xs and s and kept the s after i saw that i could cinch the waist to fit better. in the picture it looks a bit boxier than it really is possibly because not cinched. the material is good quality and the jacket is complete with attention to detail from the buttons to the jean contrast pull on the zipper. i love this jacket! it is a good cross over from athletic to cas
1,This dress is perfect for any occasion  it looks great with every shoe and is flattering on.
1,This cardigan is utterly gorgeous. way prettier on than i feared. my only issue is it felt a little itchy in the arms  and so i finally looked closely at the tag. the tag says the *back* section (which looks exactly like the weave on the arms) has a measly 5% wool snuck into the fabric content. why  retailer? why wool? i am so sensitive to it! my eyes have been demon red and itchy all day  classic symptoms that led to my getting rid of anything in my wardrobe with wool in it.  now i have a problem
0,Simple cotton garment such that the price seems high. if it had fit perfectly there is a chance i would have kept the dress  but my normal size 6 was a bit large and even though it was size petite  also to long in the upper body. perhaps a 4 p would have fit  but it may have then been too small. puzzling for petite to be too long in upper body. love this shape dress and the color and pattern however.
-1,Fabric much heavier than looks in picture. also nothing mentioned in the description. great color and fit but i live in florida.
0,I purchased this for a very good price and i typically love maeve... should have been a win-win. the fabric is thin and slinky in the most unfortunate way. it made finding appropriate undergarments very difficult. i had to add a slip (that helped) and figured that since i'm losing weight  it would look better when i'm down a few more pounds. that being said  i didn't find it to be figure flattering. i have a tummy and there was at least one photo from the bridal shower i wore this to  where i lo
1,Perfect fit and i've gotten so many compliments. i buy all my suits from here now!
-1,As others have said  this is cropped  so will look funny with most pants that aren't high waisted. i'm going to try it with a few dresses before i return it. the lining is adorable  so i don't want to have to send it back.
-1,Really wanted to love...but...the way it fit..lower part a tad too flowy...almost maternity like to hide a belly and the top area feels like my chest is being smushed! despite my bra size being a modest 36b...the look it gave was square on top almost block like with bottom that had flare...such a pretty top unfortunately the overall design just didn't work me.
0,I so wanted to love this dress  but the bell sleeves were enormous! if you're standing completely still with your arms down they look cool  but if you move your arms at all it looks like you have wings. the rest of the dress was beautiful  though  and a flattering swingy shape even on an hourglass/pear shaped figure. i would recommend sizing down  as the dress runs large.
1,One of the best maxi dresses i have ever found! i needed a dress that could accommodate a large bust (36g) and camouflage my postpartum belly. the dress did it all. i ordered the large (5'7 and 155 lbs) and it is so flattering. it has just the right amount of coverage up top to prevent looking too busty. and the band around the midsection makes me look much slimmer. like i said  best maxi dress ever. price is pretty high  but it was worth it!
0,This top was quite voluminous when i purchased it and i sized down to an xs  however after hand washing it once in cold water it has shrunk significantly. it still fits  but something to be aware of.
1,I tried on almost every dress in the shop today  and this is the dress. as soon as i tried it on i started twirling around. i felt beautiful and i couldn't stop smiling. my mother said that it makes my blue eyes glow. it flatters my figure by hanging perfectly across my bust-line  floating over my curves  and camouflaging my little unappealing bumps. also  the dress is cut nicely under the arms which allows coverage for a strapless bra. i chose the medium size even though i usually wear a large
1,I loved the layered look without all the bulk. the different textures make it so interesting.
0,I found the fit of this dress to be true to size with a flattering bust and waistline; however  the fabric feels cheap and doesn't drape as nicely as i'd hope for the price. this would be a lovely dress in a better quality fabric. for sizing reference  i'm 5'5''  122 lbs  30dd  and took my usual size xs - though i'm busty for my size  the top provides nice coverage.
-1,I wanted to love this shirt. the fit was a little off and i wish it had come in a little at the waist to be more figure flattering before it flared out. the fabric is nice but wrinkles easily and in the white is see through.. sadly i will be returning.
-1,"This jumpsuit looked so great on the model  and looked so hideous on me. i'm 5'4"" and in great shape  and this jumpsuit looked absolutely ridiculous....not to mention it rode right up my backside in the worst possible way. i'm so disappointed!"
1,This is a classic! not only is it reminiscent of a fun 60's swing dress but the perforated outer layer over a solid shift creates this modern edge to a reto style!!! love it!
1,I just bought these in store. so great looking. however  i bought the petites and they are still incredibly long. like 6 inches too long. so  i'll hem them  though based on the review that mentions shrinking  i might wash them first to see what happens. great for summer in the city.
0,"I like this shirt  as in general i prefer more form-fitting and less flowy shirts. however  after washing the shirt and hanging dry it has shrunk to be too short to wear with even mid-rise jeans. so: good if you don't like long t-shirts  bad if you are tall  like me (5'8"") and don't want to wear a crop top."
-1,Man  this dress is the worst. i don't understand how it looks the way it does on the model. agree with previous reviewer - there must be a minimum of 200 pins pulling the waves and waves of extra fabric back. this dress looks so cute   but is so  so  so disappointing in person. sweater collar and cuffs - stiff and bulky. dress - billowy and sack-like - not sure how they got a belt to pull it all in. save yourself the return and do not get sucked in by the sale price and extra sale discount like
-1,I'm not really sure what the designer was trying to accomplish with this dress. the fabrics and details are pretty but the shape is really strange. for one thing  the dress has a very straight cut so there is not a lot of room for movement and the thin belt makes the shape even worse. i felt like i was wearing a really fancy garbage bag. also  the way the bottom flares out is just strange considering the cut and length. i really wanted to like this dress but unfortunately it was a complete miss
0,This shirt is beautiful and so soft. it would have made a wonderful long-sleeved tee except for the fact that it was so low cut. the only way this is wearable is with a tank underneath which  for me  defeats the purpose of this type of shirt. i am rather busty (34 dd)  so maybe if you are smaller on top you might could pull it off.
1,This jacket is well-made and smart looking. it gave me just the boost i needed today at a difficult meeting. thank you retailer!
-1,I bought these in the mustard color and the salmon color.  i didn't have a problem with general fading  but used natural  mild stain remover (biokleen) and the pants were ruined. one faded where i sprayed and the other has a permanent water mark.  cold wash and line dried. such a bummer that these pants aren't every day wearable and washable!
1,Great sweater. cozy and thick. the bands at the waist and wrists help keep this sweater in place. the loopy knitted fabric adds a bit of texture to the gray which makes it a little more exciting than your average gray sweater. i got a small and it fit perfectly.
0,As another reviewer mentioned the quality isn't here.  they pilled in the thighs after wearing once and stretched out so much at the end of the day i was pulling them up constantly.  such a bummer because i love this brand.
1,I bought this in blue and have worn it with jeans  khaki shorts  and camo pedal pushers. added just a perfect amount of feminine detail without being over the top. i'm loving that it shows off my shoulders (they're tan from my vacation and i've been working like a fiend on my arms in the gym). it's well made too!
-1,Whatever happened to sizing! pretty print and color but has enough fabric for 2 tops. it is also unlined which is not a huge issue. i wore it with a cami. the arms weren't too gaping for me  thankfully. i tried to make it work with a wide belt but i will have to get it tucked on the sides. i am 140 lbs and got the small. should have gone 1 or even 2 sizes smaller.
0,I only gave this three stars due more to personal preference than to any real flaws with the product. it is very comfortable and for a jersey-style shirt quite warm. but that is one of my issues with the shirt. i wanted to wear it well into spring and i think it'll be just too warm. (i live in the northeast) i also felt that while it fit tts it had a more generous fit than what i expected  which was another negative for me. i wanted it to be more fitted to my body. however  i did keep it because
-1,It's way more distressed than it looks in the picture and that was a no for me.
0,This sweater has a fun big bold flower and a nice blue color and is quite roomy. the fit is larger around the arms and chest  which might work well for people who are very curvy on top. it seems to taper a bit to the waist. the roomy fit to the arms gives it almost a bat wing shape. it was too overwhelming on my petite frame  what with the bold flower and the fit  so i passed. but if you like the big flower and color and want a roomy sweater  this could work well for you.
-1,I purchased this shirt in white and black. the white is more ivory-isn  and is a bit thin/see through. the shirts can be worn with jeans  or dressed up with a skirt. i just wish it was a little more form fitting. i do like the hint of stretch in the fabric! very comfortable as well!
0,This top has a lot of potential (comfortable  easy to wear) but it's cut too small in the area above the bust. i tried the top in small  medium and large (i usually wear s or m in retailer tops) and couldn't get that area to not look tight or like it was pulling. you can see it on the model  too -- that space right above the bra near the armhole. i think you'd need to order a size up to get that space to work but then the top will start to look too big on the bottom.   i tried the green in the sto
-1,If you like to wear lampshades this is the shirt for you. beyond unflattering. boxy and seriously looks like lace was stitched to the bottom of a lampshade
1,I couldn't believe the bargain price of these leggings  so i took a chance and ordered all 3 colors. when they arrived  i was equally pleased to see how soft  cozy and warm they were and how nice they looked with all my oversized tops. also interesting is that the textures of all 3 are different. the black has a vertical lined texture  the lavender has a cable weave texture and the gray is untextured. wearing them is going to be a pleasure!
0,I purchased this top in white and lavender. the white is very nice  soft and semi-sheer but not completely see-thru (fine with a nude bra). it is a swingy fit and slightly longer in back than front  but i expected that. i purchased a medium and it's plenty roomy. i am usually between a medium and large in retailer tops so i would consider it tts for a very relaxed fit.   the lavender fits slightly looser and the hem is really uneven. it looks in some of the photos like this might be intentional  b
0,This top is really beautiful. the color is rich and the texture on the back is a unique touch. and i think it might have worked for me except that i could only find a m/l and it was just too big. i love drapey styles and think this top would have been just the right amount of drapey if i'd been able to snag a smaller size. but the m/l looked like a teal sack  so it's going back.
0,I totally agree with the first review. i thought this was soooo cute on the model  but it's loose fitting and has no shape to it.
0,I am somewhere between a 24 and a 25 (i have narrow hips but an average waist)  so i was happy to find that these worked for me in me in a 0. i loved the blue color as an interesting neutral. they did stretch out a little with wear  but i still felt like i looked good by the end of the day. i typically really like cotton/linen blends as i can usually wear them out of the dryer if i'm going for a casual look - a few wrinkles with linen doesn't bother me. but these. oh my. when i pulled them out o
-1,This dress runs so large  why did they not make an extra small. the material and detail are great the flow in the back is different but is flattering. i wish wish that they made this in the extra small  i was swimming in it  there was no way to fix it so it went back
-1,It was very pretty but it ran very big   sadly i had to return it.
0,I feel the same way about this shirt as i do about the sungarden tee. it's a lovely pattern and i like the fit (it's not clingy)  but it's a bit see-though. it's not as bad as the other tee  but no contrasting or patterned bras can be worn with this shirt (unless that's your thing). that said  i'm happy with it because it's a soft and pretty shirt that will get a lot of wear in warm weather. i am very glad i got it on sale though. i wouldn't have paid full price for it.
-1,I love maeve but this shirt's quality was poor and it was not worth the price. i would not recommend buying this online. you really need to try the blouse on in the store to make the decision as to if its worth purchasing or not...... and in my case this is being sent back.
0,I was really excited to receive this caftan  but it looked very strange on my body. i have small shoulders and the xs was still very big on me. there's also a seam along the sides that made me look boxy. the quality is really great  but i thought that the color seemed a tad bit darker/muted than pictured.
-1,Beautiful color  design and fit.  but i couldn't wait to get it off.  i don't have sensitive skin and don't recall ever putting a jacket on that felt like steel wool.
1,I am usually a small sometimes medium. purchased a small and want to wear it off the shoulder but it is too tight and the fabric is scratchy. it is a crepe fabric and although beautiful the hand of the material is not for me.  confused if i should return or get a medium as the look is very cool.  i wish this had been linen or some more natural material but still recommend it as a good buy
-1,This dress is so short! i double checked to make sure i didn't get a petite by mistake.  i'm 5'10 and ordered an extra small because of the deep v neck. it fit well on top  but  you could see my underwear in the front. seriously  i dont even think miley cirus would wear it that short. the lace was really beautiful so i was disappointed that it didn't work out.
1,I actually ended up buying two of these dresses. i took the first one to the dry cleaner and they chewed up the slip and put a hole in the dress. i was so sad that i went and bought a second one before they could sell out. the good news is that it was on sale! this is an awesome light and airy dress that is great for those hot summer days. i pretty much wear it every opportunity i get. for reference i purchased the small. it's loose but the shoulders  armholes and slip all fit perfectly. i weigh
-1,This top was originally way overpriced. so i ordered it on sale for half price. still overpriced. it arrived yesterday and frankly i am disappointed. the quality is not great. it is like a jersey type material. doesn't look like the photograph at all. i like the color  but frankly  that's about it.
0,I love this top and the beading is beautiful  but just like everyone else  it was way too large. i normally wear a lg  but the large looks and feels like a 3xl. beautiful but large
1,The fabric is lovely and the straight leg cut makes these pants a great option for summer. they do run small.
0,"I am 5' 10"" 135 lbs  normally a size 4l and ordered both a small in the navy and a medium in the beige. the elastic waist on both is not a tight/ muffin-top producing elastic like on some thinner banded leggings. in fact  the elastic is very loose  not very stretchy on either of the sizes. i think the s had been previously tried on  given the state of the packaging and the fact that the seat of the pant was already a bit stretched out. the m is definitely too large so i would say that these run"

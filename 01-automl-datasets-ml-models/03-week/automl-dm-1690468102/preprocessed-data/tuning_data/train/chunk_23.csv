-1,"Beautiful floral print and while i like the concept of this dress it was a total failure for me. where the knit meets the print hit me at the top of my bust  truly a disastrous look for a bustier figure since the fabric just drapes down and made me look much larger than i actually am. same with the arms  if the white knit had carried down to the elbow it would have elongated the arms instead of cutting them off mid biceps to make them look like giant hams. i'm 5'6"" and a classic size 8 and this"
0,I love these pants. like  obsessively love  like didn't want to take them off to wash them  love. annnnd i wish i hadn't because they came out of a delicate cycle cold water wash with a huge part of the leg seam ripped apart like a spider web. maybe i just got a bad pair  but i wasn't prepared to have to patch them after one wash for the price.
-1,This looked like a simple  chic blouse  but the fabric felt cheap to me  like thin lining fabric. the neckline is too deep and wide as well and so not flattering.
1,Cute top  a little less fitted than i was expecting.
0,I had been eyeing this top for weeks. it's look so beautiful on the model  however  not great on me. material is fab. the tee is way shorter than it appears online and there is too much flutter material.
0,Yes  it's a swing top  just like many of the other swing tops retailer is offering this season. i find this silhouette unflattering on me  being top heavy  so i was frustrated to discover the swing-ness only after i ordered it and it arrived at my house. it also runs huge  with big gaping arm holes. the sleeves are cute and fluttered. the black panels on the sides are semi-sheer. it is a pretty boxy top  which the photo doesn't seem to capture. order at least a size smaller than usual.
1,For once i found a peasant top that wasn't a balloon. i'm 5'1 and curvier on top and the small fit great. the blouse billowed a bit but it didn't make me look like a hot air balloon. the pattern of the blouse  a mix of various floral swatches  is very pretty. the blouse will look great with black skinny jeans and boots for fall. i can't wait to wear it!
1,"This cardigan can be dressed up with leggings and booties or dressed down with jeans and chucks. i love the fit of the small (5''3"" and small/medium build). would highly recommend for a dinner out or lounging around at home."
1,I love wearing this. it is a little slice of summer  which i am desperately hanging on to. the color pops  it's so very comfortable  & the back is a work of art! can be dressed up with a pencil summer skirt  or down with capri style pants.
-1,So this may be my least favorite thing i have ever bought from retailer. this top had so much extra material it was like wearing a bag or parachute. it looked a million times cuter in the photos.
-1,I ordered this top online during the mother's day sale  thinking i had found the perfect white staple tank i wanted for summer. i had this top on for barely five seconds before i knew it was going straight back. the quality of the fabric and the overall design are both very good. but the problem is that the top comes with an under-layer up top. this is normally a good thing; extra coverage in a sumer top generally means you ca go braless. the problem is that the top layer of the shirt is so shee
0,"I'm usually a petite  but bought in regular xs. perhaps a petite would have worked better  but this was way too low cut in front and back. i did not like the way it hung on me at all. i'm 5;2"" and 105 lbs  but regular xs normally fits better than this did. i could barely keep the shoulders from slipping off. sorry  it's a return for me."
-1,I should have listened to the reviews that said this top was too boxy  but i didn't believe them and bought it anyway. i was wrong! this top is so boxy and wide  just awful.
0,I agree with the other reviewer that the color of this top is more burgundy with purple undertones rather than a deep red like shown online. the fit was very boxy on me and it did not look flattering. i was not willing to to have it altered so i returned it.
0,"I loved the rich navy blue color with the accent pockets. the fabric was a nice weight  not too thin like lots of retailer tops. i liked the top from the front  however the back was way too long  especially with the looseness of the style. it would have been much better if it were not so much longer in the back and maybe a little more fitted. it might work on someone taller. i'm 5'3"" and 120 lbs. and i tried xs."
-1,I ordered my usual size m and when arrived i thought the material and cut was nice.  once i tried it on it was way too big in hips.  i looked rather comical how it extended on the sides.  i returned the dress.
1,Love the colors! love the stripes! great shape! great style! but...i am normally a 12 on top...and this pulled across my back...so i have it in for an exchange for a 14. sometimes i have to do that...i have a broad back. we will see how it fits! but what an adorable shirt!
0,Cute dress to throw on and go. fits pretty true to size except for the slip underneath. it's a little tight and i felt to short for the dress. i ended up wearing a full slip i had under it and that work great!
0,I was really excited to receive this dress. it's a fun concept and different from anything else i have. however  the dress was way too short on me. i'm 5 ft 6 in.  and the size medium was way too short. given the thin nature of the material  i did not feel comfortable keeping the dress  even for wearing it outside the office. i will have to return this dress.
0,"I love the style and the look of this sweater. i wanted to love it and keep it but could not because the itchiness was too much. the style looks so comfortable and easy going  but it was not  it was clingy around the waist and backside. for reference  i am 5ft 4in and 128b and i ordered the small - the sleeves were too long on me  not ""cool"" long like some other sweaters this season."
-1,This should have been cute  but the fabric choice + ruching design made me look like i had elephant skin rippling around my waist -- super unflattering.
-1,When i saw this top online  i thought i'd love it and immediately ordered it in both colors.  they arrived today and i am soooo disappointed.  i have never seen such drab colors.  the blue is a muddy grayish hue (like an overcast day) and the pink is a dusty shade of peach.  yuck.  and i was hoping the ruffle at the bottom would have a chiffon-like flowy effect.  instead  the ruffle is made of a cheap looking knit.  back these go...
0,Nice lines  just a bit tight if you have larger / more muscley shoulders.
-1,I looked at this dress for a long time before i purchased it because of the money. i wear a size 2p. was entirely disappointed in the style and construction of this dress. for one thing the lining is bulky and you could never wear it in warmer weather without burning up. the dress as pictured looks very feminine and light weight silk but there is just too much material going on--- thick and heavy. the overall fit was too big and very unflattering.
1,The blouse is lightweight and is double layered  meaning a light layer over a lower layer. it's not bulky and not super flowy...just enough. i'm 5'1  a bit busty  and generally wear a m in retailer and this blouse fit great. it's figure flattering and not boxy. may be a tad short for taller women.
-1,This product has a terrible zipper that ultimately caused me to return the dress. it's pretty bad when it won't even zip up on the hanger. such a beautiful dress; it broke my heart!
-1,I had high hopes for this dress but my husband said i looked pregnant and that i was wearing a tablecloth- and he was right! i'm usually a size 10 so perhaps this would look good on a talk lanky person with a very long torso... but probably not. way too much fabric around the midsection. it's a shame because the fabric was really pretty  but too stiff a hand to drape well.
0,"I bought this for an upcoming conference and was grateful that it shipped very promptly.  it runs quite large  in my opinion. i'm 5'7"" and about 130-135lbs. the small was huge on me in the chest and shoulders/arms. the stomach also wasn't very fitted. the material is thinner than i expected (you can see through the dress to some extent when you hold it up to the light)  but i don't think this is a problem  necessarily. had it been thicker  it probably would be too warm. but you might need a slip"
-1,The length in the front is too short and the bottom flares a lot which is really unflattering. i love the top half of the shirt but the bottom half should be more form fitting.
0,"Based on other reviews that this top ran large  i ordered this online in two sizes. both seemed to fit alright in my chest (although the chest fit tighter in the smaller size)  and both were much too big on the bottom. the front bottom of this shirt has a series of pleats  so the bottom of this top really  really  really flared out away from my hips. the length seemed fine on me (5'10""). the material is very thin  and i could see my nude bra through the white pattern."
0,I loved the color of these but they bagged out with just one wear. they are going back to store.
0,This top looks good on model and has great reviews online. however it did not work on my bodytype. when i tried it the slit in the front sat too low. i don't like showing cleavage because i dress conservatively. other than that i would have loved wearing it. arm cut is not too big such it shows sides of bra bands. overall fit is loose and drapery.
1,I am 5'5  150lb  generally size medium shirt  size 6 or 8 pants and bought a size 8. i have had two c-sections so my stomach has some problem areas  which can be easily highlighted in a swimsuit- not this one! i felt good  it hid my problem spots  showed off curves and stays in place! i can't speak to the durability of it yet  however  it makes me feel great  and that is tough when i am in a bathing suit. that in itself makes it worth the price! try it!
-1,Again  bought this while wearing my retailer colored glasses. i loved the flowiness and color of the dark pink  and was convinced in the dressing room that this top made me look like a chic goddess  mid-vacation on the amalfi coast. i tried it on at home  and it straight up looked like i was wearing a maternity top. since i'm not with child  this one's going back!
-1,The shirt is cute  but there is no way that the length posted on the website is correct--it's a crop top. this was returned.
-1,Gals  if you absolutely must have this top wait for it to go on sale (don't worry  it will). between the poor fit and the polyester  i have no good things to report about it. this is very much below retailer's usual quality and style.
1,"This is a nice sweater. very soft and while cardigans are not normally flattering on me  i found this one to be slimming. for reference i am 170 lbs 5'8"" and a size medium or 10."
0,Loved the style and color/design but this dress was simply too short in the front. the slip was also slightly tight over hips. i wish this was longer!
1,I saw this and had to have it!  it is so beautiful.  it has pops of color that can be paired with so many options.  i like the uniqueness of the flowers being on the backside.  it is thinner fabric  so i will have to wear a black cami underneath but i have no problem with that.  especially  going into cooler weather anyway.  it is very flattering on.  this one will go fast.  thank you retailer!
1,The material is very soft and the lace has a beautiful design. it looks very elegant and romantic. you will need a racer back bra to wear with it though  because of the design of the straps. it is very flowing and i think the cut is flattering. the material in the back is slightly transparent so you might want to wear a tank underneath. overall  very pretty and i would highly recommend. (i purchased the white and yellow version.)
0,Wore this romper 1x and after washing  the hem on one of the shorts/legs completely unraveled. if i want to ever wear it again  i will have to bring it to a tailor to get fixed. unacceptable for a $200 product. cute design and good fit but questionable quality.
0,"I'll start with what i loved  this dress is made with a really beautiful  quality material. the material is gorgeous in person and the dress is lined which is really nice. however the fit is just so very strange. i am 5'6"" and curvy. i tried both a medium and a small (for reference i usually take a medium or large/ size 8 or 10) the medium was so large and too roomy around the arms and chest (i'm 34 d) the small was too tight. the v neck lay in a very strange way and i'm not sure it would have b"
-1,I ordered this sweater in the pink color in a small and xsmall  in order to see which was the best fit. i was really looking forward to getting it because it looked so great online - like it had a nice flow  the cute zipper and was a good match for a pink and grey skirt that i have. i was really disappointed  the sweater doesn't flow like it does in the picture - it kind of billows out in the front and back and isn't flattering. i have a small build  and  frankly  i usually look good in sweaters
-1,I initially liked the feel and quality of the top but once it was on it was much shorter and looser than the picture of the model. it flowed out from my chest with one central pleat in the front and my husband said it made me look pregnant. then came the tedious task of taking it off with such a snug fit in the shoulders. i'm regularly a size 2/xs  32d and 120 lbs and both size 2 and 4 did not work for me.
1,The material is great!! got them in both colors and went with a tall size for one. everyone compliments them!
0,Very cute and would transition well season to season with different boots/booties.  didn't lay well on chest for me.  returned it.
-1,"I absolutely loved the patterns and colors of this skirt  if only the cut wasn't so odd. the sides of the skirt ""wing out"" for a very distracting and unflattering look. the stiff  felt-like quality of the material only makes matters worse. in that respect  the model photos are not at all accurate. it also runs large. i had to go down one full size."
1,I really love this sweater. i normally wear an 8 and bought a 12. even it is a little snug. but it really is very cute! can't wait to wear it with black leggings and boots.
1,"I have a short torso and short arms  so i purchased this in a petite medium. i probably could've worn the ps  but i do like the little extra room. it is a classic shirt dress with just enough of today's trendy ""frayed edge"" to make it contemporary. the fabric is super soft and lays nicely. i can imagine wearing this through the seasons with a variety of shoes/legwear & accessories! looking forward to it."
0,I took a chance on this top because i liked the style. i prefer natural fibers like cotton and linen. this is rayon and spandex. sure  why not at least give it a shot and go outside my box?! if the fabric would have been my preference  it would have been a keeper. i did not like the feel  nor the semi-sheer quality. maybe it would work for you  but not for me. back it went.
0,I read the reviews and everyone loved them so ordered them online. for me  they are a no. i thought the fabric was cheap and the quality not so great compared to typical retailer items.
1,"Although this is not my husband''s favorite (he prefers things a little more tailored). i absolutely adore this! i got this in the ivory/cream color not realizing they had it in two more colors. i just ordered the blue. i loved the way the size small fit (not as wide)  but the medium for my height (5'7"") fit better and was longer. if i want to wear it as a dress  i could. i highly recommend this!! well made and looks great!!!"
1,I always chuckle when i see this dress because it looks so busy and so crazy with all the mixed prints  i think it's a lot of fun. not so fun to put on  but it's worth the trouble. i swear my shoulders are sore after manipulating this on myself. i also own the mona dress in 8p  but i had to size down to a 6 for the melodist because the hips were not fitted enough and the back bloused out too much.
0,Just a warning  the yoke on this dress has sequins underneath. i'm not a sparkle kinda gal  so as soon as i saw that  the dress went right back in the package and will be going back to the store. i wish that had been described or more evident in the pictures  to me  it cheapens the whole dress  which would otherwise be adorable.
1,I was attracted to this sweater because of it's unique style. i really love it. it looks just like the picture. it is of good quality  as is the leather belt. it is the perfect fall sweater and i love that it's different. i highly recommend this sweater.
-1,"This may be the ugliest dress with the worst fit i have ever tried. the blue stripes are brighter than they appear in the photo  absolutely garish. the top is baggy with awful beads on the back ties  it just looks cheap. the skirt is an antebellum nightmare.    i did not even want to try it on  it's that bad. i considered adding a photo  but was too horrified.  for reference  i'm 5'10""  approximately the height/ size of the model  but it was shorter than the photo depictes. i wanted to like it "
-1,I ordered the ivory of this dress  expecting it to be a nice dress i could wear into my second trimester of pregnancy. instead  i received a dress that looks like a ugly  vintage-gone-wrong curtain of fabric. the 'ivory' is the color of yellowed newspapers. the fabric was cheap and had thread pieces sticking up all over the place. i would've been better off sewing myself a dress out of drapes a la gone with the wind or sound of music. the fit isn't that great  either. big and boxy. it could acco
-1,Loved the look of this shirt online. i tried it on and was sad to see that the frontal view is all wrong. the cool shoulder design is almost too exaggerated (almost looks as if i'm ready for take off!). unfortunately  none of the featured photos on the product page display the frontal view of the model. i really wish the shoulder design was slightly smaller in shape and size - i would have loved it! looks great from the side but sadly i can't walk around like that ;)
1,Absolutely love this top! i've been on the lookout for a cute cotton top  something that'd be ideal for summertime. this beautiful piece doesn't disappoint. the color pairing - white cotton base and lovely red thread embroidery - looks stunning. not the mention the unique back detailing makes it a must-have. highly recommend.
1,What more could you want than a dress that slips on easily  hugs all the right places and skims the others  feels like pajamas  and looks great for any occasion? i am about 120  5'-1'  32 dd  usually a 4 petite. i ordered the petite small in navy and it fits just like the model photos. i tried it on in the store in a regular small and x-small  and could have gone with either  but the petite had better proportions  especially where the v-neck hit (i would have had to wear a very low plunge bra wi
1,"This is a love at first sight item! bought that home after seeing it on the model. very soft and lovely! especially love the tie back! i wore it with a t shirt underneath. i am 5'4"" and size small. i bought xs and still a bit long. wish they have petite at the store."
1,These are beautiful and very comfy. they do run very large. i ordered the green in medium and deciding wether to exchange for a small. the washing instructions in the pants are to dry clean for best results. the description needs to be updated to reflect this.
0,First  the good: i like the basic shape of the jacket  with its crisply cut lapels  and rounded corners at the bottom...the functional pockets (including the  cool watch pocket)  the size of the buttons  the color. i got the honey   and it was lovely and intense . now  the bad:  i got the regular 8. the jacket is at least an inch too short. although it's  a small  tight 8  the sleeves are strikingly too long. they would have to  be folded  and the lining which would show is not that attractive.
1,This top is awesome!! it is feminine and flattering at the same time! the color also makes it a little romantic. i will wear it with jeans or very a little dressier night out  black pants. buy this and you will not be disappointed!
0,I tried this on in my usual size and it was tight through the chest because of the lining. i would have preferred to wear a cami beneath and then it may have worked. the color and pattern are gorgeous  the fabric feels a bit weird  kind of dry and rough? would have liked to see this in a longer length  and more tapered. it is an absolute pregnant top. so sad its so pretty!
-1,I'm worried about the quality of the shirt. it looks like it may snag easily. i've decided to keep it  so hopefully i will get some use out of it. in hindsight i would have not bought it when considering the price and quality of the shirt.
1,Great quality and extremely flattering. bonus that it is on sale. i felt like this dress was a godsend. i am five months pregnant and needed a dress that made me feel comfortable but not frumpy. i think i'll get a lot of mileage out of it  as there's enough stretch to get me through the next few months and then (hopefully!) i can wear it after too. also can be dressed up or down  so appropriate for many occasions. i believe it runs true to size (i sized up  from xs to s  for obvious reasons  but
0,I just received these jeans and the fit it good. but they smell like moth balls and i have washed them twice already. i hope it will go away  otherwise i wasted $100.
-1,I almost ordered this online to wear to a party later this week  but i'm glad i waited to try it on at the store (i wasn't sure if i'd like the length of the petite or regular better.) i was so disappointed and didn't end up getting either! i have two bailey 44 dresses from several years ago that are much more flattering and incredibly soft/comfortable. this fabric on this dress was much rougher and it really bothered me that the stripes cut off at the side seams and then don't match up from the
-1,This looks like the perfect easy sweater with the white shirt appeal to it  but sadly the fit of this number is really off. it looks more like a tent. it must have been clipped in the back or something. i cannot see any scenario in which this would look good...
1,I just love this top  it has a flattering cut  fun summer colors! i purchased the white and paired it with the plata chevron skirt. both pieces go with everything and can be dressed up or down. perfect for traveling. only tricky part for me was reaching all the buttons in the back. highly recommend!! stock more pieces like this retailer!

0,This top would be great if it were longer and the neck wasn't so open. even for a boatneck  the neck was too wide. for those that don't mind showing their stomachs this top will be okay. the material is nice and stretchy and i like the stripes but just way too short for me.
1,Beautiful choice...beautiful fit for my daughter's slim body
-1,Did not work for me. whatsoever. the stripes were adorable but the piece just didn't fit like on the model. the collar was practically choking me and the tie just didn't make my figure look the way it normally does. aka i looked frumpy and chunky  which i'm not. going back.
1,Although it kind of ran big and the material is stiff causing some protrusion off my shoulders  i decided to keep it only because it was unique and still looked cute
1,Very cute top and so comfortable! it runs big i'm between a medium and large. i ordered the large and it's definitely a little big but wearable. i probably should've swapped it for a medium but it's still really cute!
1,I tried this on in the sotre (in balck) as i was planning on ordering the orangey one.  my usual is 0 or 2  sometimes petites. i thought the regular 0 was sjut fine and flattering. fabric is soft  adn every pattern they ahd in store was really nice (no orange-red though). was not overly snug anywhere  and i am a bit braod for my size.  i deceided not to purchase only because i have done seriosu damage in the last month *multiple purcahses) and this was one of 2 i had to pick... if it goes on sal
1,This an absolutely beautiful quality stylish coat but through no fault of the coat  i had to return it because i looked like a bear in it. i'm too short and too round around the middle for this type check and this type material. i wouldn't want to discourage anyone from trying it.
1,This is a fabulous style top! highly recommend this top. comfortable material. retailer is consistently tried and true to a classy style!
-1,Dress looks beautiful  but the fitting is very off. i ordered a size 2 which is the dress size i usually wear ( i'm 5;4 and 115lbs). the chest area fits perfectly  but the hip area is extremely tight and the lower back area was lose. i exchanged it for a 4  the hip area was a bit tight and the shoulders were too lose. if i ordered the 4p  i have a feeling it would be too tight. it feels like  it's meant for someone with very small hips and a large abdomen. also  this dress is very stiff  can't d
-1,Looks fitted on  but this just turned out to be an oversized muumuu on. the fabric also felt cheap.
-1,You can adjust this dress a bit with the straps but it's huge! the colors were also a bit grayish which i didn't expect.
0,I stalked this blouse and when the price dropped  i pounced on the black. sadly  it did nothing for me. i'm a large  sometimes medium  but decided on the large. you'd think it came with its own cami at this price  but no. completely sheer. unwearable without one. the lace is nothing special. the collar is wider in the back  uncomfortable and pulls on the lace in the front. the high/low hem fit me oddly in the back. i'm returning this one.
-1,"I'm 5'7"" 155lbs and ordered a large. it fit  but the arms were awkwardly short. the finish details on the end of each sleeve almost would have to be pushed back to the elbow for it to look right  which would be okay. however  the interior seam of the neckline is cut jaggedly and isn't even finished with any stitching. it's just tucked haphazardly inside the neckline and isn't sewn--it would unravel with washing.     it's soft and snuggly and cute if you get it on super-sale and don't mind it com"
-1,"These are terribly unflattering the wash looks dirty and the rise is not 10.5 like the description says  which is the only reason i gambled on these it is 13""."
0,This design looks really sharp on the image  but in reality this jacket felt more like a jacket you would get at forever xxi.  the fabric had that polyester/shiny quality to it that made it look cheap.  since the fabric was pretty soft  with a gray jersey lining  it felt more like a padded jacket than a constructed blazer.      i also thought the cut was small if you have a bust larger than a b  i felt like i was busting out of a size 8  and i am a 34d.
1,"I'm 5'5"" 120 lbs and i bought these in a 0. they fit great. i wore them for upwards of 12 hours and i was very comfortable. i received compliments on the print and cut. very flattering."
0,This top runs large. i am a 34 d and usually a medium or small. the medium was a little loose in the bust  but incredibly loose and swingy in the waist. my figure was lost in the fabric. the small was too small for me in the bust  although the waist looked more flattering. the coral color was lovely and bright and not too sheer.
1,Absolutely love this jacket!! i convinced my girlfriend to get one too; we could not be more pleased. slightly oversized throughout the body - this is true no matter the size you buy - with great contrasting sleeves and back. the side ribbons can be adjusted to bring in or let out the waist. perfect spring/summer weight. can be worn with a sweater/sweatshirt underneath. it's a feminine takeover of a boyfriend jacket - looks gorgeous over a casual dress or great with jeans/chinos. perfect for mus
0,Very pretty  romantic
1,I absolutely love this pullover and am so glad i purchased it. it is the perfect weight for fall/winter  super soft  true to size. the diamond shape opening in back looks great with my strappy yoga bras  i have received compliments every time i wear it. i am 6'  144lb  slim/athletic build and often have trouble with sleeve length. this however is perfect & i can use the thumb holes as designed without stretching the sleeves in an awkward way. wish it came in more colors!
1,"Clothes generally tend to look great when you're svelte. hence thin models. i've recently put on a few pounds (normally a 4-6  xs  small in retailer  5'6"" and i have boobs) and when i get lazy and eat a little too much i get it around the middle. i already have a chest so that makes finding clothes to look flattering harder bc the boobs create the apple effect. all that said just to make the point that this is a flattering sweater. i grabbed it last minute on the way to the dressing room  but i ne"
-1,The shirt is very soft but it felt very large and unflattering. the back felt bulky and looked awkward. definitely returning.
-1,I ordered this dress in the green color. the dress did not look like the picture. i returned the dress since it looked like something to wear to a farm barnyard dance. i returned the dress.
-1,I was really disappointed when i tried this top on. the design and cut of the neckline is very bulky and just off. the cut of the top overall was just off.
0,The print on this dress is really pretty and the styling with the lace is a nice touch. unfortunately  it runs quite small in the bust  so i had to return it. for someone that is small busted  it will be quite cute. everywhere else it is true to size.
-1,"Was excited to try this interesting skirt  as a mega bailey 44 fan. however  this skirt didn't fit well. the waist was fine but it then was boxy and shapeless on me in an xs/size 0. my piece also had a wrinkle from folding and i'm not sure how it would easily come out but the main thing is that the lines weren't flattering to the body. the ""vegan"" quilting isn't luxurious. i thought the diagonal zipper style was cool but it doesn't lay to advantage when worn and i'm an easy fit. length is so-so "
-1,"The shirt is absolutely cute looking. but that's just that....looks. i'm 5'2"" size 6 & wears m to l top. i tried on the medium in the store  it was rather flowing. i liked it. but i didn't like how it fit on the underarm area. it hung very low. so i ordered a petite m. still the same. plus the store the lighting was dark so i didn't realize how see through the shirt was too. had to return it."
-1,Looks great on the picture but when it arrived it was a great disappointment  both the colors and style. the material seems great quality but it's stiff and scratchy  the style is very boxy  and as another reviewer said  just hung. i'm a brunette and the colors looked terrible on me. back it goes.
0,I wanted this dress so bad for a trip to hawaii. i sized up when i saw the side zip because i'm a little larger in the top than bottom  but whoa... even when sizing up  i think i would have needed to size up like 3x to get this to work. the dress is adorable  and if you have a smaller bust  it will work for you... so sad it wouldn't work for me.
1,"I ordered this dress for a special event and i am so incredibly happy with it! i am 5'1""  97 lbs  32b and ordered a 0 petite. fits like a glove. the dress has a slight give to it  but main dress fabric is a thick material so order your usual size. fits close through the waist and flares out below. the length hit above the knee so not too short  although i wouldn't want it any shorter. my main worry was whether my bra would show in the back  but i had no issue. overall  the dress is stunning with"
1,Adorable jacket. i ordered the medium (5'4  135 lbs). sleeves are long and have to roll them up. ordering the petite medium to see if it fits better. pink color is great.
1,Beautiful flowing feminine dress. runs large; size down. hot pink color. well made.
0,This is an oversized tee with a somewhat flattering fit. material is very thin. i ordered white  which was completely see-through. not at all what i was expecting. might work better in a darker color  but i returned it since it was nothing special.
-1,I have had this shirt for a little over a month. i've wore it maybe 3-5 times and there is a small hole in the middle of the sleeve on my shoulder. it's not even on a seam  so i can't fix it. i expect much better quality from retailer. don't buy this. the quality is very disappointing. which is really unfortunate because this is a very nice fitting shirt and goes well with pencil skirts.
-1,Not sure who this is for but its not for me. skirt was long  stiff and puffy on my hips. i could not get it to lie correctly. maybe you have to be 6' to pull this off...
1,So stunning  i had to have it for my spring wardrobe! fits true to size and fits well in the bust and is looser on the bottom. the model weara it just as it fits on me. if you have a large bust you may need to size up as the fabric isn't stretchy.
0,Did not notice small hole and stain on the bottoms until i had the tags removed the return label shredded.
-1,I really wanted to like this top. in person though  the fit was too large and boxy. i did order a smaller size based on other reviews but it was still too sacklike. i got the grey motif pattern which i thought was quite pretty and interesting. the material was nice and lightweight. perhaps it would look better on someone with a straight figure and small bust.
1,I love this flirty  well fitted dress! quality material!
0,I received these pants  but they are not as pictured  see the photo of the back pockets  there is a detail there that was not on the pants that i received. i'm not sure about these  the quality is nice  but they are much baggier than shown and i ordered 2 sizes down.
0,The fabric and design are gorgeous so i was hoping the top would work for me. sadly  it looked ridiculous on me. i wouldn't recommend the top for busty girls. it looked like a bell on me. fyi  it doesn't come with a camisole underneath.
1,"I really love the colors of this top  especially in the pinky pastels. it fits really well  can be tied or untied  and will pair with just about anything from skinny jeans to pilcro shorts. speaking of that  i do recommend pairing it with skinny pants or crops because it does have that classic retailer ""am i hiding a pregnancy"" feel to it.     but...the price tag. $98 for a tank blouse is just too much for me. i will save this one in my shopping bag and hope it's still available once it goes on sa"
0,"The design of this dress is darling and so unique  and it's very well made. but i agree it's very boxy and overwhelming for a petite frame. i'm 5'3"" and ordered the 2  and it was like wearing a hospital gown. if a petite were available i'd have tried that  but this one's going back. shame  too  because it's adorable. the gap in the neckline could easily be stitched or sewn shut  but that's an inconvenience when this dress is already priced so high."
0,"I loved how this jacket looked online and decided to order it. however  sizing can sometimes be tricky for me so i ordered both a petite xs and petite xxs (i'm 5'1""  113 lb  and a bra size 32 c). i tired on the xxs first and was swimming in it! so naturally i thought the xs would be even bigger; but to my surprise the xs fit way more snug! in the end  i still didn't like how loose the xs fit so i returned them both. the material is great quality and it's a cute design. i would recommend trying t"
0,I thought this tank would be so cute and comfy for my daily walks  but it's completely see through.  i sized down one size based on a review from another website and it fits ok  but it's hard to say if it runs tts because i have nothing to compare it to.  if the fabric was a little thicker  this would be the perfect tank.  unless your planning on layering this  i wouldn't recommend.
0,Fabric was a little more shear than i thought it would be - while not a big deal - it was missing a few of the silver beads along the front line of the top. returned
1,The photos don't do the top justice. the split back is very unique and adorable. i typically take a size 8 in tops  but ordered a 12 since a reviewer suggested it was narrow in the shoulders. the 12 shoulder fit perfectly  but the body is way too big -- i was swimming it in. i like it enough that i'm going to visit the tailor to take in the body. with the sale price  it is worth tailoring.
0,Has i read the reviews would have realized the t-shirt looking sleeves in the pic are attached to the sweater. based on the pic and site description i didnt realize they were attached. i thought it was part of the styling of the undershirt. i think this very much limits the versatility of the sweater. i ordered the white which is a beautiful color and very soft. i am returning it cause i do not like the t-shirt sleeve. would rather have the flexibility to layer whatever shirt i wanted
1,I love the coral color! allows me to add color to my neutral wardrobe! very flattering!!! i get a lot of compliments on them!
-1,So disappointing! everything i've owned from bordeaux has washed well and stood the test of time. one wash and this was ruined! shrunk terrible even after washing in cold water on delicate and laying flat to dry. completely ruined. returned it.
1,"Everything about this dress is perfect...the material  style  and fit. flattering and comfortable. i'm 5'9"" and the length was just above the knee. you can dress it up or down. comfortable. i definitely recommend."
-1,"This style is right up my alley and i was excited to receive it. however  it is seriously overpriced. i ordered the white and the material is thin and see-through. the small was even a bit roomy (5'7""  140lbs  32dd). going back unfortunately."
-1,Loved the brushstroke design and simplicity of black on white; however  the tee was way too big. it looked boxy and sloppy.
0,I tend to size up when ordering tops online as i find a lot of retailer stuff to be inconsistent. a little big is better than something way to small. well that was a mistake with this top. i sized up and it was much too large everywhere  more so than i thought it would be. but the neck  there's no button or hook and i could barely get the top over my head! if i had gotten a size smaller i wonder if it would have ripped as i pulled it on. cute top  material is so-so.
-1,This a great skirt for someone with a straight or boyish figure. this skirt does not accommodate a curvy figure - small waist  feminine hips.
1,Comfy cozy!
0,I like the idea of the dress  just not the fit in the bust. i'm not particularly big (32c)  but it just didn't fit up there. i wish the dress had built in support because you can't really wear a bra.
0,This may be lovely on some people but it didn't work on me at all. i thought it would have some swing to it but the bottom hem was tight. if i had gone up a size  the top would have been huge. the bib wasn't flattering on me and it's also quite sheer. too bad because the print is great. maybe if you're athletic with slim hips you can manage it. i think if you are busty this could look like maternity wear on you. back it went  sadly.
1,Anytime i see this brand at retailer in a button down  i have to buy it. fit is always so flattering  comfy and the prints are always great!
1,Feminine and lovely flutters indeed. i am on the fence. i ordered in a petite - had to size down - and something about bust and arm holes not completely right. given the light and airiness of this tank it does not seem right to have to wear a camisole underneath which is what it would need for work wear.
1,"These are great quality and hang very nice. tts. i'm 5'6"" and about 130lbs and the 2 fit and hit just above the ankle."
0,The fabric is beautiful  even the lining is lovely. i ordered the green color in a large  as i'm curvy and have long arms. but it just doesn't lay correctly at all - the collar has no structure  even though it's a lapel  and the side vents just pop out - the jacket added about 10lbs  and just looked frumpy. it looks much more tailored on the model. too bad  as i have been looking for a velvet blazer in the color for a long time.
1,This looks beautiful and fits true-to-size. the material has enough weight so that it hangs well. this is a very form-fitting dress - i wouldn't recommend it to someone uncomfortable with a close fitting style.
-1,I feel in love with this piece. the color are gorgeous and i received so many compliments. it lifted my mood just wearing it! sadly  ut the end of the first wear i had a run up the front and by the middle of the second wear the light fabric got caught on something and a hole developed. upon further inspection i found another hole at the top where the price tag must have been attached. i also noticed all over pilling after the first wear! so sad! they should recreate this in a heavy fabric.
0,Love the warm fuzzies of this sweater  did not love the unflattering cut. the sweater hung lifelessly from my bust line down. plus  it was a little short in the front. i have to send it back. :(
0,This is a very pretty color. loved the flow and the length of this top. however the neck hole seemed too small for the top. all the embroidering is at the neck and makes that part very stiff. going back
-1,I wanted these culottes to work so much! the fabric is gorgeous  but the size i ordered didn't fit. i'm normally a size 28 in pants  and i ordered a size 8. it was way too tight and made me look like i had a pooch in the zipper area. not what i wanted it to be. had to return them unfortunately.
0,Why does the lining stop at mid thigh when the skirt is long? makes product look cheap while wearing. love the color  the fabric  and the fit  but cant get past this less than quality feature - will be returning.
-1,Love the print and was looking forward to this dress. the length and bust are just right in normal sizing  however the 'swing' effect is all off. there's so much fabric. its like wearing a moo moo. not at all flattering. disappointed in this one.
-1,"After reading the reviews  i had high hopes for this dress but was disappointed that it wasn't flattering on me.   i'm 5'4""  126 pounds and generally wear a size small  but the small of this dress looked more like a maternity outfit on me. it squeezed the bust a bit too much  and left open some of the areas just under the arms that could probably have used a teensy bit more coverage to be truly flattering."
-1,This dress is beautifully made  but it does not flair slightly as in the photo  it stick out like a tent. it might be a good maternity dress. the fabric is somewhat stiff andheavy with a slight texture.

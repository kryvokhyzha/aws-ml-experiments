-1,"Absolutely loved this top but after i washed it the underside color ran at the stitching. it is all white on the outside but at the bottom hem it has a really cool 1"" lining in a mustard color. i did a cold water wash and flat to dry. i noticed around the stitching at the bottom the mustard color has bled through just at the area of the mustard color stitching.     i am so disappointed b/c i loved this top."
0,I bought the stained glass top/bottoms. the print is very pretty. however  the tankini top itself is not well-made. the front of it (chest area) turns out so that you can see part of the inside of the suit (which is white). it doesn't lay flat around the top  and so it shows more of your chest on one side. for the price  i don't think it is worth it. i don't like to wear it because it makes me feel uncomfortable.
1,I have three pairs of these in different colors (one pair is striped) and i love them. they are flattering and comfy. they go with nearly everything. can't get enough!!!!!
0,"I loved the color and lines of this jumpsuit  but found it to be far too short in the torso. (and about 8"" too long in the leg  but that's a lot easier to fix.) i tried sizing up  but it still wasn't working for me. i'm only 5'7""  and while i'm long-waisted i can usually make jumpsuits work. if you have a short torso and long legs  this is a beautiful option. otherwise  i can't recommend it."
0,It's a beautiful sweater but it is very wide (much wider than it looks on the model)  even in the xs/s. it is also fairly itchy. just way too big for my small frame  which is not really the look i was going for.
1,These chinos fit great! they are extremely comfortable and true to size but note that they do loosen up quite a bit with wear. i bought all 3 colors!
0,I absolutely loved this dress  the style is flattering and the mix of fabrics and lace make it truly feminine and unique. the only problem is the bust runs really small. i normally wear a 4-6 in retailer but i ordered a 6 and and 8 and both were way to tight in the bust. very disappointed because i really wanted to keep this dress.
0,This sweater is very pretty  i love the knit and the cream color. for some reason it just didn't flow the way i wanted it to  and i didn't love the v neck. just didn't pull me in completely!
-1,Such a cute pattern  and i loved the fold-over design  but beware - there is not enough bottom coverage! i should've looked more closely at the photo - it's pretty accurate in showing the bathing suit bottoms have limited rear coverage. a couple more inches of fabric would've really helped. i'm used to fuller coverage bathing suit bottoms  and these just expose way more cheek than i felt comfortable with. i could maybe wear them around my husband  but definitely not my dad! i felt like if i bent
0,Cute pattern  but the shirt is very thin and runs small and short!
0,I had to return this because the lining is super short and uneven. its shorter in the back and falls weird. i love the color even better than the picture. but quality is lacking for this high price. i ordered the 4 petite and it fit but the elastic waist shows any bump in your tummy too. bummer
1,I love this shirt so much i came back and bought it in black (i originally got the lavender color). it is super easy to wear and has a delicate quality to it (though i washed it on a regular cycle and it's holding up well!). as you can see from the photos  because of the wrap style  the middle of the front is shorter than the rest of the shirt. i've worn this top with regular rise jeans and haven't had a problem  though if you lift your arms  your belly may show. i purchased my usual size small
1,Love this color! when i saw this beautiful blue color in the store i had to try them on! so pretty! if you love pilcro chinos--you will be happy with these! same great fit and an awesome color!
-1,I had to return this blouse because it ended up been too small and super itchy. im kind of busty but medium usually works and this one was super tight across my chest. not comfortable at all and the fabric is kind of a sheer with the sparkly lines in silver. wouldn't recommend it.
-1,The dress arrived with a few snags and the fabric already pilling. the fabric will only get worse with wear. return. cute concept; poor fabric quality.
-1,The fabric felt cheap and i didn't find it to be a flattering top. for reference i am wearing a medium in the photos and my measurements are 38-30-40.
1,I love this vest and could not leave without it. the color and lining just make it perfect  so stylish and comfy! i'm always a 8/10 and a m in this was perfect. the color is so beautiful and its so easy to dress up and down. i am big on the bottom  the tie in the back adds a nice shape to your whole profile and makes it a less boxy vest! love love...
1,I love this dress because it's so comfortable and has this hippie peasant vibe that i don't generally wear. plus it's a three season dress with pockets! bought the medium but i should have sized down to a small. on top i'm a m/l girl and the medium is huge. i'm not going to exchange since i wear a sweater over it right now. this dress looks good with or without a belt  with long boots  booties and sandals. so happy with this purchase!
0,I agree with the other reviewer  this is a nice piece. i felt so-so about it when i tried it on though. see below.    ___________  pros:  - not too heavy or warm due to being part linen/cotton blend  making it breathable and great for more milder temperatures.  - soft floral arrangements with lovely pattern throughout the sweater.  - lovely collar giving it a sophisticated feel.  - ran tts. i'm 5'9  hourglass with some meat on my bones and found the medium to be an ideal fit.  ___________  cons:
1,"This top is simple but beautiful. i am either a large or xl but purchased this in the xl. it is a swing top  but has a beautiful flow to it which is not overbearing. i am around 5'6"" and slightly on the broad side and do not feel overpowered by this shirt at all.  i love a top that can be worn everyday with a pair of jeans or dressed up with a pair of slacks. the plus to this top is that it can born worn almost year round which i like.  a great staple for your closet."
0,I love the look of this top. i'm usually a size 12 or 14 and i tried on a size l and it seemed really big  and looked a little like a maternity top. i thought maybe it was too big and ordered a size m. unfortunately  it still looked maternity-ish. i think the bottom of this is flared so much that if you have a big bust at all  it will look like a maternity top on you.
-1,This reminded me of big bird in person and just adds volume to your body. i'm thin and usually wear a size 0  so i'm not sure who this may look good on.
1,"I can't wait for our warmer weather to arrive here in minnesota so i can wear this lovely tank top. the style is so flattering  it doesn't bag out to make you look pregnant. the back yoke is solid navy blue chiffon which is a nice touch. soft fabric  drapes beautifully. the armholes are not oversized. the fabric is opaque so no camisole required.    i am 5'5"" and 120 lbs. and 36a. i purchased size small."
-1,I was so excited to buy this coat  since i missed out on buying the last one. i snagged it quickly before heading out on a trip because this is the perfect plane jacket (i've borrowed my friends). i immediately noticed that the fabric was lighter and softer than the original  and after a few days noticed a lot of pilling on the coat  and a snag on the seam of the shoulder where the arm connects to the body. it's disappointing considering the price you pay. i would return if it still had tags on.
-1,I wanted to love this sweater and it has some nice distinctive features that make it more interesting than your average cardigan. unfortunately  however  i found that flared in an unflattering manner over my stomach. the chest fit well - though it was very low cut - but then if i buttoned the sweater it made me look like at least three sizes larger.  the quality seemed okay  but a bit thin and i was afraid that this would not hold up for long.
-1,Beautifully made shirt however the sizing is way off. the sleeves and across the chest are really tight while the rest of the shirt fits fine. if you get a size larger then the shirt in the body is to large. would recommend if you have really tiny shoulders  arms and chest. such a shame since i really love the shirt.
0,I ordered this shirt in the purple stripe and was happy when it arrived and i really liked the color and style.   however  like the other reviewer  when i tried it on  the little circles on the front line up perfectly with your bra straps.  i even tried a different style bra and had the same result.  sadly i returned it yesterday.
1,This top fits exactly like the last photo  which was my hope. it is not as slim as the other images. it's a swing top and the arm holes are perfect size  and the mock turtleneck is not too high. the fabric is thick  so will be perfect transitioning from summer to fall.
-1,This dress has a great shape and fabric - but the v neckline is too deep/low and the arm holes are also cut too low. would loved to have been able to keep it but had to return.
1,I have featured a picture below. i'm 5 feet 120 lbs. i ordered an xs petite. i'm pretty busty so i don't like a loose fitting top  so ordering a size down did the trick. it's super soft  one of a kind and the edging of the neckline is delicate looking and soft and therefore adds a feminine element. i'm enjoying wearing the top.
0,Adorable suit  super cute print and great quality  but unfortunately not as flattering as other reviewers noted. i found that the white pattern accentuated the wrong areas and the ruffle feature was a bit over-the-top. the straps are also very thin and didn't offer too much support.
1,"I saw these on the freshly cut + promo discount & decided to order my usual size 28 reg in pilcro. a great fit & appreciate the midrise. not too snug or baggy. look pretty much on me as in the model pic except they fall abt 1"" below my ankles. i am only 5'3"" so not a surprise they are a little longer on me but it's really ok. fyi - the front button & back pocket tacks are gold which gives a classy look to these jeans. just love.. & love the price too! 5'3""  117#"
-1,Fits large  wrinkles easily and not what i expected for the price.
1,I bought this in size xl and it initially fit me similarly to the model. but  once i washed it (in cold in my machine  reshaped and air-dried)  it was so much smaller/shorter. i loved the embroidery on the top. the mix of pattern colors is great too. i like when blues and blacks are mixed together. i don't know how i could have prevented the shrinking. i now throw on a shrug or jacket over to hide the shorter length. still stylish and fun.
-1,The design is gorgeous  the fit is great and the fabric drapes beautifully and is very comfortable. however  it's extremely see thru.
-1,I ordered a small and the top part was huge yet the bottom a little snug. you need a big chest and small legs and bottom. too bad. it's very cute.
-1,"Wanted to love this sweater for its beautiful colors and cute graphic  but the fit is uncomfortably small and it is so itchy i was yelling  ""get it off"" in the fitting room. bummer."
0,I sized down one size and it's still too big with the double v-neck style. this is going back.
-1,I wish i had read all the reviews before purchasing. the sweater looked liked everything i would be interested in online. once i pulled it out of the bag  my first thought was how could retailer send me a used  washed and shrunken sweater. it is nothing like the picture. it fits like a midriff top  not exaggerating. i'm 5.6  ordered the m  don't waste your shipping money on this.
-1,I thought the sweater itself was beautiful  but found the fabric to be stiff and itchy.
1,I bought this blouse after i saw my aunt wearing it. the color is lovely. i spilled soup on it during my first wearing and it laundered wonderfully. i am so glad! such an easy piece to throw on  very comfortable. fit is great.
0,This top is gorgeous in both detail in color. it fit great and true to size  but then i hand washed it as instructed on the label and it shrank substantially to the point that it's now too short and needs to be returned.
1,I love this jacket - can dress it up or dress it down. over a dress  skirt or jeans. very soft and flattering!
-1,There were just too many pleats to this thing. it was not flattering. it looks fantastic on this model but not on me. oh well.
0,This is a beautiful dress. i sized up 2 sizes based on other reviews and it fits well. it is on the shorter side. i purchased the blue and it's a beautiful color. i was in love with the dress until the zipper burst open after wearing it for five minutes. i think i'm going to have the zipper replaced because i like it so much. but at the high price point there should be a functional zipper.
0,I wear a 32 and sometimes a 31 but i could barely squeeze these on in a 32. the fabric is thick with lots of stretch but these are super skinny all the way to the ankle like a legging and not a jean. made for much thinner frames than mine.
1,I love the print on this. love. and the fit  for a swing blouse  was super flattering! typically i haven't found that to be true  but this one is so nice! i loved it so much  but i just couldn't find a ton of outfits to wear with such a unique piece. i have been trying to slim my closet so i did return this  but perhaps would purchase it on sale (to justify wearing it less). i typically wear a 4 in tops and dresses and took an xs.
1,I bought this top to add some more color and pattern to my summer wardrobe. it is really cute and a flattering cut. i just had a baby  so it's perfect for showing some curves without clinging. if anything  i'd say it maximizes my bustline more than i expected  but is still very flattering. i think i'm still getting used to my new bustline ;) soft  comfy fabric. not too hot. i get compliments when i wear it!
-1,Poor quality  material looks much thinner and cheaper than pictured.
-1,Sometimes i order things online that i can hardly wait to arrive  and then once they do  i wonder if i made a mistake when ordering it. this is one of those times  and it was not my mistake. the shirt i received is not like this one. it is an xs  but it is quite large falling inches below where this one hits on the model. everyone i have shown the shirt to says that it is a denim blue color  not grey at all. it is a pretty color  but not what i thought i was ordering. i hate it when this happens
1,I saw this dress online this morning  went into a store this afternoon and walked out with it! i love this brand because the designs are modest  but feminine and practical. this dress is made of a thicker study cotton with beautiful all over embroidery. the fit is tts  and you can adjust the waist to fit loose or a bit more snug. the length is just above my knee at 5'3. i plan to wear this now with black boots and a furry vest  and later by itself with sandals and big sunnies!
-1,I was looking for an oversized silhouette but this is more like a beach cover-up. the waist does not have elastic or any structure. the top fabric is crossed over but not sewn closed  and because the fit is so loose it just gaps open. the fabric is nice quality but i am returning.
-1,Really cute piece  but it's huge. i ordered an xxs petite and it was unfortunately extremely wide and not flattering. returning.
0,I was disappointed with this jumpsuit. when i first saw it in the store  i thought i was going to love it. when i tried it on  the first issue is the fabric is too sheer. i could completely see the outline of my underwear and bra. it also runs way too big! i know the bottom is supposed to be loose and flowy  but the waist needs to be more tapered to off set that  and it's so baggy. the arm holes are also cut very low  so when you lift your arms you can see most of your bra on the sides   i wante
0,"I fell in love with this dress in the store and have been so excited to receive my size in the mail  but the proportions are all off! even the petite size is too long in the torso  and the regular is laughable for anyone that isn't an amazon princess. and i'm not even that short (5'4"")!  curvy ladies  also keep in mind that though the rest of the dress stretches nicely  the grosgrain ribbon detailing in the midsection does not  and will cut into any extra flesh hiding out on those hips. i would"
1,Bought these online - sale  and am really happy with them. soft and light material - feel breezy  like a beach pant should!
-1,The button fell off when i took it out of the bag  and i noticed that all of the thread had unraveled. will be returning :-(
1,"Loved it on the hanger and when i tried it on. it's a gorgeous shade of blue (denim  not navy) with some light tie-dye streaking along the top and sides which add interest. the ""bat wing"" feature is a little limiting; i won't be able to reach anything high without the whole top coming up with me. as for the material  it's an interesting blend bc it isn't soft or rough. some may say it's itchy and some may say it's soft  to me it isn't either. it's merely smooth enough. which sounds terrible  ""it"
0,I fell in love with the shirt when i saw it online; but  i was incredibly disappointed with it when it was delivered.  on the positive side  the macrame is stunning.  once again  there was way too much fabric which makes me look pregnant.  most importantly  the color is not peach!  it's almost a burnt indian red or brick red/orange.  it was a disgusting color.
1,"Love the color  fit and feel of these jeans.  the thin material is stretchy and comfortable. i didn't have to pull them up every so often during a 3 hour party.  they didn't bag out after the first wearing and are true to size.  i got a 27p (5'2""  115#).  the leg length is perfect and ends at the ankle.  the rise wasn't too low for me.  highly recommend!"
0,The top falls nicely  great quality  the lace is beautiful. however  the sleeves are too wide and puffy. the top is voluminous and i wished it had more form fitting sleeves to balance this out. the top does not look flattering on me so i will be returning it.
-1,When i tried these on in the store i was thrilled - they were comfy as yoga pants and  the fit was divine. i thought i had found the perfect jeans and i splurged on them for my birthday. after wearing just two times they are baggy and the knees are totally bagged out  saggy and faded.  so disappointing - i want my $180 back!
1,"I loved this top  and i normally order petites when i'm able to  but this wasn't offered in a petite size so i took a chance and ordered it in regular. just got it in the mail and when i pulled it out i thought wow  it is a petite! but its not  just runs small. i got the xs size and it was tight under the arms  and the peplum bottom came up a bit high and felt slightly maternity-ish the way the bottom part flared out. i actually thought it was a bit too short too  even on me (5'2""  about 118 lbs"
-1,Beautiful dress but have to return. way too big & long for me. medium is the size i wear but i think i would need an extra small.
1,I saw this duster and immediately ordered it in cream. i have worn it every chance i get. it goes well with dresses as well as shorts or jeans. the length is perfect  the design is flattering  and the material is soft and comfortable. the sleeves are snug- but i like this feature  especially for light weight summer use over a tank top or sleeveless blouse. this will be a go to item. thanks retailer- another gem!
1,Just beautiful dress! it dits perfectly  tts and i feel like princess in it! highly recommend girls!
0,I loved these when i first got them. they fit perfectly and are the softest and most comfortable pair of cords i've ever owned. plus ag is the only brand of jeans i buy. unfortunately  they stretch out horribly within one wearing. for such a pricey pair of cords  i'm extremely disappointed. i'm not sure if i should've sized down  but now i'm wishing i had  although i'm not sure that would make a difference.
0,There is a lot of fabric here! the legs fit me fine  but they are long and when you roll them up it creates a bunching of fabric in an awkward area. i've also found that they don't stay rolled up in the back  especially if you sit down. it's a shame since the fabric is soft and comfortable. maybe sizing down would've helped  but i doubt that would've fixed the problem of the cuffs staying rolled up.
1,I wish it was a little bigger.i kept this for it will be wonderful for summer.
0,Sadly  i returned this one. i'm a 36d bra size and this shirt could not handle that. it fit around my chest  so sizing up was not necessary  but my chest caused the straps to shift and sit funny on my shoulders. cute top and well made for those who can fit into it better!
0,These are so cute and the colors are great  however  they stretch out about 2 sizes. they fit me perfectly and i sized down and they stretched out about a size 1/2 to 2 sizes too big. i'm bummed out because they are perfect in every other way. didn't think they would stretch out as much as they did. and they look awful once  they've stretched out. wish i didn't take the tags off or i would have returned them. size down at  least one size  i could have sized down two sizes. hoping they shrink lik

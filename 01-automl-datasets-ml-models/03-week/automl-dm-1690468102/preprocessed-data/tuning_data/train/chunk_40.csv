1,My favorite new dress. i love the feel and slight weight of the fabric. it's very flattering and easy to wear.
0,I am a huge fan of pilcro pants  and was so excited to see them make a pair of vegan leather pants. the idea is great - leather in the front  fully stretchy fabric in the back to give a fitted but comfortable look. however  i couldn't get past the way the seams and leather felt on my knees - really stiff and uncomfortable when you start walking around (can't bend the leg all the way; weird creasing and bunching behind the knee). the fit was perfect everywhere else. sadly  these had to go back :(
0,Love the design  material  and color...the sizing as listed is waaaaay off (running small). returned to store (after purchase online) 3 times to get one that fits  which was at least generally easy :o
1,Wonderful and comfortable dress  very sweet.
-1,I pretty much am in agreement with the first  original reviewer on here. big disappointment  especially if you have hips and are busty.  _____________  pros:  - great breathable fabric.  - cute look overall.  - sash in front brings it all together.  - buttons are hidden under a panel of fabric  which is a nice touch.  ____________  cons:  - runs very small in the bust. normally  i can wear a 10 or 12 with most of retailer's stuff. i tried on a 12 and it fit everywhere with entirely too much room i
-1,This was a disappointment because beautiful fabrics with interesting design are a rarity--and especially at this length! unfortunately  this is a mess in terms of proportions. if a size 2 can barely get it off  then there is a design flaw. sadly  the fit was so strange that it did not seem that simply sizing up would correct the flaws.
1,"The design and colors on this sweater arguably make it a ""statement sweater"". it has a modified raglan type sleeve. i found the sleeves to fit just fine. for reference  i am 5'9""  150 lbs.  34dddd  and the medium fit perfectly. it is not a long sweater and  with my height  i wear a long tank top or cami underneath. i love the way it looks."
1,Bought these in both moss and navy. fits perfect  love the style and the roll down waist. excellent quality.  bought the peachy color top with the elephants to wear with the moss colored one and received lots of compliments.
0,Dress ran very large in every way. beautiful design  lining and quality material. i should have sized down 2 sizes. item is now sold out.
-1,I liked the design and i didn't mind that is see through  but i couldn't put it on ! not size 8 what is my usual size   not size 10 or 12  even 14! my shoulders wouldn't go through the middle part and it is not stretchy   so disappointed. i really wanted to like it.
0,"I so wanted to love this dress! the color and fabrics are beautiful and scream summer! i was so disappointed by the fit through. the different fabrics are such a cool concept but it wasn't executed that well. one material is pleated like an accordion so wants to ""constrict""  the next material is crocheted so is a little more stiff and the third material is pretty average. on the bottom where it's flowy it doesn't make that much of a difference  but on top and in the middle it gives this weird ""i"
0,For reference: 5'3  130#  athletic/muscular body type (broad shoulders  slim hips)  i'm a bit confused on the sizing for this  especially based on other reviews mentioning they needed to size up. i ordered the xs  and i was swimming in it. i usually am quite comfortable in size small  so i'm not sure why the xs was still too big. perhaps you need hips for this dress to work  because it was really just hanging on me and not figure flattering at all. i'm not sure if ordering the xxs would make thi
-1,Way too long...the sizing is incredibly off on this product. order a size or two down.
0,I saw this in my local retailer store and thought it was super cute. tried it on and was delighted. the top fits nice and looks crisp and nice - a great nautical look. the brass buttons add a pop to the shirt that is very nice. i usually wear between a medium and large in retailer shirts and the large fit perfectly. i am a 34d for reference and usually a size 12 on top.     i bought the top and didn't notice until i got home that it is dry clean only! yikes. i hate that. this is a casual top to me.
-1,This top is absolutely gorgeous  but i followed the care tag to a t and it completely fell apart in the wash. will be returning.
0,"Didn't love it  didn't hate  rather indifferent. the grey was a little more muted than i wanted for a summer tee.  i'm 5'4""  123lbs  34a  the xs fit if it wouldn't shrink  if you're about this size but larger busted go with the s."
0,I didn't have any problems with the fit  i love the puffin pattern  the material is nice---it's just so short. i really haven't decided if the print is worth the awkwardness of the length  or if i'll just keep it and only wear it when it's cool enough outside to wear a tank under it  so i can avoid flashing my stomach every time i lift my arms. but  yeah...it stops right at my waist in front. way too short--stop making these great shirts so short  please.
1,I am 5'7  115 lbs  and tried on a 0. the dress (red) looked great and i loved how it had a slimming effect  and i could wear this to work and the length is appropriate. it fit great  but it was a pain to get out of for some reason. i tried to get out of it through the bottom  but it kept getting stuck on my hips. i eventually got it out through the head  but it was such a pain that i just got frustrated. the fabric is okay- i expected a slightly better quality fabric for the price.
1,This coat is just as nice as the russian one from a few years ago  and fits the same. it is stunning! i swear  life is way too short to wear only average coats. if you are a parks and recreation fan  think back to the treat yo self episode.....and you'll know what i mean! i can't say enough wonderful things about this one.
-1,Much lower quality than other robes i have purchased
0,I ordered these hoping they would look like the model - but they didn't. i am small but curvy. it hugged too tightly in the hips so sadly  these pants are going back.
0,I bought three of these this summer--a mint  ivory  and yellow. when i received them  they looked nice enough in person. i liked the heart motif and the peplum. the problem is the knit was on the cheap side and stretched out. the arms were tighter than i liked but loosened up through the day. but  then the look became more matronly. i wish they had been 3/4 length or a vest. the cheap  outstretched look just didn't work. i ended up donating all of mine after a few wears. they also pilled conside
0,The dress is adorable and has a very nice fabric and a slip that goes underneath. it was just too big for me even as a swing dress.
0,...for real  reinforce all the buttons before you wear it out. i've had three different ones pop right off.
-1,Hate i have to return it - way too long-almost more mid thigh/almost dress length.
0,I'm normally a 10/12 and ordered the m/l. the body was a little big but ok. the arms are really wide. there are snaps to make them tighter but it doesn't do much. i do like the embroidery. it's an ok jacket but the fit could have been better.
1,This dress is adorable. it's very comfortable and so flattering. the only thing is i can't understand why it is priced so high. it's a great dress  but i'm just not convinced it's the worth the price tag. i'm going to watch for it to go on sale. fingers crossed!
0,"For me  at 5'9""  the top was not long enough...it appeared longer in the photo. i'll be returning it. other than length  it is cute."
-1,I loved them on when i got them  but they literally frayed apart on my body as i wore them  and i had them on no more than 5 times. it was not a fit issue or a seam issue; they literally just frayed apart in two areas.  while flattering and incredibly comfortable  the fabric was not at all durable...they are not your typical  denim   they almost kind of a knit feel them.
0,Like the other reviewers i was disappointed to receive the gray dotted sweatshirt with a zipper down the center when it was not in the model picture. looks like this item has since been removed from this listing...would have been nice to have the correct item pictured in the first place.
1,This is my third pair of these pants. they are my everyday staple  good for work or play
-1,After reading the glowing reviews i was excited to buy this on sale. i'm tall and lean  but found the dress looked slightly awkward and off on me compared to the model pictures. firstly  the top has a strange transition to the skirt  with extra fabric you have to either blouse over the skirt or bunch together. if you blouse it and lay flat  it invariably gets bunched as you wear it. this bunching changes the aesthetics of the color blocks  creating less clean lines. i also found the blue  black
1,Great dress that is very flattering. works well with flats or can be dressed up with heels. perfect for travel because the material doesn't wrinkle. would highly recommend this dress!
1,My daughter tried on this shirt in new york & loved it so i ordered it for her for christmas1 i am thrilled  & she will be thrilled! love my purchase!
0,So much odd stuff going on here with the cut/fit. the top is sort of tight in the bust  even with a small chest. the sleeves are dolman-style and are billowy at the top  but then tight on even my skinny arms. the slip plus the dress itself took me a good 5 minutes to figure out how to put on...just too much effort. it is otherwise a beautiful pattern  color  and length. just a miss for me personally in the fit department. bummer!
1,I am not usually one for super girly tops  but i could not resist this top. the material is beautiful and this top can definitely be dressed up or dressed down  i think it is extremely versatile. it is a little bit see-through but if you just wear a nude bra it's perfect! i usually wear a 00 or 0 but i got a 2 in this top because it is a little tight in the sleeves/across the shoulders. but if you size up you should be perfect! super cute and i definitely recommend you get before it sells out!
1,"Got this dress in the blue and cream and it's gorgeous. i love that it's work and date night appropriate  but so comfy. i am 5'4"" but have very short legs  so it's hard to find a maxi dress or skirt that doesn't drag on the ground. this floats beautifully above my ankles - a little lower than on the model  but still high enough that i am totally comfortable wearing the dress without heels. i got the small and it fits great. the print is lovely - the cream fabric is speckled in gray dots in some"
-1,I was so excited to try this on in the store  because i've had my eye on it online. unfortunately  it is not like the picture. the material is very thin  almost translucent. i also could not figure out how it get it on! the cape has short sleeves  not long  as it appears in the picture  and the folds of fabric would not drape quite right in the front. love the look of black design on white. hopefully retailer can redo this in a thicker cape for the fall  but for now  i'll skip this one.
-1,I had high hopes with the other positive reviews  but it didn't work on me. nice stretchy fabric and nice length but it was bunchy in the front and didn't lay well  and didn't do my bust any favors. maybe better on those less pear shaped. hopeless on me.
1,Bought this skirt in the light plum color. nice soft corduroy fabric.  it fit well. not too short.   will be cute this fall with a sweater and boots.   my only complaint. i wish it had pockets.
1,"I tried this dress on in the store.  i wear either a s or xs in retailer clothes.  its loose fitting  so i went with the xs.  the arm holes were tight  but have very cute buttons if you look closely at the picture.  you can also roll the sleeves up and there is a coordinating plaid underneath  which adds a nice touch.  great length  not too short or too long.  the grey color is much prettier in person.  i felt it had a little more of a blue tint. for reference i am 5'6""  124 lbs  and 32b."
1,This has quickly become my go-to cardigan! it's light which will make it great for the spring and summer nights. i got it in the rose... and loved it so much i bought the olive too. bought a small- fits perfectly! arm length is great too.
-1,I thought this would be cute with leggings based upon the length on the model. i forget that the models are almost 6 feet tall. this has a polyester slip goes under it that snaps onto the shoulders. it came down to my knees and was completely like a sack no leggings and boots with this one. lovely material but not at all figure flattering.
-1,"I ordered these along with the regular ag stevie jeans and there is a definite difference in fabiric and cut. i liked the darker fabric but it was thinner and stretchier that the more ""denim"" version. the cut was also looser in the thigh and seat area which made for a looser  less flattering fit. returned it and kept the regular ag stevie."
1,The pictures online do not do this justice. i did not even recognize it as the same dress at first. i went a size down and that way it flatters my curves beautifully instead of looking like a robe. it can actually be worn 3 ways- i like closing the closest snap(there's two) in the middle with a skinny belt over it  and a slip dress underneath. this way  the dress has a deep v neck and opens out in front when walking. think 1940's glam. it can also be fully closed like in the picture  or left ope
0,Nice material  hits high waisted  mine was a return that was not repacked and was just balled in the bag and was so wrinkled that even if it looked good  you couldn't tell. very disappointed to have it arrive in that condition-so not typical of retailer.
-1,I wore these pants to work and they fit and looked great! however the first time i put them through the wash they became all discolored and are completely stained and now are unwearable. very disappointing. did not spend that much money to wear a pair of pants once.
-1,I wanted this jacket to fit on me like in the photo  but i guess my frame was still to petite. the fabric was also on the cheap end
0,Really unique & will easily go with many tops/bottoms. i agree with the other reviewers  it's itchy  but so super cute. the sale price is a good deal. i had already planned to wear with long sleeves so the itchy fabric should not be a problem. i got the xs/s  my usual size.
0,"I so wanted to love this suit! it is so unique and cute  however it does not wear well on a short girl! i am 5""4 and the torso was much too short for me so the cut down the middle looked really wide and odd and the suit just made me look stumpy instead of sexy. also  for how expensive this suit it i also thought the material was pretty thin for how expensive this suit is. i'm sad to say it is going back."
1,I saw this initially in the store and thought it was nice but did not purchase because i thought the price was too high.  i saw it again and it was on sale but the store had sold out of my size.  i checked online and my size was available so i ordered.  i was afraid this cape would be to long and make me look frumpy but it wasn't and i didn't.  it looked great. i tie the belt a little higher than the model to make me look taller.   i can't wait to wear it on cool fall days.
-1,The fabric is a little stiff  the back looks unusually long compared to the front  and it fits tight across the chest. and i'm not busty so that's not a factor.
-1,This sweater was so itchy i immediately was turned off. it looks cute in pictures but another problem was that the knitting in the shoulders looks like a kid made it. it was uneven and stretched out. it looked like it was not well made to me. it also shed so much that just from me trying it on my pants were covered in orange fuzz. i returned this one.
0,I tried this on in-store because i needed a cozy cardigan  but i did not buy it because i felt the quality was poor. it shed all over everything i tried on with it  and i left the store with little balls of sweater flufff all over my pants. disappointed.
1,I was hesitant based on the reviews  but i'm glad i ordered this dress (in blue). the material is like a french dot texture that is soft but still a bit structured. i had no issues with the fit. it's appropriately just a little oversized. the styling is very mod!
0,I was so excited to receive this in the mail as it had been on backorder for awhile. the dress is beautiful  but run smalls the buttons on the back are nearly impossible to fasten. if you are single  good luck trying to get it buttoned. i'll be returning it.
1,Ordered my regular size s early this week and was thrilled to receive them yesterday. they fit just as expected and are quite comfortable. i would definitely recommend them as a nice alternative to pajamas or even as a slip.
-1,I was so excited to try these but was really disappointed in the fit. i found the legs and butt to be tight but the waist to be really big. if you are normally a size 24  i wouldn't bother with these.
1,I had to size up to a medium because otherwise my boobs would not get along well with that button down front  but once that was taken care of i really loved the silhouette this created. the belted waist flatters an hourglass shape nicely. perfect for sipping tea and eating finger pastries like a fancy little lady. i have no idea what i'm going to do when the time comes to wash it though... we'll cross that road when we come to it  i guess. also - the interior seams are a bright  electric blue -
-1,The design of these ankles pants is very cool and the rise is perfect. however  the fabric  despite 2% spandex  has absolutely no give from the knee down. the extensive stitching probably contributes to the lack of stretch. while i was able to pull them on (size 27 for 110 lb/5.4')  i could not bend my legs at the knee comfortably. with longer wear  i think they would cut off the circulation.  please post if these stretch for you enough with wear and become softer.
-1,This is the most unflattering peplum top i have ever tried on. fit perfectly as a size 6 should in the arms  shoulder  chest... then the waist was huge! just hung off of me like a flour sack. it was wider than the chest measurements  which made me appear frumpy instead of tailored and classic. combine that with the high-low hemline and it looked like a project runway reject. sent back immediately  do not buy this if you have (or want to appear to have) an hourglass figure  it will do nothing for
1,I love this dress for it's unique design with the crochet features. it is super comfortable  great for being layered without see through. i ordered a small though and it is still too large for me. i have been trying to decide on returning it since i love it so much. i'd recommend sizing down for this dress. i'm 5'6''  135lbs  and still needed an xs which seems a bit off. i guess i'm used to retailer running a bit big  but i miss judge this one and hate to deal with the mailing and worrying
1,The details and colors are exquisite. stop hesitating and get this dress
0,I'd recommend getting this top- but only after understanding its limitations. it's beautiful and i bought it even after reading the other critical and accurate reviews because i so loved how it paired with the skirt. unless you size down the rigid form of the embellished straps will lie funny  and the rest of the top fits bizarrely as it is both short (it could almost expose the bottom of your stomach) and has lots of fabric so it almost flows out all around you (accentuating your stomach and ma
-1,I loved the look of these pants in the pictures online and i loved the way that they fit. however when i got my pair  the flower placement was completely different. the whole front was black and there were just flowers running out of the crotch seams. i ordered another pair hoping they were just cut wrong  but those were even worse. they looked obscene.
1,Perfect fit. this dress is super flattering  the criss-crossing fabric at the bust looks awesome on. the fabric is a little bit thicker through there which is nice for coverage. the skirt is light and airy and the pattern is so pretty! the perfect spring to summer dress!
0,Ordered this online in the pinkish color. the material is a little thin. as a busty  curvy lady this one just didn't sit right  ran a tad large  and looked boxy. if you have a thinner frame  may be a better look for you. detailing is nice.
-1,"I have loved the pilcrow hyphen chinos  and have purchased many pairs. however  the last 3 pairs i've ordered are all a different cut now. they are no longer the chino i loved  although they have the exact same name. they are now ""boy cut""  and are much more narrow through the hips and thighs. nowhere on the description does it say ""boy cut"". it's not until the package arrives in the mail that i'm saddened to find this changed product with the same number. it really should say this int he descri"
-1,I saw this on a mannequin in the store and so wanted it to work but was just too oversized and bulky. very good quality and material.
1,"I am going to review this pretty much the way the person ahead of me reviewed it. first  the colors are way more vibrant in person than in the photo. there is even a lavender (which you can sort of see under the yellow stripe). it really makes it look different. second  it is monstrously huge. i am 5'3""  110 pounds and i ordered the xs and it completely swallowed me up. because of the vibrancy of the colors  it didn't blend well with my fair complexion and also  it is like a heavy sweater  not a"

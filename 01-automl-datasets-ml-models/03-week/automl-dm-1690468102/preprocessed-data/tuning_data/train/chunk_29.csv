0,This is pretty and provides coverage with a bit of support for wearing around the house. i'm a 34b so i ordered the small- it still had room in it so i tightened the straps and used the tightest hooks on the back  and that makes it fit ok. i bought it just to wear at home since i was not expecting a great deal of support or shaping  and while it feels ok it is not super-comfy- it's a bit scratchy around the edges. i was going to buy another color if i loved this  but as it is i will keep the one
0,These jeans fit perfectly. however  the distress at the knee was a bit too distressed for my taste. i would recommend these jeans for a younger demographic.
-1,"Dress appears to be slim fit  but that's far from the case. usually wear an xs regular because i have a long torso for my 5'3""  but it just hung on me like a heavy sack. i have a hard time finding dresses now that i'm not working and like to have a couple on hand for all purpose occasions--weddings  memorials  special occasions. i hoped this one would meet my needs. disappointed."
1,Love this top.  the fit is perfection!  the fabric is wonderfully soft.  i ordered the green  love this color.  will be ordering it in the grey also..  fits very true to size.
0,While this top is pretty  it's very unflattering. it just looks so boxy on me that it makes me look heavier. too bad  because i really wanted to like it.
0,This is beautiful fabric and a good fit  but it's such a pain to get on and off  that i just don't want to hassle with it. the button is in the back  and very tricky to reach. too bad  because otherwise it's darling!
1,I love the dress overall  however  found it a tad snug in the bust area. overall  a beautiful dress to own.
0,The item i received was not distressed. i bought one size larger thinking they'd be super slouchy  but they just looked sloppy. also  the hips puffed out in a very strange way. i wanted to love since they are so cute and soft  but i look like a man with hips in these jeans. returning this weekend.
0,I ordered the white tee in xs and am returning it. it runs tts & had a good fit but i didn't like the material at all. maybe because it was white  but it was see through & like a tissue tee that i would expect to get little holes in it near the waist. the sleeves are gathered in the center of the sleeve & i didn't like the way that looked.
-1,The first time i wore this tank it started pilling around the arms and down the sides. it is terribly quality  and gets worse with every wear and wash. possibly the worst wear on a new clothing item i've ever seen. like the design and fit  immediately relegated it to a weekend/home shirt because it was unprofessionally pilly and the pills are small so can't be shaved off.
-1,Love the fabric of this shirt even though it was thinner than i expected. it is soft to the skin and flattering. however i returned it because it is made for women with long torso and shorter shoulders.
0,Fabulous fabric  adorable details. fitting is very  very odd. it's non-adjustable in any way. the fabric has no stretch at all around the middle and the underwire of the bra is very stiff which i found painful. the straps were kind of loose  but there is no way to tighten them because of the frills. when i bent over  the shorts exposed the bottom of my butt. i'd get a larger size  but then i can't adjust the straps and they would definitely be too long and leave my breasts very exposed. overall 
-1,As the other reviewer stated the dress is not lined and the fabric feels very cheap. i tried the sp as well and felt i could have gone down to the xsp. i like the style and coloring but given the price and lack of quality this is going back.
1,I purchased this in my usual small (size 4-6) and it fits just the way it shows in the photo. it is very flowy which is th point. i wore it over a black romper and it looked great. i can also wear with jeans and a simple black tank. keep the vest open or use the hook and eye and close it up. seeing the black through the sheer white is simply dreamy!  glad i purchased it during the sale on sale promotion. it is a classic piece for sure.
1,"An retailer associate gave me this to try on since i love white clothing and lace. i tried on a large for my 5'9""  36c. hourglass frame and found it to be a tad large and probably could go down a size. my thoughts are.... _______________ pros: - breathable and comfortable fabric due to cotton/linen blend. - lace detailing at the top is lovely. - runs tts except i found the arms ran a tad small (and i have smaller circumference). but there's enough stretch. _______________ cons: - extremely sheer!"
-1,This looked fabulous on the model  of course  and i love sweater dresses. but even in an xs  i was drowning in fabric and looked ludicrous. concept is good but execution went terribly wrong somewhere. a definite return.
0,"I don't think the sweater looks like the one pictured. it's pretty and i love off the shoulder sweaters  but i have to say it's a little scratchy and its a lighter grey than what shows on my computer screen. if i hadn't gotten it on sale and with an additional birthday discount i would send it back. it also runs big. i got an xs/s and it fits perfectly. im 5'6"" and weigh 140. i usually wear a medium in most things and am a size 8. i like it a lot  but i don't love it. it also reeked of patchouli"
0,I first have to agree with other reviewers about the quality of this sweater: the stitch is pretty  but the fabric isn't nearly as soft as i expected. it has the look and feel of a cheaper sweater. that said  the fit is pretty flattering. i didn't have any problem getting the cowl over my shoulders as pictured by the model. i've been looking for this style of sweater  so i'll probably keep it. however  it really didn't meet my expectations for quality.
1,I bought this dress after i had overnighted a different one and it wasn't going to be delivered on time. i'm so happy that i bought this dress. its so comfortable and easy to wear. i got lots of compliments on it.  it runs very large though. i ended up with a size 6. i initially tried on the 10  as i have a larger chest. the 6 still had plenty of room.
1,I bought this sweater on a whim in the store  without trying it on. when i got home  i decided it would probably lose it's shape and it seemed a big clunky sweater and i planned to return it. a few days later  desperate for something to wear  i grabbed it and decided to keep it - merely to have something to wear that day. i'm so glad i did.    this is a great sweater. layered with a cami  it looks fantastic it does not lose its shape or grow. it is structured  so it doesn't feel sloppy. it has w
-1,Comments. the detail is lovely - especially the dragonflies on the sleeve. and the quality is there with the lining. trouble is this is thick fabric cut in a box shape. imo  you have to be very skinny to pull this off and not look like a tank. i looked at the model (after purchasing) and notice that she has it open and swept back a bit bc if it is not  it is terribly unflattering.
-1,If you have any cleavage this dress will look awful. the ties drop pretty low & look trashy over cleavage. recommend otherwise - good fabric cool look
-1,Like others  i finally received my size 6p black pants after months of waiting.  for starters  these pants run small  so i ordered a size up but still in petite  because i adored the red ones i got this past summer.  when the black pants arrived  they were a full three inches shorter than the red ones (which were also 6p)  and the fabric did not feel anywhere close to the same quality.  i'm debating ordering the regular length  but i'm not sure i'll bother  based on some of the other reviews.
1,Really great best.  nice substantial material and great fit.  will be able to wear with many things.
1,This looks just like the picture. it's soft and very comfortable - looks great with skinny jeans and boots. love it!
-1,I wanted to love this sweater but the fit is just awkward. it is very short and box and ends up being very short in the back. i am going to return this item.
1,Ranna designs richly detailed dresses and this is no exception.  looks just like the pictures (colors/cut/drape) with the exception of a modesty hook at the deep v-neck.  sleeves are sheer with an elastic cuff.  this dress does not stretch--the bodice felt very fitted and tight  especially at the waist band.  runs tts or small; if you're busty/broad shouldered  size up.  it has a dreadful side zip  is fully lined and all synthetic fabric (boo!)  i purchased size 10p  my stats 36c/38-27-35/135#.
-1,Even in my usual petite small size  this looked bulky and made me look stumpy. disappointing because the style looks so good in the picture and the material looks to be good quality. i don't even know if going down a size would have helped. as others have mentioned it looks like a frumpy house robe.
0,The sweater is beautiful. i loved the tweed design. but the fit was boxy and the collar sat funny. so i had to send it back.
1,I received the pants and they are really nice. you can dress them up or down. i ordered a size 0 in regular and they did not fit me well around my thighs  as they were loose. i will have to return them as they do not have my size in petites. i am a size 0 in petites and ordered the size 0 in regular. the only downside to the pants was it was hard to undo the buttons and found it rather difficult.
0,This sweater in the neutral beige coloration was exactly what i wanted to rotate through my winter legging/boot rotation with different vests  belts  and scarves...spot on. it is not heavy weight  soft  perfect length for a tunic on a 5'4 frame  34c  125 lb....now the weird part - sleeves were excessively long and seem to have stretched longer after wear??? anyway  hand wash and little to no pilling a plus. i literally roll up the sleeves to wear this tunic and it tends to be bothersome  hence t
-1,I love everything about this except the length. i am short and usually order a petite and even this is really cropped on me. the quality is good  thick and substantial  color is great but very cropped and sleeves are long on me as well. just weird proportions so sadly  going back.
-1,Bought two of these because i loved the way they fit off of the rack. washed them according to directions and they were ruined. the material shrank up making the shirt short and boxy and the side panels ended up being rippled. definitely going to try to return these.
0,Online  i like the design  the leaves stand out. in-person  the leaves don't stand out as much  you can barely see them they are so light. the top is slightly see-through. the price is high. i think this top would work better on a more slender frame. i like the top but the price is too high for the quality and thin fabric. it may look better on a slender frame  i think. it was just too light and thin for me.
0,Not for petite women  you need to have a long figure for this tunic to drape like it does on the model. if it ever goes on sale i will purchase it but not worth the full price for me at the moment.
0,I ordered this in a m and it was just a big boxy tent. i really wanted to love it since the length is good for leggings and throwing on to cart kids around. it just was so big and had no shape at all. it's possible i should have sized down to a small  but i'm sending it back.
0,Great summer skirt  can be dressed up or down. the band top is weird  but you don't have to style it as pictured. i may get the top hemmed down the road.    i have a 32 waist and got a size large.
-1,I bought this top in the blue motif and loved it so so very much until i washed it. it came out of the wash (delicate/cold cycle) with 3 small holes. i am devastated because it was destined to be my favorite top for summer. it is flattering  lightweight  gorgeous color  cool raw edges  v-back detail...i could go on and on about all the things i love about this top  but now it has holes after one washing so it's all for naught. do-over please with better fabric qa.
-1,I loved how soft this dress was  as well as versatile. however  i only got to wear it one time because after the first wash  a giant fabric tear happened on one of the seams. unfortunately  the fabric is so soft  but rather thin  and it didn't hold. the care instructions say machine washable but i wouldn't put it in the washing machine again. especially since i often have to wash clothes twice in the washer i use because it's so old and barely agitates. would love this if it was made a little be
1,I agree with others that the shape is not perfect  it does billow a bit by the hips. but the xxs petite (someone returned) was good on me. length was perfect  sleeve were not too tights. (30dd  26.5 in waist  35 in hips  115 lbs)  colors are subdued  making the jacket more neutral. keeping in mind for later...
-1,I really wanted to like this top  just got it in mail today  but unfortunately it did not work well for me because i'm 6 ft tall and the blouse was too short. i like the look and how it feels and i haven't completely decided whether to return it  but here are the issues i have encountered with this top. the blouse is very pretty and has a nice refreshing style with good print and color  very soft too  unusual for rayon of this type  feels more like thin delicate cotton. i got my top in red  size
0,I really liked this dress in so many ways. i'm tall and pear-shaped so the flowy shape is great for me. however  the deal-breaker was how the armholes were cut. it isn't that obvious in the photos  but they are cut in around the bust in the front in a way that was really weird looking on me  and it was too expensive to keep something that's unflattering. too bad  if they had just had a normal armhole it would have been a home run. lovely fabric and nice that it has pockets.
0,Plan to order at least one size smaller than you think  it's way baggy
1,Fun top for day or evening.
1,This is nicer than the first reviewer states. the fabric feels very soft and the tunic does not look cheap.the top of the tunic was a little more fitted so it was a little tight for me since i have wide shoulders. i will have to get a larger size.
0,"I like what they were going for here  and the fabric. but it falls short in that i can't wear it to work---the back ""keyhole"" is massive so i can't wear my normal bras  and the very wide neck also shows bra straps  so unless i want to go with a strapless bra  it's not useful for me. i want to feel loose and soft and summer comfy and my strapless bras are anything but that. i'd go without  but that is a no-no where i work. i may try getting a size smaller. i wear a med. and i got a small and mayb"
-1,I bought this online. this looked like a sweater that was accidentally shrunk in the dryer  when i received it.    i will be returning this.
-1,The model looks like she's 14 years old - this sweater of course would fit a younger teen. it definitely won't work for a grown woman. please make some longer sweaters.
1,Like other reviewers  i tried on a medium and a large as i usually take either size in retailer dresses. the large was huge on me - i had an extra 6 inches or so on each side. the next medium that i tried on could barely fit over my head! i looked at the tag to see if i had picked up an extra small but it stated medium. got another medium and it fit perfectly. however  the cami underneath one medium was again teeny tiny. the other medium was ok. you may have to try on a few dresses to get the righ
1,Cute top but does stretch out a bit throughout the day.
1,Fits pretty true to size  thick material  sits nicely.
1,This is a stunning dress. fits true to size  very high quality  has a very flattering shape  and the lace embroidery is gorgeous.
1,Nice loose-fitting dress to wear in the summer and to transition into the fall. i had no problem with the slip being too tight. 5'3''  118lbs  and went with my normal size 2. it was loose through the body but sizing down would have made the dress too tight on my shoulders. it's great with boots or flats!
-1,After washing this top pilled terribly. it is beautiful  but only for one use.
1,Wonderful fabric  drapes nicely from waist= flattering  use for air travel as not too heavy in weght. beautiful charcoal grey goes with all colors. nice addition to tight  patterned pants & boots. dress up or casual
1,I'm happy to say i got this on the sale rack but had been eyeing this long before.  it is a flattering fit on me in size large.  i just love the colors in the print!  also  the style is not a basic shell but a very feminine cut.  the skinny straps are also a very nice touch.  i plan on wearing this with my long white linen skirt  denim capris or with shorts.  i think i will also opt for a solid cardi or scarf.  this is just so pretty!
-1,Was excited to wear the dress for the first time. but while standing in front of the mirror putting makeup on  the seam between the body and sleeve just started to unravel. strangest thing - just a random hole appeared :(.
0,I love this sweater  so why a lower rating? while i love the material and the color  it lost all of its shape before i even left the house! i am a size 6 / small and it looked clownish on me before i ever got to my dinner party.  i plan to wash it this evening and i really hope that this brings it back to its original shape and keeps it.
-1,This tunic looks awesome in the picture. however  it is made of an uncomfortable sweater-like material not left of centers normal skin cotton. i was disappointed once i saw this in person. not a great material for summer.
-1,I saw this dress in the catalog and immediately ran to the store to purchase. then i realized the dress in the catalog is slightly different  but the small differences is what makes the catalog dress so much more unique and worth the money! look at the top  the stripe colors are different. and the stripes flow different on the skirt part as well. and the dress was short on me and i'm two inches shorter than the model. bummer.
-1,Material is awful. not soft at all. colors are much darker than shows online. it is actually very short not at all as it looks on the model. it went back.
0,I tried this dress on in the store today  and the armholes were so wide  it showed my bra under the arm almost to the bottom  and it showed part of the side cup of my bra at the front. while the dress seems like it will be really comfy  the arm cuts are so unnatural  i had to pass. i did try going down in size  and petite  and neither of those options worked to fix the situation.
-1,The top looks better on the model than in-person. it fits loose and looks boxy and matronly. i don't like the sleeve length or the top style  it just didn't look flattering or good. i am sending it back. looks very boxy.
0,This silk skirt was not the best look for me  but may work for others. i purchased the med  which fit fine. i just wasn't in love with the print/colors. the skirt has quality material and is well made. it's very light and airy. i did return it.
1,These cords are a great  skinny fit.  they seem true to size for me and look great on.  only issue i would have is the color says navy  but they are more of a deep purple-ish color.  i had to recheck my order because they definitely aren't navy....but i'm keeping them because the fit is awesome.
0,I was searching for the perfect large comfy sweater for the cold winter weather ahead and i thought this would be it. it looks so cute in the pictures but when i received in by mail it wasn't what i was searching for. this sweater  like on the model  is quite large. although i wanted a large sweater  the fit of this one didn't fit well on me. it has more of a boxy feel to it. i usually wear a medium  but went with a small because i expected this to fit a little large and it still engulfed me. i
1,Love the lightweight fabric! looks great with skinny jeans. it is flowy  but flattering.  wearing it on my shoulders for work -
1,I treated myself to get this at full-price at the start of summer. my size is xl and it fits me like the model photos. i have gotten such good use out of this blouse. it washes well without shrinking. it's vintage-looking. so comfortable. i love the arm coverage  interesting neckline that covers bra straps  good length. the cami it came with is flimsy so i threw it away. i use another tank underneath. i'd love any of the colors. the blus was more my color but all of them are gorgeous because of
0,"As other reviewers have noted  this is a pretty top. i really love the design. alas  however  it is too big for my frame. for reference i am barely 5'1"" and about 105 lbs. i ordered my usual xxsp and the fit is just not flattering on me. it is looser than on the model and the flounce does not hit me in the proper place. the top is also too wide so that it has these odd gaps near the armpits. i highly recommend this top unless you are an xxsp. i am going to have to part with it  sadly."
1,I love this jacket. it's easy to dress up or be casual. the black is more like a very dark grey.
0,"This skirt material and quality is top notch. i'm not a ""mustard yellow"" fan but the color combo in this is just stunning! i'm 5'4""  125#  27/4 usually and picked a 4 in this which would have been correct. the top bad is very thick so it was just too much at my waist. in the modeling pick she is covering about half the band with her tied tank top. this would look beautiful on anyone approx 5'6"" or over i think! oh  and the drape is beautiful  not super full."

0,The color and embellishment of this top are beautiful. this would look great on anyone super lean  otherwise you just look really wide as there is no frame in the torso of this top at all. the back picture shows it well. i am 5'9  142 lbs and i ordered the small and medium and both were huge! with regrets going back.
1,The model does not look as good in this shirt as it looks in real life. it is flowy  flattering  and elegant  not to mention warm and soft. i hope it holds up!
1,"Love the clean lines  the texture  and the slight sheen on this skirt which does run a bit large in the waist. the online photos are very true to what the fabric looks like. it is a stiffer  but lightweight fabric so the skirt stands away from the body. the quality of the finish is excellent and i really appreciate the hidden zipper and pockets. . fit: runs large in the waist. the size 2 i have measures 27"" on the top inside of the waistband  and i think the model is wearing a size too loose oth"
1,I was so excited to see these pants on sale. they fit beautifully and drape well. the hidden lining of 'shorts' is a great feature and i will get 3 seasons of use from these.  now if i could only get them in plain black too ....
-1,First of all it arrived rolled in a tight ball the size of a large starbucks coffee. i don't know why they do that.... you're not going to be immediately impressed by something that is packaged like it's cheap! second  i'm usually a 0-4 in retailer and mine is no where near as loose-fitting as the photo. also  he sleeves and back are a very thin waffle knit... like a flimsy t-shirt. and see-thru. the sleeves form-fit to my arms so i couldn't layer under it  but i couldn't wear it alone with the fa
-1,To be clear i am not built like your models but the biggest problem was the way in which it tented out from the bustline down
1,I like these pants. they fit nice but they are sheer which is not a problem for me. my only issue was that the print is not symmetrical as shown in the picture. the print is what drew me to these pants. the pattern is all over the place in the ones i received. they are nice so i will keep them at the sale price but i don't think they would be worth it at full price.
0,Not sure about this yet. reordered larger size because it hits much higher than shown. belly peeked out from under it! ordered 6 and i'm normally a small/6. like the design but really short. 
-1,I've never had a problem with pilcro jeans. i own several pairs. however  i ordered my regular size 28 (i'm 5'3  120 pounds) and not only were these jeans thin  they had zero stretch and after 1 hour of wear stretched out horribly. they fit really loose and hung around my knees and legs which is very disappointing for a skinny jean.
-1,Even following the care label exactly  it shrunk ~3 inches in the length and overall in the diameter. i had to return this since i am tall and it looked more like a work-inappropriate mini after the first wash.
0,Purchased this should in the blue motif in size small. i am usually between a small and medium in shirts  36c broad shoulders. the fit was fine in the small. however  i had a few issues with the top: 1) the blue motif looked actually like a faded blue (as if it had been washed quite a few times and looked worn)  2) the front mid/bottom section laid strangely and gave me a maternity look  and 3) the back has alot of fabric (see back of tank in white motif) and was very voluminous. for me  it wasn
-1,The dress is very pretty  but the sequins are dark blue! i imagined they would be silver/gold  given the photo  but the dress is essentially light pink and blue.
1,I just got this top and can't wait to wear it for spring/summer! it is a lovely lightweight material and hangs loosely and comfortably. it definitely runs quite large so i would at the very least consider ordering on the small side of what you normally wear if not sizing down one completely. this is coming from someone who usually likes tops on the roomier side  so trust me on this! overall  i highly recommend this top if you're looking for a muted but unique  comfy top for the warmer months ahe
1,Dolan is my go to for comfy  pretty  practical dresses. i'm 5'0 125 lbs and i consistently wear a petite small in this brand. i bought the taupe - not my favorite color  but i had too many lbds and the green was not a summer color. i chose taupe to wear with my bronze and turquoise jewelry. summer must have.
-1,I bought an xl and they looked like they would have been a small. can't review anything else because i couldn't even get them on.... ridiculous
0,I like the pattern and material on this top but the bubble hem isn't flattering on my figure. i would recommend this top if you are tiny and petite.
0,These are very well constructed  medium weight  besutiful leggings.
-1,This top is tight across the bust (i am a 32dd cup) and more trapeze-shaped than the picture shows. if you are smaller busted  it may not flare out as much. also- the sz 10 is what was tight - and i usually wear a sz. 4 or 6  or small-size top/blouse. in the end  this wasn't very flattering as it looked more like a maternity top.
1,I love this top! i debated between an xs and a s  but i'm usually an xs in deletta so that's what i got. it fits perfectly and is beautiful.
-1,Like one of the previous reviewers  when my jacket arrived  it was not in the great dark wash pictured online. it was in a basic  medium denim wash. i like the wash pictured online; i did not like the wash the jacket came in. additionally  know that it is just huge. i ordered my usual size (medium) and understood that the jacket was meant to be roomy and swingy  but there is no way that one size down would be enough to compensate for how swimmingly large it was. i never tried an xs  but it was s
-1,I loved this dress when i saw it online  perfect for a summer wedding  but when i tried it on i was very disappointed. the fabric and styling are gorgeous and very high quality but the sheer amount of fabric on this dress is just not as pictured. there is layer after layer of silk and ruffle and while lovely  it made me look very large. i tried tying the belt many ways to no avail. sadly  it will have to go back. it may look good on a very thin frame but didn't complement my average one.
0,I really wanted this swimsuit to work and it looks really nice in person and good quality as well  but sadly the top is cut really strangely. in the photo shown of the model  it looks like a v-neck that kinda gives your boobs a little push to the middle for some slight cleavage. however  that's not how it fit for me. the cups have removable padding on this suit  and when left in  my boobs didn't even fit in the thing and it just looked really awkward in general. and with the padding taken out  m
0,"Great cut and fit. tts. size 6 fit my 5'5""  135 pound frame (34b/c bust) wonderfully. my sister and best friend loved it on. but i'm returning. the color is more of a very bright orange than red. i would want to wear this in the middle of summer but the all-polyester fabric is hot. i have too many dresses in my closet. cute as it is  i'd just never pick this one. love to see this design in lighter fabric and different color options. 1-2"" longer would also be a slightly better length."
0,Gorgeous color! salmon not pink though! lovely soft drape fabric but the itty bity thread and hook in the center is awful! i am a size 2/4 d cup and ordered a small and the closure is not adequate at all! it looks terrible closed and is too revealing without a cami underneath. does not fit like the model!
1,Comfortable t eh fabric is very soft. the embroidery adds a little to the otherwise plain black tunic. lace up neck on trend too.     i ordered the xxs p  as it is likely loose... that was just fine for me  xs p would have been not as flattering. theo nly problem with that is the sleeves then became a little more snug (workout arms). not too snug that i can't wear the dress  but decided not to keep it only because there are way too many things i like at retailer! (and have to pick). in my wish lis
0,Note: if you have a large chest  the seams hit in an unflattering spot. nice shirt  just not great for the price.
0,"I don't usually write reviews but this one definitely needs it. i bought this shirt in the wine color in a small. i'm 5'6"" 135lbs and usually wear a small in retailer clothing. loved the color and fit of this shirt  a little longer and loose with unique detailing on the sides. i loved the wine color so much i bought the gray and white stripe one as well. when i bought the gray and white one i had to try on 5-6 smalls before finding one that fit just right. there was a significant difference in the"
-1,This dress looks amazing on-line. in person the arm ruffles are much larger and stick out  and the dress at the bottom makes you look like strawberry shortcake. too much all over ruffling at the chest and is not flattering. pattern is dizzying in person.     very thin multi layer dress. should be better material and quality for this price. save your money and shipping.
-1,I absolutely fell in love with these comfy palazzo pants and imagined that i'd be wearing them all summer long. they fit beautifully  were true to size  and seemed to go with every top i owned. unfortunately  on the second wear  the inseam completely unraveled  leaving a foot-long gaping hole in the leg. i also noticed some stray threads along the other seams  so i'm not thrilled with the quality. it seems like they were poorly manufactured. i'm not sure if i just purchased a faulty pair or if t
0,"This is really a cute top  nice fabric  the print (the version i bought) is lovely though the colors are different than pictured. the problem for me is that i am 5'8""  36b with a longer torso and the proportions were just wrong on my body. the blouse does not have much shape at all and fell a bit too short for my liking  especially in the front. it hit at hip level  as in photo  but would look so much better if it had been a couple inches longer. looking at the other reviews i see that most of t"
1,Perfect high rise jeans - just a little bit of stretch for comfort. the high waist doesn't roll down and no knicker cleavage when bending over. perfect to go with crop tops
0,Cute shirt but not worth the price. i did purchase it at 20% off but would have waited for a better sale. the yellow is a nice fall color
0,I am all for a cute flowy tee but this one felt like i was swimming a bit. if you're a true xs  i'd skip this one. however  if you are able to size down i think it would look really great!
1,"I've been desperate for a swim cover that covers my arms & back. this one fits nicely--just a pretty  feminine  happy summer top that still lets me be leggy. i can't see them in the photos  but the embroidery detail at the upper part of this top has little mirrors sewn among the dots. very fun! i'm 5'5"" and when i paired this with jean shorts  everything below the crotch was visible--so perhaps slightly shorter than it appears in the pics."
1,I love this shirt. it is so soft. not boxy at all. very flattering. my only complaint is that there aren't more colors!
-1,1. i like a shorter jacket  but this one was poorly made and poorly fit.  2. the sleeves were way too tight. i'm a size 10 or 12  and the large which would be a 14 had tight sleeves that wrinkled up my arms  and the hem of the sleeve turned inside out.  3. i ordered both a medium (size 10) and a large (size 14)   and neither hung right. the m too tight  and the large too loose in the body and too tight in the sleeves.  4. very polyester with lots of static.  5. cute idea  but not very good in pe
-1,I thought that this dress would be perfect for my 60th birthday  however i was disappointed when i received it. it is extremely heavy from the beading and i just did not find it pretty in person. it did nothing for me. also  it runs small and was tight.
1,Love the pattern on this lightweight cardigan and it is super flattering. i tried ordering the xs/s first because the next size up just sounded too big  but i ultimately had to order up for more room in shoulders and length in arms  though. i'm hoping the m/l fits without too much spare fabric because it really is a great piece.
-1,Nice quality fabric and design  but found the armhole cut weirdly and fit of upper bodice strange. wanted to love it but sadly sent it back
0,This is a cute dress but the fabric is very heavy and i didn't find it to drape well on me. it is a very heavy felted poly type of fabric. i ordered it for a specific event coming up this summer and the fabric will not work for warm temps. the style and design of the dress is great though. for reference it did fit fairly true to size. i wear a 0 or 2. the xs fit well. if the fabric works for your situation then i would try this dress.
1,Bought these pants for a long trip through south east asia. tried them on at home and instantly fell in love with the relaxed yet styled look. will be incredibly versatile on my trip which i need as i am bringing only ~15 pounds of luggage including the bag. they seem breathable and are light weight. super flattering as they are slightly slimming and don't bunch up at the waste. i got the greenish color.
-1,Waist is tight and thighs and legs are not. -not flattering- ankle opening is too small  and they have a funny smell.
-1,The cups on this suit are  ridiculous.  unless you are going to a nudist beach i do not recommend.  the construction of the suit itself was also vey poor. seams were messed up  a big pull right on the front-- i brought it back. sad because the design was adorable- just poor execution.
1,Omg! where have you been all my life? this t-shirt is the best....not see-through  perfect length  perfect v-neck (no cami required)  amazing colors  perfect shape  not tight (body skimming)  doesn't poof out or look weird on larger busts and goes with everything from jeans to dress pants. i want every color  but for now i ordered the moss and blue which goes perfectly with my fair skin and long silver hair. oh and did i mention the sleeves are perfect to wear with or without a cardigan! no slee
0,"I loved the color and the neckline was flattering. however  it would have fit me better in a petite size bc i am 5'3"" and a 32f. it fits slim so to fit in my bust it was too long. also didn't think the fabric was good quality for this price."
0,I liked the idea of this t-shirt dress for a great basic wardrobe staple; however  i feel that it was overpriced for the quality. it's a nice piece but i would wait for it to go on sale.
0,Absolutely stinning dress! statement piece for sure however i will agree with other reviews that the bust is small and has no give or wiggle room with the side zipper...one if those dreaded side zippers that you always fear breaking as you dress. sizing up would help but the waist then appears too big or bulky.. i am on the fence about whether or not it's a keeper ...definitely perfect for the smaller chested. i usually wear xs size 2/4 the 6 zipped the 4 nearly did but would've smashed. neverth
-1,"This dress is horrible. i can't believe they can get away with calling it a ""dress"". it should have been called a tunic or shirt. it looks like it is a soft flowing dress made out of nice material from the pictures  no way. it is made from sweatshirt material it is lifeless and is kind of stiff. it came to the top of my thighs. i can't find one nice thing to say about this dress and i do not recommend it. the picture does it so much more justice that it is worth."
1,While there us no clasp and this bra does require you to pull it over your head  i did not find it to be too difficult. i love that the bra stays in place and that i do not have to constantly pull it up throughout the day! it's quite comfortable too. i wish i had ordered the same bra with the straps too before they sold out of my size!
0,There is nothing special about this skirt. it's plain and incredibly dowdy looking. long and wide. i am usually between a small and medium. after reading the other review that said the waist ran small i went with a medium. it fit fine in the waist/hips.
-1,Just recently purchased and think it's ok for the price. would never pay full on this one & that's from an retailer shopper who's purchased plenty at full price. design is cute but definitely looks like a sleep shirt esp in the lighter color  so-so on construction - the bottom seams pucker slightly  the pockets bunch up weirdly (steaming/laundering don't help) & the shoulders also hunch up oddly. could be because of the thicker fabric sewn to the knit but laundering didn't help that issue either.
1,These pants have a very odd design but they are so soft and so comfortable i could not resist. going on a trip to key west and thought they would be great for the plane ride. they fit true to size. could not pass up as they were on sale.
-1,"I agree with other reviewers. it is beautiful but too tight around the chest. i am usually an xsmall and the xsmall was tight in the chest. i bought the small and it was still uncomfortable. sadly i had to return it. i am 5'4""  134 lbs and a 34c  by no means i am considered big chested so this is highly unusual."
-1,Cute top but started disintegrating after two washes. the delicate cutouts in the top tore apart. i machine washed it in the gentle cycle and didn't use the dryer. disappointed to have to discard the top after just buying it.
-1,This dress is cuter is person than online  but it has one huge issue - there is a teeny tiny button at the neck that is held on by a thread and requires fingers the size of a two year old to get open. it fell off the minute i tried to undo it. i can't believe these other reviewers didn't have the same problem. or  maybe they put a snap there instead. too bad.
-1,Unique jacket..... but when i put it on i felt and looked like charlie brown. this will be going back.
1,"Overall  this swimsuit is what i needed and have been looking for. i normally wear bikinis but i needed a one piece  and i wanted something unique and different. i ordered the chevron print  and i do love the colors and ""retro"" look of the swimsuit. if i could change a couple of things  i would have the legs and booty slightly more high cut -- but not much. and i might have wanted the option to take off some  if not all  of the straps. other than that  i do love it...and i doubt that anyone else"
0,The details on this dress were pretty  but it was super poofy and i felt like it made me look bigger than i am. maybe if you have a straight body and want to create curves this would work for that  but not great on an hourglass/pear shaped figure. fits tts.
0,Ordered this vest in both the xs and pxs. i liked the length and overall fit of the xs  however  i ended up returning both due to how the vest draped. the outer fabric is a bit more stiff which made the vest balloon out more then what i liked. overall  it?s not a terrible vest but just not for me.
0,This was pretty to look at: nice weight  lining  colors. i tried it on and whoa. ridiculously bad. i have broad shoulders and a small waist and this accentuated the broadness of my shoulders and eliminated any hint of shape below that. the model photo looks great  so i imagine this will look great on anyone with slim shoulders and narrow hips. definitely not for me  though...
1,This vest is the one thing i will wear all year round. i couldn't wait for this to arrive  it looks and fits just like the pictures. great quality and value  is very stylish and adds a little flair to a simple top and jeans outfit. i have worn it several times and  in addition to looking great does keep you warm.
1,This is quite long on my 5'1 frame but it's wool and will be amazing in the fall and winter. so happy i finally ordered this
1,I'm 5'2 and bought the dress in a petite medium. i like to buy clothes that i can wear to work and this dress was almost too short. if it were any shorter  it wouldn't have worked. if i were to buy it again  i'd probably go with a non-petite size. also  i ordered the dress online and i found two snags in it as soon as i pulled it out of the box. i don't think they will be terribly noticeable  but just beware that this dress will apparently snag easily. i plan to wear it with a purse without meta
1,I love the print of this dress; the deep blue really is striking. i agree with the other reviewers that it has no lining and therefore  it's hard to justify the price. i can't seem to part with it yet due to the lovely print and the off the shoulder style is romantic and flattering. still on the fence. . . it would be better as a sale piece.
1,I really like the style and cute stripes and i love the versatility of the design of this shirt. fits true to size and hides my stomach just in the right places
0,I love the way the mock neck style looks  but the shirt is cut very small. i realize it's supposed to stretch  but it's still very  very tight on  particularly in the shoulder area. if you like the style  i'd recommend sizing up.
1,Thin for this late in the season  but the colors are so pretty. i'm going to layer it over a long sleeve t  top with a cardi and pair with leggings. runs large. love the the unconnected slip. 5 stars.
1,I was looking for a romper for a long time which i don't need to care whether to wear bras after taking shower and relax. because of its design with a line on the top  no worries for a relaxed romper. the texture was not as silky as i wished but you will like this if you want a light on weight.
0,The sweater fits a bit awkward in the front. it draped more than i would have liked. also  the transition from the stripes to the solid gray felt non cohesive because of the stitching. returned the item.
-1,I can always count on retailer to sell unique pieces  so when i saw this sweatshirt online  i ordered it right away.  it&#39;s adorable and quirky  however  when i received it in the mail  it reminded me of something my grandma would wear.  the sleeves are puff sleeves and are really long  while the bottom of the sweatshirt hit pretty high on my waist that when i raised my arms my stomach was showing.  if this was a more tailored sweatshirt  i would be keeping it  but sadly it&#39;s going back.
-1,I do not even know where to begin with this product. i ordered a small (i go between small and medium) and felt that would be a good fit. after trying on the shirt  i would have opted for the xxxxxxxxs or whatever the smallest size is. this shirt is very boxy. i know its supposed to have a 'flow' to it  but this shirt is too much. it needs to be taken in. or have a belt wrapped around it. i tried the belt look but it did not look flattering. i found this color to be very blah. overall  i am slig

-1,This shirt is so small. i am not sure who came up with the sizing but you have to go up several sizes to get a comfortable fit. don't waste your time on this shirt. such a shame  it could have been very cute.
0,The shade of orange was quite muddy and not vibrant like photos show. it's going back .
-1,This dress had so much potential. looked cute when i received it. put it on & couldn't wait to take it off. it's shapeless  top heavy & just overall unflattering. the material could be cute....on a totally different dress. don't waste your money.
1,"I am 5-9 1/2"" tall  150 lbs  i bought the 8 in the honey color. they fit perfectly. there is some stretch and they are super soft! which for some reason is totally why i buy clothes. the length is good since they are capris. also  they did not have my size in store  so they had them shipped  for free  to my home. received them within 3 business days.    i would very much recommend them for a casual  fun look. the honey color will look great with navy  grey  and white for summer."
1,I tried these on on a whim because i liked the shirt that they were displayed with in the store and was surprised how much i liked them! they are a great lighter weight alternative to the pilcro hyphen chino. great for hot days of summer.  the subtle vertical stripes go with everything and help elongate the leg. overall a really flattering cut. the waist is not too low and does not create muffin top.
-1,Ditto what the first reviewer said  unfortunately. i was so looking forward to receiving this dress but the one received is not the one in the photos. the graphics are fantastic - still love the boats- but the top is not the same and they've added a fabric belt to the finished dress. the fit was perfect except for gapping under the arms (similar  i suspect  to what the first reviewer reported). i was also surprised by the fabric. based on the photos i was expecting something light and semi trans
1,Very cute and flattering. very fitting in legs and thighs and i have fairly slim legs. i am a size 6 and 6 was very snug. i recommend trying these on in store or trying several sizes to see best fit.
-1,The color  design and fabric of this top (got it in the red) were just as i expected  but as the owner of several deletta brand tops  i was very surprised to find that my usual size small runs very large in this tank. not only did the front dip too low but so did the arm holes  and the top just hangs on me. it was so big for a small that it almost made me think it had been mislabeled and was really a size large.   bummed to return it because i really love the color and the style. will try an x-s
1,I love love this top.  it is so pretty!  i am stopped by strangers complimenting me on it. it is so flattering.  i wear a cami under it and find it perfect!  it hits at the perfect length below the waist on my jeans.  it's easy to throw on and go.  casual but dressy.  the sleeves do bell out so you may need to watch them when you eat.  i've accidentally caught them on my plate.  the shirts washes well.
1,The material and design of this beach dress is so pretty. i was hoping that this could be worn as both a dress and a swim suit cover-up  but it is only the latter. you can't see it from the photos (the model or mine)  but it is very sheer.... it can really only be worn over a swimsuit. whatever you wear (or don't) will be completely visible. so if you are looking for just a lovely  unique beach dress  this is it! unfortunately for the price i need more versatility! i will consider it on sale!
1,I saw this t on sale and ordered it. i had second thoughts  thinking it would be just like a lot of ts i already have. well  i got it today and am thrilled. the fabric is so soft  a sumptuous softness that makes me feel good. the fit is the fit we all want in a great t  nice fit  not too baggy  not too tight  and it is so flattering. it doesn't show off my tummy as so many other ts do. i can wear this with jeans or a skirt. so glad i got it!
-1,I fell in love with this shirt the moment i saw it!  unfortunately  when i went to put it on  there was a hole running down the seam in the back. i went to store to exchange  wore the shirt  and someone tells me i have two holes in the back of my shirt. horrified  i went home  took a look  both holes along the seam! i will be returning this  i really liked this shirt!
1,Velvet always has made quality clothing and i had purchased the same shirt in another color and i wanted to see if they had other colors  they did and i got 2 more. i received in expected time and they were wrapped nicely. thank you for great choices of unique clothing.
0,I tried this on at the store  and though it was pretty  i was a little underwhelmed. it fit but had no give so it might not have been too comfortable for movement unless sized up. the embroidered polka dots were a lovely idea  but the quality was not great - they were already fraying and pretty irregular looking. the idea of the top was better than the execution.
0,After reading the reviews i decided to give this a try  but it just didn't work on me. i'm 5'8  smaller on top  and usually wear m in retailer sizes. this was ok in the shoulder and arm area but a little too snug for me in the hips. also  the diagonal striping made my boobs disappear and the pattern at the bottom emphasized my tummy and rear. not exactly the look i was going for. back it goes.
-1,I love the colors of this dress  and i waited for the sale since it isn't really good for work. i wear size 6 in hd all the time  but this one doesn't fit at all on the top. the bust is cut for someone really curvy  but the bottom is for someone really straight. i don't know what they were using for a model  but this has to be tried on before purchased. the material is also rough  and there is no lining to protect you from that. i love my hd dresses for style and functionality  but this one is j
0,Nice jeans  just fyi they look more slimly fitted in the photo than they actually are when you get them. that's why i returned them. otherwise  fine.
0,I loved this dress and ordered it online. i found the colors to be a bit more muted than i expected  and unfortunately the fabric quality seemed low considering the price point. ultimately i decided to return it as i couldn't justify spending $178 on a dress that didn't seem as well made as i would expect from retailer.
-1,These jeans were so cute on- wore them a handful of times and they'd been washed twice. put them on and - rip! ripped right at the crotch in the front so not fixable- and on vacation no less when i had to scramble to find something else to wear. poor quality - disappointing and not what i expected from retailer. :-( they also run large even for a more relaxed fit- sized down for a good fit.
0,I was confused by this dress. the heavy fabric made me think of winter but the cut and print are springy. it's also not lined and the material is not exactly soft. i put it back. cute  but missed the mark.
-1,I ordered this dress in the blood orange and have a few complaints. while it appears to be made with quality  it runs really large. also  in the picture the fabric appears to have a sheen and be somewhat dressy. the actual fabric is just flat cotton. it's a very casual dress  not as dressy as pictured. it's also quite shapeless on. i'm returning it.
0,I had high hopes for this top. really boxy  short
0,I absolutely love the look of this shirt with the built in layering piece. the overall garment is lightweight and not too heavy even with the added layer. however; this runs really large. in general  this brand runs large for me and i would say that if you are used to this brand  you can stick with your normal sizing for this brand. however; compared to other brands it runs very large. i think it would work fantastic for me in a different size. it is not at all fitting so it would be more like a
1,I have a few pair of these from prior years and would like another in a dark color. every time i check  the size 24 regular are sold out! please make more size 24!
-1,The minute i put this sweater on  i couldn't wait to take it off. it was way too scratchy for me. so  for those with any type of sensitivity to wool  this is not the sweater for you. otherwise  i thought the design was quite cute.
0,"There isn't much shape to this dress. it's fairly straight from top to bottom. i'm smaller on top with a small waist but slightly pear shaped. the top half was somewhat loose but the bottom half just clung too much. i'm 5'2"" and 107 lbs and bought a pxs for reference. also  i wore a tee shirt underneath and the dress shed all over it."
0,Really wanted to love this  especially with the lacing and long length for this off-the-shoulder top. when the top arrived  the lacing was stiff and length of the straps were long so that the bottom of the lace didn't completely cover my black strapless bra (and i felt it sat a bit too low down my chest). thought about taking in the straps but then the area around the armpits would be uncomfortable. i did love the length of the top though. wish this top was a keeper  but going to have to return.
1,"This jacket is a great fit and feels like a nice  comfortable addition to a professional/work wardrobe. it is very lightweight and fits somewhat loosely. i am 5""7 and 125 lbs and the small fits nicely. the only con is that there is not a way to secure down the top payer of the wrap )no snap  button  etc.)."
-1,It is soft and hangs great. problem - i wore it one time - and the back balled up terrible. it looked like i had owned it for years - not worn it one time. wouldn't recommend. though it is sooooo soft!
-1,The top on the model in the photo is a true ivory  but the top in reality is more beige. well  i'm blonde with fair skin  so i'm not sure this is going to work. it also looks more dressy in the photo than it does in reality -- i think the ivory color on the model and the pleats only down the front make it look more dressy -- but in reality  with it really being beige  having pleats everywhere  and being a crinkly fabric  it looks more casual. i had wanted it to be more dressy to pair with skirts
1,Love this shawl/wrap! was looking to purchase the white & warren cashmere poncho (but available online only)  and then saw this in the store. tried it on and fell in love. love that it's 100% cashmere -- super soft and warm. would recommend!
0,An odd top.  for my curvy figure (34g)  the seam did not enhance  but rather made me look wider.  the material is...interesting. foam-like is all i can think to describe it. the fabric and design are not as elegant looking in person.
0,"In the photo of the dress  you might have a hard time telling that the top half of the dress is the ""lace"" part  and is a stretchy knit fabric  while the bottom half is polyester and not stretchy at all. fyi: 36c (34d)  short waist  broad shoulders/back  usually a 10/12 in a fitted top/dress the navy lace of the top  as i said  is knit. therefore it was too stretchy  and the straps actually were already too long. it was so loose  that i needed the smaller size in the top half of the dress (10)."
0,The sweater is nice but is very thin. it is see-through which does not make it a good fall/winter item for me. the design & structure of the sweater is nice & looks slimming on which is a bonus. i originally ordered my regular size (s) but had to upgrade to a large in order to get the neck to fall on my shoulder as shown in the picture. this wasn't a problem since the sweater is form fitting so getting the larger size did not make it look too big. overall  i did not keep the seater as i thought
0,This dress looks cute in the picture and i was hopeful since it was actually silk. i'm tired of paying close to $200 for dresses that are polyester or viscose. that being said  this dress simply had too much going on. the fabrics aren't only mixed  but there is also a faint underlying pattern on the fabric that is the same shade of the main color of fabric. it was simply too much and the black lace trim made it look kind of cheap. my real issue is that although the dress itself ran big  the uppe
-1,I was very disappointed by the fit of this top. it is quite short (especially in the back) and very wide. i did not find it flattering. on a positive note  the fabric is nice and thick - very warm layering piece for fall. for sizing reference  i'm 5'5''  122 lbs  and took my usual size xs.
1,Loved this skirt. it reminded me of the styles that i saw visiting paris this past summer.
-1,The cut of this piece is great  the quality of the fabric is terrible. i used it under another layer the first day i wore it and it pilled across the bust. after hand washing in cold water and hanging to dry it shrank in length- so much that i can no longer even wear it. i always happily pay a premium for quality staple wardrobe pieces. this didn't hold up to one wearing  let alone one season. i recommend strongly against it.
0,This is such a cute top with so much potential  soft fabric  vibrant colors and flattering fit on top. however like so many of retailer swing tops lately it has tons of fabric at the bottom making it billow in a very unflattering way. i ordered it in an xxsp so i can't even go down in size so this top  regrettably  has to go back.  i love swing tops but retailer  could we please have tops that do not double for maternity tops??
-1,I got the blue. it is very short. one side of the shirt i received was shorter that the other. the material feels cheap and pleats out a bit right over the bust - only flattering on small busted models.
-1,"I usually wear a medium and bought a small. it fit ok  but had no shape and was not flattering. i love baby doll dresses and tops  but this was a tent. my daughter saw me try it on and said ""that's a piece of tablecloth."" it's going back."
0,I do like this top. i bought the cream color and it is flattering  but it is a little shear. i need to wear a cami underneath it. it also seems to be a little on the large side.
-1,Wanted to love this dress  bit it wasn't to be. strange fit  and doesn't drape nicely  as in the photo. also  the blue color was much darker in person. wouldn't recommend.
0,"I tried these on in the store  and they are super cute but run small. i typically wear a size 25 (i'm 5' 5"" and 108 lbs.) and they were too tight for me. i like the fabric and the cut; i think they'd be great one size up. (my store didn't have them.)"
-1,The skirt is just okay. the design is great but the material is extremely thin and see through. there is a slip which goes to mid-thigh- very strange and felt weird as well. the pleats are okay but not great. overall  it is not worth paying full price for or anywhere near that. and again  be wary of it being see through.
1,This sweater is a perfect transition piece!  the material is really soft. while it has the shape of a poncho it is cut nicely and doesn't make you look like a big blob.
-1,The color is as pictured. good quality. it's lined. the zipper in the back makes it look updated. i ordered my usual size. small petite size 6. it fit perfectly. i'm 5 feet and 120 lbs. hourglass figure. i had high hopes. i have hips and short  heavy legs. the skirt only emphasized my flaws. if you've got great legs you will do well with this. i do own other short skirts. but the fact that is less tailored in look makes it better suited for a younger gal. if you're on the fence give it a try. it
0,I can't figure out if this skirt is supposed to be high-waisted (if so  it's too big but the length works)  or if it's supposed to sit on my hips (fits well but too long). but the material is really comfortable  and the design is different in a good way.
-1,I love off the shoulder looks and had high hopes for this top. unfortunately the folded top portion doesn't stay down at all. i found myself pulling at it all day and eventually gave up. the material is also not the best.
1,I love love this top and bought it in both colors. it runs a tad big but fits me well. both l and xl fit me well  but the xl was longer so i have one in each size. i really like this top. it looks good  goes well with most pants especially blue  and is very comfortable. i am very happy with my purchase.
0,Really wanted to love dress but something was off with fit. fabric is lovely and zipper detail nice unfortunately style was not for me.
-1,I loved this shirt when i got it. it fit perfectly  and was so soft. but when i washed it  following the instructions  it shrank up to well above my belly button. i'm talking 6 inches of shrinkage  at least.
-1,I ordered these pants in my usual size (xl) and was shocked when i received them. the waist was huge and there was nothing in the way of an elastic or tie to keep them up. i couldn't keep them on so  of course  back they go! too bad! the sweater quality is great.
1,"I bought the one with blue and white top and black bottom. absolutely loved it! i am 5""2 so the dress is part is a bit long for me---ended up wearing my 4.5 inch heels to make it fit. the fabric is more heavy than what it seems in the pictures. but that makes it more formal. it's great!"
1,I wish i could buy this is more colors! so easy to dress up or dress down
0,This top has nice quality lace but the layout is strange! it wouldn't stay under my boobs but kept creeping up and looked strange! not for girls with a chest!
-1,I wished these fit a little better. unfortunately  they were a little tight in the thighs and if i didn't pull the waist of the pants up  i had sagging crotch and the pockets hung out. needless to say i made a return.
1,This top is super cute. the color is beautiful and the lace detail is very feminine. im a 36c and got the size small. it fits great.
0,I'm a bit disappointed in this top. i'm keeping because retailer's shipping rates are obnoxious and i don't have a store near me. by the time i pay for shipping both ways  i could have paid for 1/2 the shirt. the loft has some very similar tops for about 1/2 the price. i love meadow rue  and their material is fabulous  but the design is off on this one. you can't size down because the armholes and top are fitted  but the bottom is a tent. not my usual style  as i'm short  with a short waist. this
1,I find it very hard to find a dress. never like the way they look on me..this one???? fits like a glove  flatters my silhouette (which is difficult because even though i am at a good weight my waist is never small). looks like million bucks on me....i love it!!!
1,These are some of the few pants that are semi loose with a wide waist band that make me look thinner! i love them. they are soft! they match everything. they make an outfit effortlessly chic. i took a size m and it fit tts.
1,I absolutely love these pants! i have been searching for a pair of linen pants for quite a few years but have never really found a pair that looked good on me until now. i have usually found linen pants to lack shape and end up making me look frumpy but i really love the fabric. well  these pants actually have some structure to them and are still super comfy and soft. i bought the neutral color which is acutually a very fine tan and white pinstripe which makes the pants a bit more classy. i love
0,I loved this shirt online and ordered it in blue immediately even though i usually hesitate to spend over $100 on casual blouses. unfortunately  i was super disappointed when it arrived. the lace does not contrast as much as shown in these pictures and it just doesn't look all that special. having said that  it is super comfy and soft and the sizing is generous - it may run big on you if you have a small chest. all in all  i would buy it on sale but certainly not worth the price tag!
0,I really like the color of this and the feel  but that is where it ends. it does not come with the gorgeous flattering belt that it is pictured with  and is cut without shape so it does not fit to your body and show off any glorious womanly curves. i could purchase the belt with it  but i don't prefer to purchase products that cannot stand on their own.
-1,"Let me start off by saying how pretty this top is  and heavy .and itchy!  you would have to stand like the model does in the first shot to wear the top (with your arms not touching any part of the top!  the sequins will itch if you put your arms down (underneath the armhole).  another reason i didn't like the top was because the should straps are unadjustable.  i would have to get mine tailored for my 5'2"" frame.  i usually wear a medium or 6/8 in tops and ordered this in a medium  it was roomy."
-1,"I bought this online with the intention of it being my graduation dress. i'm 5'2""  115 pounds so i should've known better and gotten a ""petite"" style dress. however  i loved the modern look of this and since my boobs are a bit bigger (34d) i figured they would help fill it out. upon receiving the dress  i was first shocked that for the price  the construction was pretty poor quality: there were strings coming out of the straps and they looked unevenly sewn. when i put it on  it was clear that th"
1,This is a cute top. not perfectly made  a little boxy  but also not a crop top on me (5'5). it looks cute with high waisted jeans.
1,Great jacket! warm as a coat yet thin enough to wear indoors. i dress up with a fitted dress  or dress down with jeans. very versatile and comfortable. i always get compliments on it.
1,This is the most flattering shirt--love the fit and color!
1,I wanted to love this top. unfortunately  the color & fit didn't work for me. i'm a 36ddd. the fit was ok  it even flattered my bust  i just felt the stripes didn't flatter my waist. this would be perfect for an athletic frame.
